Western Province have moved swiftly to sign five new players ahead of the 2017 rugby season.Province snatched the Blue Bulls duo of Dan Kriel and SP Marais, while Johan du Toit, Ramone Samuels and Stefan de Wit also made a move to the coast.Kriel, who can play as a winger or centre, is the twin brother of Bulls and Springboks centre Jesse Kriel, while Du Toit, who is a talented flanker, is the brother of Stormers and Springboks lock Pieter-Steph du Toit.With Jesse Kriel and Warrick Gelant back to full fitness and Ulrich Beyers back in Pretoria, there looked to be no space for Marais, who was given a chance after a failed stint with the Sharks.The fullback is expect to be an understudy to the diminutive Cheslin Kolbe, who has made the No15 jersey his own at the union.Province director of rugby Gert Smal spoke highly of the union s new acquisitions. These players will all provide important depth in a squad that has recently been bolstered by a number of key contract extensions among the current playing group, Smal said. In Stefan de Wit we have a genuine open-side flank who plays towards the ball, which should bring some balance to our loose forwards. Du Toit is a powerful player with a good rugby brain who can cover more than one position in the back row. Samuels is a hooker who has shown great potential and I am looking forward to seeing him grow in our set-up. Marais is an experienced head at the back, while Dan Kriel is an exciting player who has great versatility. Smal s words were echoed by province president Thelo Wakefield, who said the new signings were in line with the union s vision. We are a proud union and in terms of our vision 2020 strategic goals, we are looking to put in place the right playing and coaching structures and personnel, Wakefield said.The Stormers will play a pre-season match in which they will face off against the Cheetahs in Harare later this month.They will begin their 2017 Super Rugby campaign against last season losing finalists, the Lions, at Newlands early next month.MMASEKEPE MATSEBANEmmasekepem@thewage.co.za
