Ex-Sunderland manager David Moyes was on Friday fined 30,000 ($38,000, 34,000 euros) for suggesting to a female reporter in March she might &#8220;get a slap&#8221;, England&#8217;s Football Association announced.Moyes, 54, made the remark, for which he apologised, to BBC reporter Vicki Sparks following Sunderland&#8217;s 0-0 draw with Burnley in the Premier League on March 18.The FA said Moyes&#8217; remarks were &#8220;improper and/or threatening and/or brought the game into disrepute&#8221;.Moyes was unhappy with one of Sparks&#8217; questions and said to her: &#8220;You were just getting a wee bit naughty at the end there, so just watch yourself. You still might get a slap even though you&#8217;re a woman. Careful the next time you come in.&#8221;Although the interview was over at the time Moyes made his remark, the camera was still running and footage of the incident was published three weeks later by a national newspaper. Moyes was contrite about the incident when questioned at a subsequent press conference.&#8221;In the heat of the moment, I made a mistake in my comments to a BBC reporter, which I profoundly regret. I was disappointed with myself for it,&#8221; said Moyes, who resigned as Sunderland boss following their relegation from the Premier League.&#8220;I subsequently phoned the reporter and apologised, which she accepted. It&#8217;s not my character, it&#8217;s not my type, as most people know and once again I apologise for it.&#8221;The club described Moyes&#8217; conduct as &#8220;wholly unacceptable&#8221; but stood by him as he attempted &#8211; in vain &#8211; to preserve Sunderland&#8217;s status among the English footballing elite.Moyes denied the charge but the FA&#8217;s independent regulatory commission upheld it.-AFP
