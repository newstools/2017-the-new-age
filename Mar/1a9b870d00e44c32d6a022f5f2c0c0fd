The South African Weather Service has on Monday warned beach-goers to stay away from the North beach in Durban as the waves are still high.Forecaster Stacey Colborne for KZN said people should be very careful because the ocean will be rough for the next few days.The wave was about 4.5m high on Monday morning but was expected to decrease during the course of the day. However the sea was expected to be rough for the rest of Monday and on Tuesday.Colborne said the cause of the wave was due to a combination of factors with the swell boosted by a south-westerly wind experienced along the coast from Saturday night into Sunday morning.The North beach was declared unsafe on Sunday after massive wave swells crashed onto the promenade.Rescue Care paramedic Garrith Jamieson said that they were supervising the area to make sure that that it was safe.&#8220;Durban lifeguards are at the beach to oversee the situation, they are very well trained and have a lot of experience.&#8220;On Sunday they were walking on the promenade just to warn people,&#8221; Jamieson said.Mandisa Magwaza
