Cape Town features among the world s top tech cities according to a recent report by global property giant Savills.Ranked number 22 in the report, entitled Tech Cities 2017, Cape Town, along with Santiago and Buenos Aires, is recognised as a major tech hub with potential as a rising global player.The Savills Tech Cities report explained the many, diverse factors that made places a good location for the tech sector and identified the 22 global centres at the forefront of tech, all of which have thriving and growing tech industries, home grown start-ups and incubators.They are also at the top of global shopping lists for tech companies looking for space in which to locate.Chief executive of Pam Golding Property Group, Dr Andrew Golding, associated with Savills, said: Cape Town is internationally acclaimed for a host of factors, not only its natural beauty and lifestyle, but also its world-class services and as a vibrant urban environment. According to the city of Cape Town s Economic Performance Indicators Report, Cape Town is widely considered as a tech and e-commerce hub within South Africa and therefore an appealing destination from which to run an e-commerce business. There is also an ongoing focus on high-tech advancements with a high-speed internet programme being rolled out in the Western Province. Add to this Cape Town s numerous accolades as a top global city and it s easy to see why it is popular as a prime tourist and conference destination as well as an increasingly sought after location for corporate headquarters. Among other factors, the cities highlighted in the report were assessed for factors such as buzz and wellness which included health of the urban environment, quality of parks, crime rates, healthcare, pay equality and commuting times, while city buzz considered nightlife, entertainment and cultural offer.Notably Cape Town features ninth on the Savills buzz and wellness index and second on the cost of living rank (excluding property costs).The final component of the report took into account property costs such as the cost of renting commercial property for a scale-up and established tech company, and the cost of renting residential property for employees.Golding said: Cape Town is world-renowned as a top value proposition for property investment, both residential and commercial.In the past decade and particularly in recent years, Cape Town s central city has attracted huge investment in regard to residential, mixed-use and commercial property investments and successfully evolved into a leading and trendy live, work, play destination. Top rated in the Savills report was the US s Austin as the world s foremost tech city, offering the infrastructure, business environment, talent pool and lifestyle to make it a strong base for tech companies.Two other US cities San Francisco and New York were ranked second and third respectively, followed by London in fourth. Access to venture capital and talent give US cities a lead over other global centres, Savills says, but Austin beats San Francisco to the top of the table because it has lower real estate costs and is so successful in attracting tech talent.However, while US cities dominated the top of the Tech Cities 2017 rankings, the rest of the top 10 consisted largely of such liveable cities as Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Toronto, which appear above traditional established global tech rivals such as Hong Kong and Singapore.This is due to the strong performance of these cities in terms of buzz and wellness Savills says, with the firm noting these as factors likely to prove increasingly important to the tech industry in attracting future talent.On this basis, Berlin, London and Tokyo were the highest ranking. Berlin was the only city which appeared in the top five cities for all three metrics (buzz, wellness and cost of living) and ranks first.London and Tokyo, despite having lower wellness scores, were global metropolises and therefore were boosted by their buzz rating.Amsterdam was ranked fourth and Toronto fifth, after scoring highly in both wellness and buzz while remaining affordable locations in which to live.Copenhagen is ranked 11th in the index due to its high living costs, but is notable for being the world s foremost tech city in terms of wellness and was therefore one to watch, Savills says.-TNA Reporter
