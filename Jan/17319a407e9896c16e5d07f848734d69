A report into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of psychiatric patients has been postponed. It was due to be released tomorrow.The office of the health ombudsman yesterday said this followed Gauteng health MEC Qedani Mahlangu s request for an extension.Mahlangu was provided with a draft interim report into the deaths of 37 psychiatric patients on January 6 to study it and respond. She agreed to give feedback by January 13 but has now requested an extension.She has been given until January 24 to respond. I am disappointed but not surprised that MEC Qedani Mahlangu has requested extra time to respond to the findings, the DA s Jack Bloom said.Bloom said he expected the findings to be devastating and that Mahlangu and her senior officials could be held criminally liable.A total of 37 patients died after they were relocated from Life Healthcare Esidimeni centres to NGOs across the province.This was after the provincial health department terminated its long-running contract with the facility to cut costs.Last week, Christine Nxumalo, whose sister died after she was sent to the Precious Angels NGO, said she was nervous but looking forward to the release of the report.Nxumalo is also awaiting a postmortem report into the cause of her sister s death. I m hoping there is at least accountability. My sister died in their care and I m hoping that someone will held accountable, Nxumalo said.leratod@thenewage.co.za
