Springbok Sevens captain, Philip Snyman applauded his team&#8217;s effort after the Blitzboks clinched the World Rugby Sevens Series title in Paris on Sunday.&nbsp; We executed well, but massive credit must go our management team in this regard. They laid out the perfect game plan and we just executed that. The system worked perfectly, not only this weekend, but also all season and they deserve credit for that,&#8221; said Snyman&nbsp;Synam is optimistic that this victory is only the beginning. We set out to win as many tournaments as we can, so nothing has changed now that we have won the series. The Blitzboks will still go out there and give everything they have to win in London. We are not letting our standards down, The Springbok Sevens team will be crowned the 2016/2017 series champions in London in the coming week during the conclusion of the series with London Sevens at Twickenham. After winning in Dubai earlier in the season the Blitzboks won the Paris sevens title as well. They finished their tournament campaign after Fiji and England unsuccessfully bowed out of the competition . We actually did not know that England lost their semifinal match against Scotland as we were warming up for our own semi against New Zealand. We knew that we would be series champions if we beat New Zealand, so went out with all guns blazing to win that one, which we did. We were champions already and did not even know, Snyman said.-TNA Reporter
