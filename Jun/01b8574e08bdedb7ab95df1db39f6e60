South Africa needs to promote participation of the majority of the country’s population in the economy by making sure that they become real industrialists and owners of manufacturing companies, Minister of Trade and Industry Dr Rob Davies said. He was speaking during the launch of the first phase of the R42m revitalised Babelegi Industrial Park in Hammanskraal, north of Pretoria, yesterday. The Babelegi Industrial Park project is part of the revitalisation of industrial parks programme of the department. The park has 261 developed units which are available for leasing and 188 of the units are occupied by firms operating in textiles, engineering, construction, light manufacturing, warehousing and distribution houses. Davies said greater involvement of the people in the economy is important, not just being shareholders, they must be involved and hardworking manufacturers of goods. The department’s Black Industrialist Programme was there to support them through incentives and access to markets, he said. “The revitalisation of the industrial parks programme is speaking to industrialisation and represents the efforts to move away from exporting raw material and commodities and move up the value chain while creating much needed employment. And while we move forward, we must not just do it alone as South Africa, but with the rest of the continent,” Davies said. -SELLO RABOTHATA|sellor@thenewage.co.za
