Legal analyst Nwora Okonkwo believes the DA&#8217;s court bid to review Brian Molefe&#8217;s reappointment as Eskom CEO is premature since he has approached the Labour Court to have is removal declared unlawful.&#8220;Pending the outcome of the labour court hearing, we will then see what happens because I don&#8217;t see how a judge will give a ruling on a matter that is yet to be decided,&#8221; said Okonkwo.On Monday Molefe&#8217;s urgent application in the Labour Court was not heard and it remains unclear when the matter will be heard.The DA&#8217;s James Selfe said an order would be taken in the North Gauteng High Court today, by agreement that Molefe would not attend work at the Eskom head office or at any of its sites, for the purpose of performing any duties, subject to the completion of his Labour Court matter where after the DA s review application would be set down for hearing.Meanwhile the DA said that its application to review Molefe s reappointment would proceed, even if his Labour Court application succeeds. We intend to intervene in the Labour Court proceedings at once. His urgent court action is nothing more than desperation, Selfe said.-TNA Reporter
