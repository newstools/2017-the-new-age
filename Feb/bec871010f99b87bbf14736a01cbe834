Security forces were searching territory in Mali and Burkina Faso on Thursday for a Colombian nun kidnapped by self-declared jihadists, a Malian security ministry source said.Gloria Cecilia Narvaez Argoti, 56, was seized by armed men in the village of Karangasso close to the Burkina Faso border on Tuesday night.&#8221;The search goes on. We have men on the ground,&#8221; the source told AFP.&#8221;We have also alerted the authorities in Burkina Faso who are mounting searches from their side because the group headed in the direction of the border,&#8221; the source added.Two arrests have been made in Mali after four men seized the nun and drove her away in a vehicle belonging to her Franciscan order.In Bogota, the head of the order said the men had said they had &#8220;an order to kill&#8221; when they grabbed her, adding that she had spent six years in Mali.Edmond Dembele, secretary general of the Episcopal Conference of Mali, said the community was &#8220;very worried&#8221;.&#8221;The border areas are vast and often uninhabited, and are opportune for hiding,&#8221; the priest added.There has not been a claim of responsibility for the kidnapping so far, but attacks in the south of Mali by jihadists, a threat that was once confined to the restive north, have become increasingly common.Last month, Al-Qaeda&#8217;s affiliate in North Africa released a new proof-of-life video of Swiss missionary Beatrice Stockly, who has been held hostage by the group for more than a year.The Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) video showed Stockly, who was captured in northern Mali, saying she was in good health .-AFP
