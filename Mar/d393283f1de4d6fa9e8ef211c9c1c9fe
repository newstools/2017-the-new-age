Last week he was unemployed, almost down and out. Today, it is all different.Thanks to The New Age, Thokozani Mnisi, 27, began a new life as a maths teacher at the Edusa College in Pretoria yesterday.Mnisi, a qualified maths teacher from Witbank, was found sleeping on the streets near the city of Tshwane s administrative and council building.He had been unemployed for more than six years when the newspaper highlighted his case.A week after his story was published, Strike Matotoka, the principal of Edusa College, attended to his plight by giving Mnisi the opportunity to teach maths at his college also giving maths lessons to pupils who need extra classes.Yesterday, with tears welling in his eyes, he expressed his emotions. I am so excited about this opportunity. I feel like this is a dream. I can t believe I am finally in a class teaching, he said.Upon our arrival at the college, Mnisi had just been assigned to his first lesson.For his introduction to a class of about 50 pupils, he helped the class solve what seemed to be a complex equation in just under a minute. He is brilliant. I love his tenacious spirit and passion for maths, Matotoka said.Matotoka said that he employed Mnisi due to the lack of mathematics teachers in the country. Maths is a very important subject that our education system has been overlooking, and I think that it is our responsibility to uplift it, he said. All that people need in life is to be given opportunities. Our college does not have financial resources all we can do is to give him a chance. Thokozani has a bright future. When his grandmother, Manyana Mnisi, 78, was asked how she felt, she said she was proud that her grandson was able to find employment to teach the subject he loves.Hlengiwe Motaungnews@thenewage.co.za
