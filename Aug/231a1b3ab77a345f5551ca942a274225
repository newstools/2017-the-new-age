The Democratic Alliance (DA) says that it has approached the Public Protector on Thursday to probe the alleged wasteful expenditure by the Giyani Municipality amounting to R40 million. Today, the DA filed a complaint with the office of the Public Protector to probe Giyani Local Municipality unauthorized expenditure of over R40 million in the 2016/2017 financial year. The Public Protector needs to investigate this as a matter of urgency. The abuse of state resources cannot be tolerated while the poor in Giyani suffer due to unemployment and a lack of service delivery,&#8221; DA said in a statement. The DA alleges that out of the R40 million, almost half of the money amounting to R20 million incurred as result of unnecessary expenditure while the other half was as a result of unauthorized expenditure which the municipality cannot account too. Furthermore, the DA says that the Municipality has made an R100 million investment in VBS Mutual Bank in March but it has only realized an interest of R2 million in the last four months. Earlier this year the municipality came under fire after settling to pay its former municipal manager R1.6m after he had taken it to court for initially failing to reveal reasons why they could not appoint him after winning interviews twice for the municipal manager job. While money is wasted in this municipality, residents struggle with high rates of unemployment and poor service delivery, said the DA. -TNA Reporter
