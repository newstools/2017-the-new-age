The Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature Portfolio Committee on Education will be embarking on a schools visit programme across the Province.This is an annual programme where all the Members of the Provincial Legislature (MPLs) for eight groups will focus on all district and metro municipalities.Chairperson for the Committee Mxolisi Dimaza said the Committee is there to assess the schools readiness for the 2017 school calendar year and check what problems the schools are faced with and most of all how to turn around the 49,5% dismal pass rate the Lady Frere District received in 2016 .He added We want to check what went wrong in this district as it used to be one of the best performing districts in the province.The province performed worse in the national senior certificate results with a 59.3% pass rate. It recorded a 2.5% increase from 2015 s 56.8% whereas The country s pass rate stood at 72.5% including progressed pupils.Acting Lady Frere District Director Thobeka Zibula shared an overview of the challenges that department is facing saying Out of 174 schools in the district, 86 of them are operating with 5 teachers or less.&#8220;Shortage of teachers for critical subjects such as Maths and Science as some are resigning and Non-delivery of textbooks are some of the challenges said Zibula.Zibula also complained that the Department of Education is employing foreign nationals and give them a contract of three months yet they are good with Maths and Science. This is an administrative nightmare for us resulting in Maths and Science teachers starting late in schools and sometimes towards the end of the year she saidEducation Chief Director Phila Ngqumba says the department is unable to give solutions to the problems alone but says all stakeholders must come together. &#8220;The reason textbooks were not delivered is because orders were only placed in December and we would make sure that there is consequence management as this is unacceptable&#8221; said NgqumbaHe added Scholar transport is indeed a big problem for the department. SGBs and communities have agreed that some schools must be closed down and combined with some but it does not happen because of the non-availability of budget for scholar transport.The Schools visit programme started on the 13th of January 2017 and will continue until the 20th of January 2017.TNA Reporter
