SA federation of Trade Unions (Saftu) members have been urged to stand behind Numsa in the wage negotiations that have reached a stalemate. The engineering sector is in a deadlock following failed negotiations between trade unions and employers last week. Numsa is demanding “a 15% wage increase across the board based on the actual rate that a worker is earning and not on the minimum rate”. The organisation also wants the current agreement to be extended to non-parties and implemented for two years. Numsa has requested a certificate to strike in the engineering sector and expects a decision by the end of the week. Saftu supports Numsa’s rejection of proposals where employers pay the new national minimum rate as opposed to what workers were actually earning. Any union party who referred a dispute may issue notice of strike 30 days after the date of the dispute even if no certificate has been issued. This effectively means the unions may issue a strike notice any time after Monday. Jaco Swart, a National Collective Bargaining Council coordinator said correspondence with Numsa indicates it is unlikely a strike notice will be issued by then. Numsa has blamed the ANC and its national minimum wage policy. The organisation said employers want to implement a minimum rate of R20 a hour for new entrants in the sector, when the minimum is now R40 a hour. -THELMA NGOMA|thelman@thenewage.co.za
