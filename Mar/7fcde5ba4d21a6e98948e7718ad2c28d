Minister of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa has on Thursday condemned the Pretoria rental estate agent who listed a whites only advert. Mthethwa said there is no place for racism in South Africa and if people work together, it can be defeated. We reiterate our call to all citizens to unite and fight racism. If we work together, we can defeat this atrocious ideology.&#8221; Dick and Sue Home Finders on the Private Property website on Tuesday posted an advert that specified that &#8220;only whites&#8221; may apply for a townhouse at La Montagne. It is reported that estate agent, Elize Scheun was listed on the advert as the contact person, however Scheun claims she had nothing to do with it. Mthethwa added that they take exception to the lukewarm and condescending response provided by Dick and Sue Home Finders who shifted the blame and showed little remorse. &#8220;We denounce this racist &#8220;whites-only&#8221; advert placed by Dick and Sue Home Finders on the Private Property website. It&#8217;s dreadful and intolerable.&#8221; We denounce this racist &#8220;whites-only&#8221; advert placed by Dick &amp; Sue Home Finders on the Private Property website.
