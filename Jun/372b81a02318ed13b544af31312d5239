President Donald Trump on Thursday launched a brutal personal attack on MSNBC journalist Mika Brzezinski, after she sharply criticized his administration&#8217;s dysfunction in a segment on her show.&#8220;I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don&#8217;t watch anymore),&#8221; Trump wrote, referring to a morning news show featuring Brzezinski and co-host Joe Scarborough.&#8220;Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year&#8217;s Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!&#8221; Trump tweeted.The president, an avid cable news watcher, appears to have been responding to sharp comments by Brzezinski during Thursday &#8220;Morning Joe&#8221; program on the left-leaning MSNBC cable network.&#8220;Everybody in Washington,&#8221; Brzezinski said, &#8220;in the administration, needs to look at this from&#8230; a point of view where they&#8217;re not lobotomized because you&#8217;re sitting in there and you&#8217;re so scared of him, and you think you need to suck up to the president.&#8221;If a boss at NBC &#8212; MSNBC&#8217;s parent company &#8212; &#8220;started tweeting wildly about people&#8217;s appearances, bullying people, talking about people in the competition, lying every day, undermining his managers, throwing them under the (bus) &#8212; that person would be thrown out.&#8220;It&#8217;s just not normal behavior,&#8221; she said. &#8220;In fact, there would be concerns that the person who runs the company is out of his mind.&#8221;Brzezinski appeared to be uncowed by Trump&#8217;s Twitter attack. She responded to his tweet with a post of her own, a photo of a young child reaching for Cheerios cereal.&#8220;Made for little hands,&#8221; the picture caption read &#8212; a schoolyard taunt that has been leveled against the image-conscious Trump since the days of his candidacy.Scarborough re-tweeted a comment from CNN reporter Jake Tapper: &#8220;This reminds me: how is @FLOTUS&#8217;s campaign against cyber-bullying going?&#8221; it said, referring to First Lady Melania Trump.Trump was often interviewed on &#8220;Morning Joe&#8221; during the 2016 presidential campaign, but as the White House relationship with much of the US media has soured he has recently favored interviews with friendly right-wing outlets.Brzezinski, 50, is the daughter of the late Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was president Jimmy Carter&#8217;s national security advisor.Scarborough, 54, is a Republican former congressman who represented a Florida district in the 1990s.The two are engaged to marry.-AFP
