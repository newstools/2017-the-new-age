IT IS not hard to believe in possibilities when a national team like the Springbok Sevens promise to go for broke in three tournaments in one year. Their quality, fighting spirit and talent that transcends racial barriers is always enough to get fans behind them. And when the Blitzbokke coach Neil Powell said his team will challenge for the World Rugby Sevens Series, Commonwealth Games and Rugby Sevens World Cup in the next year, all one can do is look forward to a blockbuster year. The process will be kicked off by their first games today in Dubai as they gun to defend their World Rugby Sevens Series. As it is, world class players like Seabelo Senatla, Justin Geduld, Rosko Specman, Cecil Afrika and Werner Kok are all fired up to highlight the point made by Powell. “We are aiming to be successful in all three. Each of those tournaments will have unique challenges, so we will have to treat them on their merits. It all starts in Dubai today and we must focus on the first things first,” Powell said. “It is a long season and we have planned accordingly. We will be looking to rotate players this year in order to keep everyone fresh for each of those challenges.” While dominating on all fronts is something the all conquering Blitzbokke are aiming to do, getting sides like Uganda and Kenya out of the way today in Dubai is far more important. The opening match against Uganda kicks off this morning at 8.52am, following by another against Kenya at 12.26pm, with the final pool game against Canada at 7.53pm. “A strong start here will give us confidence and momentum going into our home tournament in Cape Town next weekend, so we will be looking to build a solid foundation. It will be a bonus if we achieve the results, but the focus will be on the way we play and execute.” mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
