DESPITE not being available for Amajita s previous camp, Bidvest Wits star Phakamani Mahlambi has made it into the South African 2017 U-20 Afcon squad. A month ago, Mahlambi was named by coach Thabo Senong in his 31 man squad to prepare for the tournament which will be played in Zambia from Sunday.However, Wits didn t release the player, raising concern about the star s availability for the tournament. The tournament falls out of the Fifa calendar and clubs are therefore not obliged to release the players to junior national teams. Wits are on a mission to win their first Absa Premiership title and Mahlambi is one of their key players. Coach Senong s squad has two international players, Liam Jordan and Luther Singh, who both ply their trade in Portugal.sithembisod@thenewage.co.za-Sithembiso Dindi
