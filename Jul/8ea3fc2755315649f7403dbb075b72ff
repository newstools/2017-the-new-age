Ranks and routes in Soweto plagued by taxi wars may be closed for at least a month the MEC of transport Ismail Vadi has said.Vadi published a notice indicating his intention to stop road transport services in the affected routes.The Nancefield-Dube West Taxi Association (Nanduwe) and the Witwatersrand African Taxi Association (Wata) has been involved in violent conflicts over routes for months. The simmering tensions have sometimes resulted in deaths.Vadi said the legal action follows the failure by the two associations to resolve the stand-off despite efforts to find a solution.He said the measure would also apply to any joint venture arrangements entered into by the affected associations.The dispute was formally heard by the Provincial Regulatory Entity and a ruling was last month made that Wata had irregularly encroached on the routes registered in the name of Nanduwe.However, Vadi said, the implementation of the ruling of the Provincial Regulatory Entity had not helped to stabilise transport operations in the area. The provincial government cannot tolerate a situation where alleged hitmen have been hired to attack taxi drivers, commuters and taxi operators with impunity, Vadi said. Our communities are being intimidated by criminal thugs who have infiltrated the taxi industry. I have discussed this matter with my legislature colleague, MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane and we are clear that the law enforcement agencies will come down hard on those who perpetrate acts of violence in the taxi industry. Interested parties have been called to make written submissions on the matter and depending on the outcomes of the submissions the routes may be closed for the next month.According to the provincial transport department, the MEC is expected to make his official announcement by next week.Last month the two associations clashed over early morning pick-up points in Mofolo, Orlando West and Central Western Jabavu.In April this year, three taxi owners were gunned down, while a taxi driver and a passerby were injured. The three who died were affiliated to Wata.Taxi violence in Gauteng left six people dead and several more people injured in that month.In December last year, the South Gauteng High Court ruled in favour of Nanduwe following Wata s application to have its rivals removed from the operation. Another ruling was made in March this following Nanduwe s application for an interdict.The association accused Wata of ignoring the previous order.The court ruled that Wata should stop intimidating, assaulting, threatening and blocking Nanduwe from operating, but said that the order was not to determine the rightful operator of the route.LILLIAN SELAPISAlillians@thenewage.co.za
