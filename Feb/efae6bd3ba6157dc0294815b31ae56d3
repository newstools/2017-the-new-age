Although rhino poaching has decreased in terms of numbers, the South African National Parks (SANParks) has complained that poaching is still a problem as it drains resources meant for conservation.Spokesperson for SANParks Ike Phaahla said poaching, especially at the Kruger Park is a big problem adding that they have had to retain rangers, employed new technologies and K9 dogs and have recruited pilots who assist them to arrest poachers.Phaahla said the proximity of the Kruger Park to the Mozambican border also made the fight against poaching difficult because their mandate stays within the park, but cooperation between the two countries has improved and law-enforcement agencies, private reserves and the communities now work together.He said because of the joint forces working together, there had been an increase in the number of arrests and the number of confiscated rifles and ammunition.Rhino poaching was made a national priority crime in 2014 and an integrated strategic management approach that has key pillars including compulsory interventions managing the rhino population, sustainability and new interventions within the context of regional and international cooperation, was adopted.The Minister of Environmental Affairs said there was a decline in poaching at Kruger National Park.In 2016 between January and August a total of 485 poached rhino carcasses were found at Kruger Park, compared to 557 in 2015, a 17.8% decrease.There was also a decrease of 5% to 25% in the number of black rhinos poached, so the continued collaboration through a joint management committee between South Africa and Mozambique seems to be working.The cooperation between the two countries has already yielded successful cross border anti-poaching operations with the Mozambican special Police Unit for Natural Resource and Environment Protection. However, a major concern of the Environmental Affairs Department was the beginning of a rise in elephant poaching despite the vigorous and determined efforts of the rangers as well as police and soldiers to curb such activities.Since January last year 36 elephants have been poached in the Kruger National Park.HLONI MASHIGOprovinces@thenewage.co.za
