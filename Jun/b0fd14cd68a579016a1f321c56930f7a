International Relations and Cooperation Minister Maite Nkoana Mashabane will lead a South African delegation to the 29th African Union (AU) summit in Addis Ababa next week.Nkoana-Mashabane will represent President Jacob Zuma at the summit on July 3 and 4. The Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Maite Nkoana Mashabane, in her capacity as special representative of President Jacob Zuma, will lead South Africa s delegation to the 29th session of the assembly of heads of state and government of the African Union, Dirco confirmed on Tuesday.Although no reason has been given for the minister representing President Zuma at the summit, the reason might be that the AU summit clashes with the ANC s crucial national policy conference, starting tomorrow and ending on Wednesday, July 5.The AU summit will take place under the theme Harnessing the demographic dividend through investments in the youth , which is of crucial importance to South Africa and the continent. The South African government has prioritised youth development and empowerment with the primary objective of ensuring their fullest integration into society so as to ensure that they take charge of their lives and realise their full potential, the international relations department said.This is within the context of domesticating the AU s Agenda 2063 through the National Development Plan 2030 and the National Youth Policy 2020.The summit is also expected to deliberate on key issues related to the implementation of institutional reforms of the pan-African bloc, peace and security, and addressing issues related to migration, among others.The situations in South Sudan, Libya, Mali, Central African Republic, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, the region of Darfur and Somalia are expected to be the hot issues as far as peace and security on the continent is concerned.The leaders will also reflect on the issue of the early establishment of the Continental Free Trade Area as an essential instrument to promote intra-African trade and continental integration.Other important agenda items include matters like the adoption of the 2018 budget of the AU and various elections, including for the remaining two positions of commissioner for human resources, science and technology, and commissioner for economic affairs.TNA REPORTERnews@thenewage.co.za
