Gauteng &#8217;s department of Human Settlement s has on Tuesday said they have no budget for Eldoraldo park housing development in the current fiscal year.The departmental spokesperson Keith Khoza, says when the department plan about housing, they plan on areas where land is available. Khoza blamed the current protest the DA and other parties for fuelling the situation and promising people unrealistic promises. We cannot promise people houses on land that has not been approved. We also cannot promise people house when the budget has not been set aside, then will be making unrealistic promise, he said.The departmental spokesperson caution ed political parties to be restrain ed , adding that they should not raise fa lse expectation of the people and make promises they can t deliver.Khoza made reference to the promise Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba had made, saying Mashaba made promises on the land that did not even belong to the city.However, Eldorado-park community leader Ayob Mu ngalee, disagreed with Khoza, saying he was in a meeting with Gauteng Premier David Makhura were he promised the community houses. Mu ngalee said the promises in the area dates back to 1994, and since then there was still no houses. He accused politicians of playing blame game at the expense of the people.He revealed that people, who were given land, were people who did not come from Eldorado Park, but outside, adding that the natural residents still lived in the backyards of their homes. The natural people born in Eldarado still s its in the families back yard. You can find back yard shack with six seven people living in it and that is unacceptable, he said. Mu ngalee further said they have been on waiting list since 1994 and that they were still on the list.-Sipho Jack
