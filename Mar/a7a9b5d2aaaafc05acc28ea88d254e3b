The Minister of Sports and Recreation Fikile Mbalula said R4.56 billion approved by government was sufficient to host the Commonwealth Games. Mbalula was speaking at a media conference on Tuesday after the country lost the bid to host the Commonwealth Games in 2022, which was supposed to be hosted in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal.Commonwealth Federation issued a statement which states: It is with disappointment that the detailed review has concluded that there is a significant departure from the undertakings provided in Durban s bid and as a result a number of key obligations and commitments in areas such as governance, venues, funding and risk management. Reports that the City failed to host the games due to shortcomings on its side, like failing to assemble a local organizing committee and failing to pay the host city amount that was due to them, were lambasted by the Minister.The Minister said when Durban was announced the host city, they had not signed the agreement as there were parts they did not agree on. Clauses in the agreement were seriously going to compromise South Africa and the government was not prepared to sign an open ended guarantee&#8230; The Minister reiterated that South Africa did not want to host the games at all cost.&#8220;We cannot make the country bankrupt with Commonwealth Games, Mbalula said.The country was expected to spend over R6 billion in order to host the games. R118m has been spent in the bid to host the Commonwealth Games in Durban in 2022.Meanwhile the federation has stated that it will be looking for a replacement as Durban was the only remaining city bidding. In line with the mandate from members at the 2016 General Assembly, the CGF is actively exploring alternative options, including a potential replacement host,&#8221; the federation said.The Minister said he believes that there was no ulterior motive but however the federation wanted to bring the games to Africa and make money and they could not meet each other in those terms. This could have been the first time the common wealth games were hosted in Africa. Mbalula said however that this does not hinder the country&#8217;s chances to bid for other bigger tournaments in future. They will continue bidding for other events like the Rugby World Cup.&#8211;vutomi shiluvane
