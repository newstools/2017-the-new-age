PARENTS have been warned to avoid unregistered initiation schools for their sons, ahead of the inception period next week. Just last month, three female initiates died at Moteti village and four initiates, aged between 14 and 21, died after complications at initiation schools in KwaMhlanga, Kwaggafontein, Vosman and Belfast, Mpumalanga.About 251 young males died between 2014 and last month at initiation schools in eight provinces, the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities said yesterday.The statistics said 557 deaths were reported between 2006 and 2014, bringing the total to 774. Gauteng s cooperative governance and traditional affairs MEC, Paul Mashatile, and iNkosi Mahlangu of the Amandebele Ndzundza Sokhulumi and Kgosi Kekana of the Amandebele Ba Lebelo Traditional Communities encouraged parents to ensure that the initiation schools where they had enrolled their children were properly registered with their municipality and complied with the relevant municipal by-laws.Initiation is a cultural ritual practised by many traditional communities across the world. This year s initiation period is scheduled to start on Thursday, June 29.In South Africa, male initiation has been practised for many years and the government is obliged to support the traditional institutions to protect, promote and ensure the preservation of male and female initiation in line with the practices and customs of traditional communities. We are aware of dubious and criminal elements taking advantage of this cultural practice, Mashatile said. In instances where unregistered initiation schools were identified, the children attending such schools must be regarded as abducted and relevant legislation must be enforced to bring those unscrupulous elements to book. He said in order to curb this, both national and provincial governments had put measures in place to ensure effective implementation of the National Policy on the Customary Practice of Initiation in South Africa. Gauteng initiation schools shall operate under a determined set of rules and conditions. The conditions are aligned to the approved National Policy on the Customary Practice of Initiation in South Africa and other related legislation, Mashatile said.He called on society to work together to ensure the safety of young people was not compromised and criminals were prevented from taking advantage of this important cultural practice.Mashatile also urged municipalities to enforce the by-laws without fear or favour and for law enforcement agencies to act firmly against those breaking the law in exploitation of this cultural practice .Members of the public may use a hotline number created to report any irregularities, operation or existence of illegal initiation schools and all wrongdoings in the name of the practice. The hotline number is 0800 111166.NTOMBI NKOSI ntombin@thenewage.co.za
