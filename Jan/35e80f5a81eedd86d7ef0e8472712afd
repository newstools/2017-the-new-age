Former public protector Thuli Madonsela will kick off South Africa s oldest press club s An Alternative State of the Nation series of talks in Cape Town today.To be held at Kelvin Grove, a venue in Newlands, that has for decades been associated with colonialism and for being a private members club, the event is hosted by the Cape Town Press Club.A number of talks under the banner An Alternative State of the Nation, has been organised and will be held until President Jacob Zuma delivers the real thing next month.Despite having cleared her office last October, Madonsela remains an eminent newsmaker.Her status in this regard was enhanced last week with the leaking and subsequent publication of a report into one of apartheid South Africa s top four banks, Bankorp.That report, apparently, led to her successor, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, recommending that the Reserve Bank recover billions of rands from Absa, which purchased Bankorp in 1992.Mkhwebane also, reportedly, recommended that President Jacob Zuma initiate an investigation of inquiry into the disappearance of billions of rands into the coffers of South African companies.Today, Madonsela will make her first public appearance since these reports first appeared. She is due to reflect on her seven years in the office of public protector.The press club said: For millions of South Africans, Madonsela became a beacon of hope, a bulwark against corruption and a defender of the Constitution. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will lead a South African delegation, which includes a batch of cabinet ministers to the four-day World Economic Forum (WEF) due to start in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland tomorrow.Zuma was to have led the group, but in an unexplained move, the presidency has announced that Ramaphosa will head the delegation.The presidency said the annual meeting of the WEF brings together world leaders from business, government, international organisations, academia and civil society to discuss the global economy. This year 2 700 delegates are expected to attend.South Africa will once again use the opportunity to market the country as being open for business and partnerships for development in various sessions and interactions with global business.Ramaphosa s team includes Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, the Minister for Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation, Jeff Radebe, Trade and Industry Minister Rob Davies, Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel, and Water Affairs Minister Nomvula Mokonyane.The ad hoc committee on the SABC board has completed its programme to interview witnesses, but has asked people who want to give evidence to submit affidavits for considerations.Committee chairperson Vincent Smith said in a statement: The committee drafted and adopted a programme according to who was available and could not go back and amend its programme at this late stage.There is nothing stopping anyone from submitting an affidavit for the committee s attention. news@thenewage.co.za
