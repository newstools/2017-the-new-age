Gauteng MEC for Roads and Transport Ismail Vadi on Thursday announced that the department has suspended the licenses of 24 private and public Vehicle Testing Stations (VTS) in the province.&#8220;The 24 testing stations failed to comply with relevant regulations relating to the installation of play detectors and wheel mass meters capable of being linked to brake testers.Such administrative action was necessary to improve road safety and to ensure that tested vehicles are in roadworthy condition,&#8221; he said.Vadi added that the testing equipment is also necessary to calculate brake requirements on vehicles and provide a printed report.The following stations have been suspended:Global Clearwater, Global Mayfair, Motorcity, Booysens, Orlando, Global Martindale, Global Vereeniging, Kenmare 2, Gauteng, Global Autocity, River Park, Global Edenvale, Roete 23, VTS SA PTA West, Global Randburg, Meyerton, Vereeniging, Vanderbijlpark, Sandton, Randburg, Waltloo, Carletonville, Centurion and Heidelberg.The Department had initially identified 46 non-compliant Vehicle Test Stations that were suppose to be suspended.However, after conducting inspections, 24 stations have received suspension notices.Vadi indicated that the Department will be willing to lift the suspensions once the said Vehicle Testing Stations can prove that the required equipment has been installed.The Department also announced that it will soon embark on Phase 2 of its operations, which will involve Provincial Monitors conducting physical verification of another 52 of the registered Vehicle Testing Stations in the province.This implies that additional non-complying Vehicle Testing Stations may be suspended in future.-TNA Reporter
