Irish rockers U2 said on Monday they would mark the 30 th anniversary of their hit album &#8220;The Joshua Tree &#8221; by playing it in full on a European and North American tour .The 1987 album sold more than 25 million copies worldwide, and topped charts with its hits &#8220;With Or Without You&#8221;, &#8220;Where The Stree ts Have No Name&#8221; and &#8220;I Still Haven&#8217;t Found What I&#8217;m Looking For&#8221;.&#8220;Recently I listened back to &#8216;The Joshua Tree &#8216; for the first time in nearly 30 years &#8230; it&#8217;s quite an opera. A lot of emotions which feel strangely current, love, loss, broken dreams, seeking oblivion, polarisation &#8230; all the greats,&#8221; frontman Bono said in a statement.The north American leg of the tour will kick off in May in Vancouver, followed by a European section starting in London in July and including an appearance back home at Dublin&#8217;s Croke Park stadium.One Republic, Mumford &amp; Sons and The Lumineers will support the band in America, and Noel Gallagher&#8217;s High Flying Birds in Europe.-Reuters
