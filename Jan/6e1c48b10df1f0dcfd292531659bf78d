Well, if you&#8217;re wondering what sexual nirvana means, it&#8217;s simply the point of extreme sexual satisfaction and/or gratification which leaves you unable to react and express yourself. And, here are 5 ways you could attain the same.Go dancing together Chances are mundanity and distance have taken over your relationship and to get rid of this friction, it&#8217;s time to dance away the blues. Just turn on some romantic music and dance, till the two of you are totally into each other. Dancing flushes the human system with dopamine, which means you feel happier and the happiness is further carried to the bedroom.Get touchy No one can deny the fact that there isn&#8217;t a greater thing than a sensual touch or a massage for a couple to get back to each other. A sensual touch of your loved one can unlock your body of sexual tensions and result in some serious orgasms.Indulge in role play Sex isn&#8217;t a daily chore and shouldn&#8217;t be treated like one. Catch the train to fantasy land and indulge in role plays. Choose a wild role for yourself and a wilder one for your lover. Let imagination take over and enjoy the heat between the sheets.Strip and play When was the last time you mixed sex with play? Well, if it&#8217;s been ages, then it&#8217;s time to let the game begin. Strip poker is the best way to go naked in front of your lover and what&#8217;ll follow is something we don&#8217;t need to tell you.Try a new position If you have been stuck on the missionary position since ages it&#8217;s time to experiment. Get out of your comfort zone and try something new. We recommend the &#8216;X position&#8217; or the crisscross. The position requires you to lie back and have your lover sit facing you, with your legs crossing over each other to form an X. Hold his hands and enjoy the journey!This article first appeared on The Times of India
