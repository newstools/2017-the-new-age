South African Airways (SAA) was yesterday ordered by the South Gauteng High Court to pay local rival Comair R1.16bn for anti-competitive behaviour.SAA commented yesterday that it had taken note of the judgment, which involved a 12-year-old matter.The state-owned carrier s spokesperson, Tlali Tlali, said the airline would study the judgment. It is important to note that this is one of the legacy matters, dating back to the period 1999 to 2005 and implemented by the then management team. All of those managers left the company a while back and new business management processes were since introduced to ensure compliance with all relevant prescripts. He said the current management was focused on turning the business around to ensure that SAA was commercially viable, operationally competitive and financially self-reliant in the shortest time possible. The airline will not debate any merits of the case in the media, Tlali said.The judgment related to a case initiated by Comair against SAA 14 years ago in respect of SAA s anti-competitive travel agent incentive schemes.Comair is the second airline to succeed in a claim against SAA concerning the national airline s anti-competitive conduct.The cases arise from SAA s agreements with travel agents from 2001 whereby SAA paid them to divert customers to SAA rather than other airlines. Last year the court ruled in favour of Nationwide awarding it R104m. Comair said the judgment was subject to appeal by both parties.SELLO RABOTHATA |sellor@thenewage.co.za
