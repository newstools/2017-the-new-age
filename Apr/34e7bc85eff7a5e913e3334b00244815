Democratic Republic of Congo&#8217;s President Joseph Kabila on Wednesday pledged to appoint a new prime minister in the next two days, in line with a stalled December peace deal struck with the opposition.&#8220;The prime minister will absolutely have to be named within 48 hours,&#8221; Kabila said in amuch-awaited speech to MPs and senators on the state of a December 31 power-sharing agreement, yet to be implemented.The deal brokered by the influential Catholic church aimed to avoid a full-blown crisis in the vast restive nation following Kabila&#8217;s failure to step down at the end of his second and final mandate mid-December.It enabled Kabila to remain in office pending elections in late 2017 in tandem with a transitional body and a new premier, to be chosen within opposition ranks.But putting the deal in place hit a major hurdle in early February with the death of veteran opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi, who had gathered together the opposition in a coalition called &#8220;Assemblement.&#8221;In his speech in the capital, Kinshasa, Kabila urged the opposition group &#8220;to overcome its internal squabbles&#8221; and to hand him a list of candidates for the post of prime minister.Kabila has run one of the world&#8217;s least developed countries since the 2001 assassination of his father Laurent.Violence has flared across the country of 71 million people in recent months however, amid fears of a continued delay in this year&#8217;s promised elections.-AFP
