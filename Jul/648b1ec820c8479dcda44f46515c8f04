RADICAL economic transformation should go beyond being a clich and should be accelerated so that the economy could benefit all South Africans.Small Business Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu made the comments at the Progressive Business Forum on day three of the ANC policy conference at Nasrec, Johannesburg yesterday. We need to change things and do things faster because I don t think black people are going to take kindly to a process that s taking too long, Zulu said.She said it was time for Black Economic Empowerment to materialise for the benefit of all and warned that radical economic transformation would by no means be achieved overnight. It is something we need to work towards and keep on polishing the strategies that we have in place and keep on sharpening our plans towards its implementation. Zulu said her department aims at growing small businesses so that these could be scaled up to formal and mainstream businesses. Speaking at the same event, ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize said the need for a black bank was now a matter of urgency. We have been calling now, increasingly, for the creation of a black bank which must actually cater for the needs of the small businesses which are getting neglected by the big banks, Mkhize said.MTHOKOZISI DUBE mtokozisid@thenewage.co.za
