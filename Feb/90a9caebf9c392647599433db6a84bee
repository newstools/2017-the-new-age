The bells of change for Gauteng s Talk radio station, Power FM rang much earlier than expected this year with yesterday s announcement of its 2017 on-air line-up.The changes include the introduction of new voices to the station and moving familiar ones into new time slots. Destiny Magazine editor, Thabiso TT Tema who has been the host of Power Drive since its inception will now become the sole man in charge of the station s breakfast show weekdays from 6am to 9am.But it is perhaps the moving of veteran broadcaster, Lawrence Thlabane, who hosted the station s breakfast show after taking over from Tim Modise in 2016, will now become the station s stand-in broadcaster instead of a daily staffer. Thabo Mdluli, who joined the station as a music presenter and later moved to the midnight talk show Power Zone, will take over Power Drive, weekdays from 3pm to 5pm.SABC sportscaster, Kwena Moabelo will present Power Zone, previously hosted by Thabo Mdluli from midnight to 3am is another big name announced by the station. In a statement the station said it was refreshing its on-air line-up as it enters its fourth year of broadcasting. The changes are a reflection of the evolving needs of the station s growing audience. We welcome the new voices to the station and thank all talent who have contributed to our growth, the station s head of programming Ferdinand Mabalane said.
