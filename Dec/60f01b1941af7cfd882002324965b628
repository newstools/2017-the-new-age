Two suspects arrested for allegedly following travellers from the OR Tambo International Airport are in police custody while another accomplice has been shot dead during a shootout with police.  The suspects were arrested on Sunday following a clash with the police which led to one of the criminals shot dead. “The team followed up on the intelligence and spotted the Mercedes traveling from the airport. Attempts to have the suspect vehicle stop led to a shootout on the N3 near the Marlborough off-ramp, Johannesburg.  “One male suspect was shot dead and two men were arrested. The police also recovered two unlicensed firearms. The Mercedes ML which the suspects were using was reported to have been hijacked in the Norwood area in October this year,” Police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said. He said that the suspects are likely to face charges of unlawful possession of firearms, ammunition, armed robbery (iro of the hijacked Mercedes) and murder (iro of their dead accomplice). “We believe that they could be linked to other similar incidences of the airport following robberies. “This is a significant breakthrough to our efforts to combat crimes in and around the OR Tambo International Airport, especially the crimes where people are being followed from the airport and being robbed,” Naidoo said. The two suspects are expected to appear either at the Kempton Park Magistrates Court or Alexander Magistrates court on Tuesday. -TNA Reporter
