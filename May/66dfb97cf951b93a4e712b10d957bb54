The United States of America Cricket Association (USACA) faces expulsion from the International Cricket Council (ICC) in June, the sport&#8217;s global governing body said on Monday.USACA was suspended in 2015 with several reinstatement conditions after the ICC found that the organisation did not have widespread authority over the country&#8217;s cricket activities and lacked unity.The ICC said USACA had failed to work with succesfully with a group set up to help them rectify the position and had breached several other reinstatement conditions.&#8221;Our focus throughout this two year process has been on the unification of the USA cricket community behind USACA to grow and develop the sport,&#8221; ICC Chief Executive David Richardson said in statement on Monday.&#8220;USACA&#8217;s refusal to engage in the process &#8230; its apparent failure to put the ICC Board-approved constitution before its members without legitimate excuse undermines the all-important objective of uniting the sport.&#8221;A resolution to expel USACA will be voted on at a meeting of the ICC Full Council in June.-Reuters
