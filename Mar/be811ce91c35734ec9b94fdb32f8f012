Up to 193 school children fell pregnant in Grades 3, 4 and 5 between 2014 and 2016.DA Member of the Portfolio Committee on Basic Education Sonja Boshoff said the party would urgently submit further parliamentary questions to find out if these girls were under the age of 16 and if so, whether any charges had been instituted against those responsible because this would be considered statutory rape.The statistics were supplied in response to a DA parliamentary question.&#8220;If school children from Grade 6 and 7 who fell pregnant are added, this number increases to 1 449 children&#8221; said Boshoff This information should shock every South African. Young girls, most under the legal age of 16, are having their futures undermined, likely through being taken advantage of or abused, she saidThe DA also said that they would also investigate whether these girls have since returned back to school following the birth of their children, and what support the school and the Department of Basic Education have provided them to catch up on the syllabus. It also wanted to know whether counselling and other emotional support has been provided.&#8220;The parliamentary reply showed that 18 357 pupils fell pregnant in 2014, 15 504 in 2015, and 8 732 in 2016,&#8221; said BoshoffMeanwhile, the Department of Basic Education was not able to provide the statistics for Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal.&#8220;Traditionally, these two provinces account for large numbers of school pregnancies, a total of 6 477 in 2014 and 5 178 in 2015 combined,&#8221; said BoshoffTNA Reporter
