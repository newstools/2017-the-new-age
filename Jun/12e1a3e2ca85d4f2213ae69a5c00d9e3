With Russell Domingo s future in doubt even before the Proteas left for the ICC Champions Trophy in , it seems the coach won t even bother to reapply for his position following the team s failure in the tournament.The Proteas, despite being one of the favourites to lift the competition, bombed out early in the group stages following defeats to Pakistan and India. Their only win in the tournament came against Sri Lanka but it was not enough for them to progress to the semifinal. Domingo was told by Cricket South Africa (CSA) to reapply for his position in January after it expires in August following the England tour. Since then, he has not given clarity on whether he will continue in his role as Proteas head coach.But following the Proteas disappointment in the Champions Trophy, it is unlikely that Domingo will continue even if he does reapply Domingo reflected on the four tournaments in which he was in charge, the 2014 and 2016 World T20s, 2015 World Cup and the ongoing Champions Trophy. We ve come so close on so many occasions and it s just disappointing that we didn t give ourselves the best chance, Domingo said. The players are bitterly disappointed, I can tell you it s not through lack of trying or lack of effort or commitment. They have played some great cricket this year and sometimes life can be unfair. But you ve got to make your own luck as well. Domingo will remain with the Proteas in England for the upcoming T20 series and Test matches.Meanwhile, CSA announced AB de Villiers will lead the side in the upcoming T20 series against England with Faf du Plessis, Hashim Amla, JP Duminy, Quinton de Kock and Kagiso Rabada to be rested.Proteas T20 squad: AB de Villiers, Farhaan Behardien, Reeza Hendricks, Imran Tahir, David Miller, Morne Morkel, Chris Morris, Mangaliso Mosehle, Wayne Parnell, Dane Paterson, Andile Phehlukwayo, Dwaine Pretorius, Tabraiz Shamsi, Jon-Jon Smuts.-NEVILLE KHOZA
