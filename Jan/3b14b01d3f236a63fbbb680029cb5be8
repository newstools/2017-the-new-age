Over two dozen people have been killed since the start of the year in clashes pitting the Democratic Republic of Congo&#8217;s security forces against supporters of a slain tribal chief, a local governor said in a statement.&#8220;The death toll since the start of 2017 is 26 people killed including four civilians, nine members of the security forces and 12 militia fighters,&#8221; Kasai-Central provincial governor Alex Kande said in a statement seen by AFP on Wednesday.The wife of one of the militia leaders was also killed, Kande added.The latest casualties add to a soaring toll of at least 140 dead in spiralling clashes in central DR Congo since tribal chief Kamwina Nsapu was killed in mid-August, according to the UN.In a statement last week, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said tens of thousands of civilians were caught in a &#8220;cycle of violence&#8221; in the mineral-rich nation&#8217;s central provinces.&#8220;The situation is worsening by the day,&#8221; it said.In his statement, governor Kande said: &#8220;Kamwina Nsapu&#8217;s movement has morphed in total anarchy into a deadly guerrilla force.&#8221;He accused Kamwina Nsapu&#8217;s supporters of forcibly recruiting minors and of using women and children as human shields in their fight against the government.&#8220;Six AK-47 (rifles) and 14 homemade shotguns have been seized,&#8221; the governor&#8217;s statement said.On Monday, fresh clashes erupted when schools reopened in Kananga, the provincial capital of Kasai-Central, pitting the security forces against Nsapu&#8217;s supporters, who sought to prevent children from attending classes, a local official said on condition of anonymity.After the clash the bodies of three adults, most likely militia fighters, were found in a river, the official added.Kamwina Nsapu was killed in a police operation on August 12 last year, soon after he made his first call for the &#8220;liberation of Congo&#8221; in an audio message that was posted online.DR Congo has for months been mired in a political crisis over President Joseph Kabila&#8217;s refusal to step down.But the vast nation has continued to suffer unrest unrelated to the crisis over Kabila&#8217;s rule, with ethnic and religious clashes raging on in several parts of the country.-AFP
