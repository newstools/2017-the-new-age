A BUDGET of R50m has been allocated to the first phase of the refurbishment of the Phuthaditjhaba Industrial Park in QwaQwa.Minister Rob Davies said the project was part of the department s Revitalisation of the Industrial Parks Programme aimed at revitalising South Africa s state owned industrial parks in order to enable them to contribute to the country s economic growth, attracting investments, job creation and addressing inequality.He said Phuthaditjhaba was one of the five industrial parks for which the Department of Trade and Industry has set aside R216m this year.Davies said his department completed the first phase of the Botshabelo Industrial Park near Bloemfontein at a cost of R24m last year. We identified a need to revitalise state-owned industrial parks located in various parts of the country, mainly the former homelands, as part of efforts to promote industrialisation and manufacturing. The objective of our Revitalisation of Industrial Parks Programme is to upgrade the infrastructure of these parks in order to enable them to contribute in stimulating the country s industrial development, economic growth and job creation, Davies said.He added that the department would like to see parks operating as centres of excellence and beehives of economic activity, contributing to the growth and diversification of the country s economy. The revitalisation process will ensure that the upgraded parks appeal to private investors, provide a conducive environment and attract investments that will create jobs and assist in promoting economic transformation. He continued that the revitalisation programme was implemented in four phases focusing of various areas with the first being the upgrading of security infrastructure. Last year, we spent more than R180m on the first phase of the upgrading of six industrial parks spread across five provinces in the first phase of its revitalisation of the parks programme. The project has provided jobs to many people in their communities, Davies said.BECKER SEMEKA
