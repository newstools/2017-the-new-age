Cape Town City coach Eric Tinkler feels he did not motivate his players enough to see off Maritzburg United on Tuesday after claiming a big win over Kaizer Chiefs a week earlier.City squandered a chance to reclaim top spot by losing 1-0 to Maritzburg at Harry Gwala Stadium A visibly dejected Tinkler felt his players were in holiday mood on Workers Day as they didn t come to the match with the right attitude. Maritzburg, backed by a partisan crowd, claimed maximum points through a brilliantly taken Kurt Leintjies free kick six minutes from full time.Tinkler took responsibility after the loss for failing to inspire his side. It was far from pretty and there are no excuses. We were just not good enough. We didn t put in the performance that we should have. We ve been good the whole year and this is our first loss this year, but I can t really point the finger at any one person, Tinkler said.Collectively we were very, very poor. Tactically, we were poor, at decision making we were poor and it wasn t Maritzburg putting us under pressure. I don t think Maritzburg s shape was good. We just didn t show up. For that, I must take responsibility because the players looked very flat, we didn t look motivated, we panicked every time we got on the ball. The minute we started to press we gave the ball away and that raises questions in my head. Was it too much pressure leading up to this game or did I not motivate them enough knowing that we had come off a good result against Chiefs? I don t think it was a great performance at all. The former Orlando Pirates coach refused to throw in the towel as far as the PSL title is concerned. There s so much that can happen and there are still four games. We re just going to focus now and try to get a good result against Free State Stars. -LINDA XIMBA|news@thenewage.co.za
