SA s top cop s press briefing on the OR Tambo heist left more questions than answers.Acting Police Commissioner Kgomotso Phahlane&#8217;s told the media that they need to be given space in order to investigate Tuesday s multi-million rand foreign currency heist that occurred at OR Tambo International Airport.&#8220;As the South African Police Service, we have viewed the armed robbery and attendant the security breaches in a serious light,&#8221; said Phahlane.#ORTamboHeist Phahlane says our airports are safe. One incident can not define our airports as dangerous spaces @The_New_Age pic.twitter.com/2fvMX8nOuV KellyJones (@kutulloMadisha) March 9, 2017Apart from asking for space and assuring the public of their safety he could not answer any of the burning questions people have in mind &#8211; like, were the security guards armed and did they have the capability to tackle attempted heists of such nature? If they were why did they not retaliate and attempt to arrest or stop the heist in progress. Was there no CCTV footage that was being monitored at a national key point and why were there, not one, but several security breaches including the police, ACSA security and security from the company Brinks Global Services carrying the cash.&#8220;The robbers who came there were armed and they came with one thing in mind, even if these security guys were armed, they would have been overpowered, Phahlane said. Leave for us to do an investigation and provide you with some answers at a certain point of time. #ORTamboHeist Criminals be warned: The City of Johannesburg will not tolerate crime in our City #JoburgAntiCrime #CrimeMustFall ^GZ pic.twitter.com/W2rQpF4hEW City of Joburg (@CityofJoburgZA) March 9, 2017 The question also remains: Who opened the North Gate for the robbers and was authorisation checked?It is believed that the robbers used Airports Company South Africa (ACSA) identity cards which gave them access to the airport s supposedly highly secure cargo area.&#8220;The process of the investigation is underway which includes interviewing all role players and personnel charged with duties in and around the airport.&#8220;We can assure our communities and visitors to our country that we are doing everything possible to ensure that the robbery and all circumstances surrounding the incident form the subject of an intensive, multi-disciplinary investigation,&#8221; he said.According to reports the heist occurred when a police van flashing lights stopped GuardForce personnel as they approached the aircraft that was bound for London on Tuesday night.In 22 minutes from entry to exit the armed gang went for specific boxes at the cargo where high value and high risk cash is stored, it was clear that they knew what they were searching for as they went for certain number of boxes that the robbers were assigned to look for and grab. #ORTamboHeist Maseko, talking about how ACSA deals with crime at ORT @The_New_Age pic.twitter.com/ckQwHyNa8i KellyJones (@kutulloMadisha) March 9, 2017 It was clear that this was a well-planned and executed operation where the undisclosed number of robbers knew how to get into the airport, how to get out and which exits to use.Phahlane said the vehicles for the crime were found in Mamelodi with bogus police branding and the suspects were dressed in blue bogus policemen uniform.&#8220;We have embarked on a process of investigation to identify security shortcomings. If police equipment and uniform was used we will investigate that.&#8221;Phahlane added that journalists were seen at the cargo side, and at the international terminals referring to ANN7 journalists reporting on the story on Wednesday. This, he said, was considered to be restricted areas of the airport.&#8220;There is always visible policing at the terminals. Police are conducting their duties as normal. #ORTamboHeist Phahlane: We have viewed armed robbery which occurred on Tuesday night. It was a security breach in serious line. @ANN7tv&mdash; Kalden O Lachungpa (@KaldenOngmu) March 9, 2017He encouraged travellers and users of the airport to continue to have faith in its security.&#8220;There is no reason to lose faith in the airport security, Security at the air sight has been heightened and would be impossible for them to have entered, This was well-planned it is not something that was thought over night,&#8221; he said.ACSA chief executive officer, Bongani Maseko said a certain level of security was provided by the company but he passed the buck for the security breach saying that cargo should have their own adequate security.&#8220;SAPS, ACSA can&#8217;t be solely responsible for security, Cargo Operators must also take some responsibility,&#8221; Maseko said.Phahlane said while the incident is regrettable and unfortunate, the South African Police Service and all role players are compelled to continuously review the security measures aimed at curbing the recurrence of incidents of this nature. Other unanswered questions:Were biometrics of men posing as cops checked before granted entry or were they carrying air flight access cards?Is there no mechanism for ambushed security to raise an alarm in a situation like this?Was there no other security presence in the entire area where the robbers operated with impunity and without being challenged?Is this not worrying that robbers created havoc inside a national key point without being noticed or stopped for full 22 minutes?How many insiders if any have been rounded up are being suspected of involvement in this heist?Mandisa Magwaza
