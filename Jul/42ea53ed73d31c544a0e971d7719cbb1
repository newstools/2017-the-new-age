As the former South African National Defence Force (SANDF) member Petrus Ndaba returns to the Pretoria Magistrate s Court for his bail application on Wednesday, it has emerged that the alleged conman gatecrashed a function attended by King Goodwill Zwelithini in Soweto in March.The monarch was attending a function to mark the 41st commemoration of the King Zwelithini schools in Emdeni, Soweto.Ndaba, who managed to chat to the king, had allegedly tried to use the meeting to present his bogus South African veterans group, the Amabutho Royal Defence Force, to the monarch.The group had been posing as an army to be integrated into the SANDF or a recruitment agency for the SANDF.Ndaba allegedly enticed recruits with jobs in the SANDF in return for cash. It emerged that Ndaba apparently tried to strengthen his credentials by appearing to be close to the various kings and royal houses in South Africa.Head of King Goodwill s protection service Col Radebe confirmed that Ndaba attended the Soweto function but distanced the Zulu royal house from him. We met him at the school. We were also surprised when he and his group started performing. He later explained that he was a former SANDF member. He tried to arrange a meeting to visit the royal house, but his proposal did not succeed, he said.kutullom@thenewage.co.za
