President Jacob Zuma says the Trans African Locomotive is an African solution for an African problem, developed with African conditions in mind.Zuma made the remarks on Monday while addressing the launch of the locomotive in Koedoespoort, Pretoria.&#8220;Research showed that there was a particular regional demand for a relatively light and efficient locomotive that could ride these tracks, and navigate their twists and turns.&#8220;The engineers responsible for the project have many years experience modifying locomotives to meet unique African conditions.The Trans Africa Locomotive development presented an opportunity to put their great pool of knowledge into practice, and they have done us very proud,&#8221; said Zuma.The Trans African Locomotive is the first ever train that has been designed, engineered and manufactured by Transnet at a cost of R50bn for 1064 (one thousand and sixty four) diesel and electric locomotives.President Zuma attends the official launch of the Trans Africa Locomotive at Koedoesoort, Pretoria (2/2) pic.twitter.com/Msc3JQ29Hx PresidencyZA (@PresidencyZA) April 4, 2017&#8220;The completion of this locomotive is a significant technological achievement by Transnet and the country. We appreciate Transnet s drive to become the leading provider of logistics services in sub-Saharan Africa,&#8221; said Zuma.The majority of the locomotives are built at Transnet&#8217;s Engineering Factory Site in Koedoespoort, Pretoria with some being built in Durban.The complete local manufacturing of a locamotive is great stride. The Gautrain which is the country&#8217;s sole high-speed locamotive was in the manufactured in Derby, in the UK.The first 15 rail cars of the Gautrain were manufactured and assembled in the UK while the remaining 81 rail cars were shipped to South Africa, for assembly in Nigel.Zuma on Tuesday said the trains would be utilised to promote greater trade with other African countries particularly in the SADC region.&#8220;The focus on Africa continues to be a priority, hence the launch of this locomotive today,&#8221; he said.-TNA Reporter
