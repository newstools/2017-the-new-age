A 29-year-old married woman, Susan Smith, diagnosed with moderate depression following the discovery of her husband s prolonged online sex chats with the same partner became a case study for the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), in the US.Their online affair had been going on for 18 months, although she only became aware of it a year later as she becomes increasingly suspicious of the amount of time her husband was spending on the internet.However, when Susan confronted her husband, he denied they were having affair, and was only willing to discontinue the cyber chat. Susan was devastated with her husband s cheating and her depression was made worse by his denial of the issue as infidelity on his part.In the age of the internet, the question into what really constitute cheating has become a thorny issue among couples looking to patch things up after an online cheating scandal.And while Susan s story may sound like something from a romance novel, the question of whether the internet makes infidelity easier has become a harsh reality for many couples who discovered that not only were their significant others reaching out to potential suitors on the internet purely for online sex, but were also meeting face to face for sexual liaisons.It is no wonder the definition of infidelity now includes a romantic and/or sexual relationship with someone other than your spouse, which begins with an online contact and is maintained mainly through electronic conversations that occur through email and chat rooms.Explaining the growing popularity of sex online, romance expert Victoria Scott said: The web serves as a guard of sorts and many people simply seek a confidence boost from a stranger or friend of a friend, she said. However, these interactions often spiral into fantasies, in which both parties can portray themselves as altered versions of themselves, characters that rarely mesh with reality. As long as they never meet, they can keep the charade going indefinitely, he said.In many cases, however these interactions will eventually move past the messaging. Sometimes people in online relationships engage in cyber sex via video chats. Other times they meet face to face and begin a physical affair. But often, they ll avoid meeting in person because a strictly web-based relationship allows them to maintain their fantasies and experience the rush of doing something they know they shouldn t, without the risks (catching an STD, getting caught in the act, or being let down when you meet the other person face to face), Scott said in a blog written for Trustify, a global site described as the Uber for private investigators.While NCBI unreservedly blamed the gradual rise in online infidelity to the widespread use of the internet, meet-up site mybedoryours.com concurred that while the overall rise of infidelity can not be squarely attributed to dating apps and the rise of hookup culture, they aren t blameless either . According to studies 70% of young couples have infidelity in their relationships though every person defines infidelity differently. To add to this, research firm GWI revealed that 42% of Tinder users are already in a relationship or married.With dating apps like Tinder and Bumble becoming the go-to for meeting and mating, even among older adults, cheating rates are rising, with women over 60 who commit infidelity having reportedly gone up from 5% to 15%. Of course, these people aren t cheating because of dating apps, but their wide availability certainly makes it easier than ever to cheat, mybedoryours.com content manager Lucy Wyndham said.TherapyAlthough an additional inquiry with Susan s husband revealed that he was sexually dissatisfied, marital therapy was planned for the couple in the light that underlying problems were present in their marriage prior to theinfidelity. After being encouraged to exercise self-control in his use of the internet during leisure time, Susan s husband finally expressed regret over his behaviour and apologised to her.The next stage of therapy focused on enhancing intimacy between the couple. They were asked to think of joint activities they both enjoyed when they started dating such as scheduling brief weekend vacations and weekly date nights. *Name changed to protect identitytankisok@thenewage.co.za
