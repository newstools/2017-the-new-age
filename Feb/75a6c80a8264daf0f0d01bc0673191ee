The department of transport and public Works (DTPW) recently announced that the R54m expansion project at Red Cross War Memorial Children s Hospital is progressing well.Once completed, the facility will benefit more children. The department said the construction of two paediatric intensive care units (Picus) and ancillary facilities, are expected to be be completed in a few months time. Phase one of the project, which reached completion in August last year, sees final alterations being made.The project was handed to the department who are overseeing the construction by the trust in September 2015.Spokesperson for the DTPW Byron La Hoe, said: As part of Phase one works, which reached practical completion in August 2016, alterations were made to accommodate a 15-bed Picu ward in the C1 wing. Phase two is presently under way and is scheduled for completion in September. This includes fitting out a previously completed ward extension into a new 14-bed Picu ward as well as a 10-bed neonatal high care ward, both in the C2 wing. Once completed, the designed Picu beds, nurse stations and service rooms will make life easier for many and allow for streamlined work.The design has maximised the amount of natural light in the wards and large windows allow staff members to monitor patients at all times. The new facility also encourages the families of children to visit and be part of the healing process.Family facilities have been provided, which includes waiting areas, kitchenettes, parent sleep rooms and counselling rooms.New staff offices in the D floor wing are also under construction to provide space for more intensive care staff to perform the necessary clinical, educational and research duties.La Hoe said: This project would not have been possible without the contributions of the Red Cross Children s Hospital Trust that has funded a number of job opportunities during the project.
