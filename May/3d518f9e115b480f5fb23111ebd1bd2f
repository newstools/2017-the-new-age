THEY are already on the brink of missing out on the lucrative top eight spot and now Orlando Pirates are in danger of dropping further down in the PSL. Defeat against Bloemfontein Celtic in the league tonight could herald a crisis for Kjell Jonevret with his team likely to drop a place to 11th.The Buccaneers visit Celtic at Dr Molemela Stadium tonight looking to curb a two-match winless run and return to the top eight bracket with three league matches left. But should Platinum Stars beat Maritzburg United in the other PSL fixture tonight, Pirates could find themselves back where they ve been recently and closer to the relegation zone.Such a consequence would spell trouble for a team which has shown renewed commitment, with players looking to end what has been a near disastrous season on a high note.Despite their Nedbank Cup title chances, it s the ominous league position which is causing Jonevret sleepless nights. While the likes of Abubbaker Mobara and Ayanda Gcaba have shown complete willingness to die for the Bucs cause, their teammates have appeared to lack the willpower needed for Bucs to end the season in a respectable league position.Celtic, however, will not leapfrog Pirates but victory could move them further from the relegation threat with 29 points. They have a game in hand over Bucs and would draw tons of confidence from a win. Coach Lehlohonolo Seema has already identified the match as a sufficient test of character for his players. With Pirates still theirlicking wounds after their defeat on Sunday, our game will be even more complex, Seema said.kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za-Kgomotso Sethusha
