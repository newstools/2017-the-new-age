The Democratic Alliance (DA) says Acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane, should be immediately suspended following allegations that he has interfered in the investigation against him.An affidavit filed by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) on Thursday alleges that Phahlane lied and was hostile when questioned by investigators about a corruption investigation related to his property, believed to be worth R8-million and refused to answer questions.The affidavit also states that there is a high probability that Phahlane is using his office and authority to undermine the investigation. It further alleges that he has made contact with two of the potential witnesses against him, and has also gained access to a case file listing intended witnesses.&#8220;It is clear that Phahlane will continue to do everything in his power to frustrate the IPID investigation, which must be allowed to continue so that IPID can come to a conclusion as soon as possible,&#8221; said DA Shadow Minister of Police Zakhele Mbhele.IPID will reportedly add charges of defeating the ends of justice, money laundering and racketeering to the investigation against Phahlane.Mbhele on Friday said it was time that SAPS be led by someone who is fit and proper so that the police can focus on bringing down the high crime rate in the country and that Police Minister Fikile Mbalula needs to suspend Phahlane immediately.Phahlane is being investigated for purchasing a house amounting to R8 million, which is suspected to have been received through corrupt activities.Early in the year IPID obtained a warrant to raid the house in the Sable Hills Waterfront Estate.Phahlane went on to serve Private Investigator Paul O Sullivan with an interdict and filed papers in the Pretoria High Court to halt IPID s investigation against him.The acting National commissioner also requested that the courts set aside the warrant to search his home.Head of IPID Robert Mcbride has on a number of occasions stated that Phahlane would be brought to book for his &#8220;corrupt activities.&#8221; We have several statements including bank statements that indicate corruption, money laundering and defeating the ends of justice and it relates to the acting national commissioner of police and some of the service providers to SAPS (South African Police Services), he said while appearing before Parliament s portfolio committee on police.-TNA Reporter
