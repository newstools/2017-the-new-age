DA leader Mmusi Maimane said he and Helen Zille had fundamental differences with regard to the future of the party. He said this as he announced that Zille would be suspended until the outcome of a disciplinary process. It has become quite evident that Helen Zille and I hold fundamentally different attitudes about the mission the Democratic Alliance needs to accomplish in 2019, and the goals and priorities that flow from this, Maimane said. We can work together to rebuild this country the way we want it to be. Clean government, quality education, economic growth, job creation, safety and increased support for those most vulnerable in society. In February Zille tweeted: For those claiming the legacy of colonialism was only negative, think of our independent judiciary, transport, infrastructure, piped water etc. This led to a storm of protests and calls for her resignation. Despite facing a disciplinary action for bringing the party into disrepute, Zille continued to justify her statement saying that her tweet had been misunderstood. Ms Zille s social media commentary and public utterances in connection with colonialism undermine our reconciliation project. There is no question that Ms Zille&#8217;s original tweets and subsequent justifications have damaged our standing in the public mind, Maimane said. We live in a fragile democracy which means our public representatives must, at all times, be sensitive to the legitimate anger that people still feel about our past and its legacy. He said it was up to him as leader to rebuild public trust, and as such had asked the Zille to tender an unreserved apology to SA and the DA for the damage she had done. Unfortunately, she declined, he said. Maimane said that her continued utterances and opinion pieces on the matter had undermined the DA &#8211; and therefore she was suspended. This has not been an easy decision. But, as the Leader, I must do what is right for the party and South Africa, Maimane said.
