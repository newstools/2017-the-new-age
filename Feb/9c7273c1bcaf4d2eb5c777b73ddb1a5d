WESTERN Cape teenager Hjalmar Rall, just 14, will be starting university this year while most of his peers have just started high school.Rall is set to begin his undergraduate studies at the University of Pretoria (UP) on Monday in pursuit of his dreams of becoming a scientist. The top achiever who was home schooled in Riebeek Kasteel will be studying BSc physics. I am very excited, it has been my dream to study physics and I cannot wait to start, he said.I am not really worried about anything. The only thing I will have to get used to is all the people on campus as I come from a small town. My parents have moved up to Pretoria with me so in a way I am at home. Rall s father said letting him stay in residence was no option at his age so they decided to move to Pretoria to support him for a few years.Asked why he chose UP Rall said Pretoria University was the best fit for what he wants to study. The university has also been very helpful and he feels that he will fit in well.His father, Heinrich Rall, said the family was not concerned about their son adapting in university as he had to form social contacts with older people from a very young age. I believe that some children grow up early and prefer a grown-up life, he said. The father said they realised that Rall was gifted from a very young age. He attended a normal school until he finished Grade 5. At that stage it became apparent that the frustration of the slow pace at school was starting to affect his happiness. The only choice open to us was home schooling. What we thought would be a seven-year journey ended up taking just three years. He completed his Cambridge A Levels last year. University was the next logical step. LILLIAN SELAPISA
