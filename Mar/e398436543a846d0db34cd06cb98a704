A 24-YEAR-OLD Thaba Nchu man will spent the rest of his life in jail after he was sentenced for raping a 15-year-old girl in front of her younger siblings. Moeketsi George Ramoeloa was sentenced by the Botshabelo Regional Court last week. The report said in October 2014, Ramoeloa broke into his victim s house in Ratlou by breaking a window. He found his victim sleeping in the house with her siblings. He used the broken window to gain entry. Ramoeloa raped his victim in front of her siblings. Their mother was out for the night and left her three children aged between six and 15. A case of rape was opened for investigation and assigned to then Det-Const Nikiwe Mokatsanyane of Selosesha Family Violence, child protection and sexual offences unit. She collected DNA samples from the victim and sent them to the Forensic Science Laboratory. Results came back in November 2015 and positively linked Ramoeloa, who was serving a term for housebreaking and theft. The detective travelled to Groenpunt prison to charge him with rape. He was sentenced last week. Meanwhile, Thabiso Sebusi and Thabo Rapitsi have been sentenced by the same court to eight years in jail for beating a woman to death. Reports show the deceased, Matshediso Mkhodwane, 31, was drinking at the Jakaranda bus rank shebeen when Rapitsi snatched her necklace. She retaliated by breaking a bottle and demanding her property back. When Rapitsi refused, she stabbed him in the arm. After the victim stabbed Rapitsi, Sebusi, who was at that time sitting and watching, joined in and together they beat Mkhodwane to death. Emergency medical personnel were called to the scene and took the woman to hospital, where she later succumbed to her injuries. The deceased s father reported the incident to the police and a case of murder was opened for investigation and assigned to DetConst Patrick Lenk. The two were sentenced last week.
