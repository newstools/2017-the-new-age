A Malaysian aid convoy has arrived in Myanmar with supplies for ethnic Rakhine civilians and Rohingya Muslims.The Malaysian government sent hundreds of tons of food and other necessities, including clothing and hygiene kits to Myanmar s Yangon region which were then delivered to Rakhine state s capital of Sittwe.Military ships also offloaded supplies in neighbouring Bangladesh which has seen an influx of Rohingya refugees since violence was reignited last year.Myanmar s military has been conducting an ongoing offensive in the northwestern state of Rakhine following attacks on border guard posts in October.According to a report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), cases of sexual violence, extra-judicial killings, torture and enforced disappearances by military and police forces have emerged since the retaliation.The OHCHR said the actions indicated the very likely commission of crimes against humanity . The government of Myanmar has denied the abuse allegations.Approximately 90000 people have since fled the area with an estimated 66000 Rohingya crossing the border into Bangladesh.In its annual report, Amnesty International said that there has been little improvement since the new government, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, took power in 2015 including ongoing conflict and restricted humanitarian access in the country.Myanmar s government reportedly tried to block the Malaysian aid ship, stating that it had not acquired official permission to enter the country.The government later only issued clearance for the port in Yangon, declining Malaysia s application to deliver aid directly to Sittwe and the surrounding townships.It also required that supplies be delivered to both ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and Rohingya in the region.The Malaysian government has been particularly vocal regarding the plight of Rohingya Muslims. In December, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak called on its Asian neighbours and the international community to address the crisis. The world cannot sit by and watch genocide taking place. We must defend them (Rohingya) not just because they are of the same faith but they are humans, their lives have value, Razak said.Violence first erupted in 2012 when Rohingya Muslims clashed with the Buddhist majority. Myanmar s government disputes the Rohingya people s status as Burmese citizens and has enacted discriminatory policies including restrictions on movement and exclusion from healthcare, rendering the majority of the group stateless and impoverished.The UN High Commissioner for Refugees previously described the Rohingya community as one of the most excluded, persecuted and vulnerable communities in the world .Myanmar s government is seeking to investigate the situation in the border state, while the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar is due to present her final report on her recent trip in March.Tharanga YakupitiyageTharanga Yakupitiyage is an IPS correspondent
