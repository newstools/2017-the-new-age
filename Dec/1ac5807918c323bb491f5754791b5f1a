A 27-year-old man will appear in the Athlone Magistrate’s Court on Monday after he handed himself over to the police. The man allegedly fatally shot his girlfriend Unathi Sabsana in front of her parents on Monday and went on the run. “He handed himself over at the Gugulethu police station on Saturday when he realised the police were hot on his heels,” police spokesperson Brigadier Novela Potelwa said. Potelwa said the suspect was wanted on a series of other crimes. He said the police would be opposing the man’s bail application. -TNA Reporter
