Outgoing ANC Secretary Gwede Mantashe says the ANC will be respecting court decisions that went against two PECs and one region yesterday. Mantashe was speaking after the special NEC meeting which discussed several court rulings which went against three PECs. “We don’t want to do anything that will contaminate the conference,” Mantashe said. He said they will, however, be allowed to attend the conference as they have a right to be attending. “They will not be voting on any matter,” he said.   -TNA Reporter
