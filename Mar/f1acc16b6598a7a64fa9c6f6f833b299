The ANC Women&#8217;s League says it notes &#8220;with great contempt&#8221; Western Cape Premier Helen Zille s colonialism tweet.Zille on Thursday tweeted: For those claiming legacy of colonialism was only negative, think of our independent judiciary, transport infrastructure, piped water etc. She later apologised. DA leader Mmusi Maimane admonished her on twitter and later announced she may face disciplinary action for violating the party s social media policy. The ANCWL appeals to the South African public to be aware that the Democratic Alliance (DA) is a wolf clothed in a sheep skin, the statement said.Zille s remarks it commented should be seen as part of the DA s agenda that seeks to remove the democratically elected government that advances equality and replace it with cheerleaders of apartheid and colonialism. -TNA Reporter
