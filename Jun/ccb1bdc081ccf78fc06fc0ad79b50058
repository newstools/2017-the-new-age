His stepping down, the matter of state capture and South Africa s nuclear energy intentions are among the questions waiting to be answered in Parliament by President Jacob Zuma.These three questions are part of a package that members of Parliament have put down for verbal replies from the president in the National Assembly on Thursday.Mandlenkosi Galo, of the African Independent Congress, did not pull punches in his question about whether the head of state had considered resigning.He asked: Whether, with reference to the nationwide protest marches calling for his resignation, the court application for his impeachment that is set to be heard by the Constitutional Court of South Africa and the report of the probe sponsored by the SA Council of Churches entitled Unburdening Panel, which alleges that under his leadership South Africa is on the brink of becoming a mafia state, he intends to step down and allow for other leadership to take the reins? ACDP leader Kenneth Meshoe has asked the president whether he would ensure that allegations of criminality raised in the State of Capture report by the previous public protector Thuli Madonsela, would be expeditiously investigated by the relevant law enforcement agencies.DA leader Mmusi Maimane prefaced his question by noting the contradictions between the government s plans to address future energy needs and public statements made in this regard.His point made, he asks if the government was still intent on pursuing its new nuclear build programme after the Western Cape High Court ruled on April 26, 2017 that all processes and agreements followed to date in the government s pursuit of nuclear power were unlawful and unconstitutional.Fezeka Loliwe has put a friendly question to her party leader. She wants to hear the reasons for the unemployment rate remaining consistent since 1994. She also wants President Zuma to indicate what the government s plans, programmes and initiatives were to address this issue.ANC MP Phuzile Ngwenya-Mabila has asked Zuma to elaborate on the government programmes meant to strengthen engagement with sector stakeholders in delivering radical socio-economic programmes in the rural economy.Hope Malgas, also ANC, has asked for information about the government s White Paper on comprehensive social security which has proposed establishing a national social security fund.DENNIS CRUYWAGENdennisc@thenewage.co.za
