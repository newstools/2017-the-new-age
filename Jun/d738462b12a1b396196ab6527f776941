Former acting national police commissioner Lt-Gen Khomotso Phahlane says he has accepted the decision to suspend him and he does not intend to fight it.Phahlane was last week suspended and replaced by LtGen Joel Mothiba following a probe into his personal affairs by the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid), which has been probing claims of corruption against him.&nbsp;Today the former top cop in a affidavit said he agreed with Police Minister Fikile Mbalula that he should step aside in the interests of the SAPS and the country.&#8220;I enquired from the Minister what my position should be pending the finalisation of the said investigation and the Minister indicated that &#8216;I should stay home&#8217;. I informed him that I also accepted and respected this decision,&#8221; said Phahlane.According to Phahlane he was later served with a letter claiming to be a &#8220;notice of intended suspension&#8221; where he was asked to make representations regarding his suspension however Phahlane has dismissed the letter calling it irregular and only &#8220;meant as window dressing by the SAPS.&#8221;&#8220;I will therefore not be making any representations as called for in the notice of intended suspension,&#8221; he said.Phahlane has been accused of corruption which resulted in a raid at his Sable Hills Waterfront Estate home in Pretoria.In February IPID obtained a search and seizure warrant to look into Phahlane s possession of a home theatre system to the value of R80 000.However Phahlane has denied the claims saying that he had been employed for 32 years and that between himself and his wife generated a joint income of R2.5-million annually. Therefore I don t need no favours from service providers. I have relationships with them but they re not corrupt relationships, said Phahlane in parliament.-TNA Reporter
