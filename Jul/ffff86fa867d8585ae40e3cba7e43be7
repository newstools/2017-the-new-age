ANC head of policy Jeff Radebe says South Africans need to collectively work with renewed vigour towards the implementation of the National Development Plan (NDP) in order to expedite transformation.Radebe was addressing members of the business community yesterday at the ANC s national policy conference.He said it was heartening that most discussions at the six-day conference, which ends today, hinged on the NDP. It is our collective interest to have a vibrant and inclusive economy. We are exceedingly pleased that the NDP has served as a bedrock for most discussions here at the policy conference, he said.He, however, admitted that creating a better nation through the NDP would not be a stroll in the park, adding it will require every South African to play their part. The clearest statement of intent is that South Africa must be a better place to live in by 2030. It was never going to be quick or easy, neither was it a plan for the government alone, he said.Radebe said among some of the things the NDP seeks to achieve are expediting transformation and the ownership of the economy by black people.He added that as long as the face of poverty remained black, there was need to radically transform the economy. He believes that radical economic transformation will go a long way in reducing unemployment and grow the economy to benefit of all South Africans. The call for radical social, economic transformation seeks to address fundamental issues. Speaking at the same event, ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize said that the patterns of ownership are skewed and must be addressed.Mkhize said the marginalised and those who have been advantaged needed to be brought together .MTHOKOZISI DUBEmtokozisid@thenewage.co.za
