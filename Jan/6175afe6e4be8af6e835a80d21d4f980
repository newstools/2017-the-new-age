THE Economic Freedom Fighter and the Democratic Alliance have backtracked on their plan to table a motion of no confidence against the mayor of Metsimaholo local municipality.THIS is after the two parties, who gained control of the municipality through forming a coalition, reached a mutual agreement that one of them(parties) will take over the municipality.The motion had been scheduled to take place this week, as it was already the DA and the EFF were planning to remove Sello Hlasa, who is the leader of the smallest party in council.The motion was mistakenly included in the agenda for the special council sitting and the entire community is now talking about the contents of the motion.Hlasa from the Metsimaholo Civic Association (MCA), which obtained only two seats in that council last year, ascended to power last year after the now rocky coalition was formed.The ANC obtained 19 seats, the DA 12 seats and the EFF got eight seats.In a press conference last week, EFF leader Julius Malema said the EFF was set to take the governance of the municipality and was in talks with the DA.The three parties had formed a coalition. Earlier DA party leader in the province, Patricia Kopane said they had decided on a motion of no confidence in the mayor because he was not supporting the initial plans that they set out at the beginning. It looks like its a case of once an ANC cadre always an ANC cadre, Kopane said yesterday. But the MCA spokesperson, Seabe Maboe, said Hlasa had not backtracked on anything. But he admitted that the coalition is powerless .He said the MCA was still committed to the course of service delivery and would go back to the community to report about the situation incouncil.He said the DA and EFF did not want the mayor to account to relevant entities of government and when he did they saw that as him associating with the ANC. The reality is the premier of this province is Ace Magashule and he is also the leader of the ANC, when he as the premier calls all executive mayors to a meeting Hlasa should also attend. That is protocol, which the other two parties seem to miss, he said. He said the DA and the EFF also criticised Hlasa for attending a Salga meeting saying it was an ANC-led organisation. Now Salga is a government entity why would Hlasa not attend a meeting by Salga, Maboe said.He said the MCA was also set to table a motion of no confidence against the council speaker, the DA s Linda Radebe. This is politics and the MCA also knows politics, Maboe said.kamogelos@thenewage.co.zaKAMOGELO SEEKOEI
