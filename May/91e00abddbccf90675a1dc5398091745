The SACP in the Western Cape has joined its national leadership in calling on President Jacob Zuma to step down.At a press conference held after its eighth provincial congress, the Western Cape region of the SACP also raised the question of contesting elections on its own. In a statement, the regional leg of the SACP said it reaffirmed the national SACP position that Zuma must resign as he is no longer fit and proper to lead the government.New secretary Benson Ngqentsu accused Zuma of using his reckless leadership style for patronage and the abuse of state agencies. Newly elected chairperson Anthony Dietrich said that the debate about state power had been ongoing in the Communist Party for years. He said the SACP was interested in state power. We are not just a party that will remain a party in an alliance but a party that will prepare for state power . The SACP, he said, would lobby for the possibility of taking up an elections posture .Elections were just a platform to ensure socialism was brought to communities, that the economy was transferred from a capitalist to a socialist economy. If we enter party politics in a legislature it s a platform for us to pursue our ultimate goal, Dietrich said.The SACP also deplored the decision of the Eskom board to re-employ Brian Molefe, whom it called a stooge of the Guptas, as CEO. The SACP called for the dissolution of the board and announced it would begin mass action against the decision.The SACP congress also pledged its solidarity with the people of Palestine for national self-determination and independence. It also condemned the violation of the rights of Palestinian people by apartheid Israel.The new provincial executive committee elected at the two-day conference is chairperson Anthony Dietrich, deputy chairperson Nokulunga Sofoyiya, secretary Benson Ngqentsu, treasurer Ernest Theron, first deputy secretary Barry Mitchela and second deputy secretary Sonwabile Ngxiza.DENNIS CRUYWAGENnews@thenewage.co.za
