The Ekurhuleni mayor was forced to deliver his state of the city address in a marquee outside the city council chambers yesterday after chaos erupted in the council yesterday.DA councillor Simon Lapping was taken to the hospital after he was caught in the fight between the EFF councillors and members of Ekurhuleni metro police department who came into the chamber with guns.Before the chaos broke out, EFF councillors had asked speaker Patricia Khumalo to give them an assurance that they would be safe. Two weeks ago while at an extra-ordinary council meeting at this council, we were assaulted by unknown men who were wearing white shirts. The mayor will not deliver his speech until we get a guarantee of safety, EFF chief whip Solly Mkhize said.Khumalo told the councillors that there would be a report to find out where the men in white shirts came from. I also don t know where the men came from, a report will be out soon, Khumalo said.As the EFF councillors argued with the speaker, armed metro police officers entered the chambers with the aim of throwing out unruly EFF councillors.Members of the ANC applauded the officers while the DA councillors took out red cards, moving towards the officers and EFF councillors who were involved in a tussle.All hell broke loose when two officers touched the EFF councillors, fists and chairs flew. DA councillors used their bodies to protect EFF members from being thrown out.The combined parties had the upper hand against the officers and pushed, resulting in them falling like dominos.Present at the chamber were high school children referred to as junior council , who represent school children from across Ekurhuleni.Khumalo granted DA councillors a 20-minute-long caucus break after the party s chief whip Tania Campbell reported that Lapping was injured and the councillors were traumatised. Bringing guns into this house is wrong, there are young children, what would have happened had a gun gone off? Campbell asked.The ANC caucus turned down an opposition proposal for the speaker to recuse herself because she was allegedly biased.After 1pm, as DA and EFF councillors prevented the speech from going ahead after raising points of order, Masina and members of his mayoral committee and guests left the council chambers for a marquee where he addresed residents.NTOMBI NKOSIntombin@thenewage.co.za
