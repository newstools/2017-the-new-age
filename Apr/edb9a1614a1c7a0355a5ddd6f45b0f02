Platinum Stars have been a enjoying a good run this year, recovering from their slump early in the season. They have managed to get themselves out of the relegation zone to ninth place on the Absa Premiership.Their good run has also seen them advance to the quarterfinals of the Nedbank Cup after edging out Baroka FC 1-0 on Tuesday. Now they have a chance to qualify for the CAF Confederation Cup group stages and will do so if they defeat Association Sportive de Tanda of Ivory Coast in the two-legged playoffs. Dikwena travel to Ivory Coast for the first leg on Sunday before hosting the return leg during the Easter weekend.Coach Cavin Johnson said they are well prepared for the away match and expect to continue their impressive run. AS de Tanda is not a bad team, they are good. They didn t end up in the Confederation Cup for nothing, Johnson said. They are a typical West African team. They are very clever when it comes to continental competitions. They go down, they stand up and they lie down for five minutes or so. We are not used to that as South Africans but the one thing that we know is when we go there the pitch will be flat as can be. Johnson said they will be playing on an astro turf pitch on Sunday. That will give both teams a flat surface, not like when we went to Uganda where we played on a hill, but when they came here they played on a good pitch, Johnson said. Meanwhile, Johnson was full of praise for his side after they advanced to the Nedbank Cup quarterfinals after Ndumiso Mabena netted in stoppage time at Peter Mokaba Stadium. This is a good competition to play, I thought both teams could have won the game. They had a few chances that they missed and so did we. I think we hit the upright twice and we could have scored early in the first half and in the second half. They had chances they did not convert. -Neville Khoza|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
