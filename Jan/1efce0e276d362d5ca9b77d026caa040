The Northern Cape government has announced its plans to defeat the widespread corruption and fraud that has hindered service delivery in the province.A draft plan of anti-corruption and fraud management procedures has been made available by the office of the premier.The objective of the plan is to raise awareness of all relevant stakeholders to reduce fraud and corruption in the province through emphasising the importance of bookkeeping and service delivery.The plan comes after it was revealed that public officials in the department of health had misused millions of rands.Some municipalities have had to face the consequences of financial mismanagement after several administrators were put on special leave pending investigations in Renosterberg local municipality.The plan stated that the implementation would be overseen by an anti-corruption officer in the office of the premier. The activities for anti-corruption and fraud management are given effect by an anti-corruption management strategy, which incorporates a whistle-blowing policy, the plan read.According to the plan there would be awareness campaigns to highlight the importance of corruption management and to educate public servants and the community at large on how corruption could hamper service delivery.The provincial department of health was put under administration following allegations of maladministration and corruption.The auditor-general report of the 2015-16 financial year showed that there had been major improvements with regards to clarity and transparency in the financial statements of several departments in the province.The report showed a noticeable improvement in the internal corruption control of provincial departments, but the same could not be said for government-owned entities.The report said officials were held accountable for their actions, but that there was still more that needed to be done to improve the financial transparency and accountability of the different departments.The report also recommended that the departments that received clean audits should share practices with sister departments, particularly departments associated with the delivery of essential services like healthcare and with municipalities, which come into direct contact with residents. Departments can improve the quality of performance reports by reviewing the completeness and the accuracy of the underlying records throughout the year, the report recommended.TIISETSO MANOKOtiisetsom@thenewage.co.za
