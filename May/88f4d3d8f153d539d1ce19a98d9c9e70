Polokwane City caretaker coach Bernard Molekwa remains in the dark about his role following news that troubled coach Luc Eymael has returned.It was reported at the weekend that Eymael, who was found guilty of contravening an order of the league s Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) last week, has since returned to the club. Molekwa has been in charge since Eymael resigned in March to join Bloemfontein Celtic and guided Polokwane City to a respectable position in the Absa Premiership standings. I don t know anything. I just read in one of the papers that he has returned to the club but I haven t seen him, Molekwa said. No one has told me anything. I will continue with what I have been doing until I m told to stop. At the moment I m still a caretaker coach for the club until the last match of the season. Eymael had already accepted a coaching job offer at Celtic, a day after he confirmed he had tendered his resignation at Polokwane City.He was announced as the new head coach for Celtic on March 10, but Polokwane City lodged a complaint with the league, querying his departure from their camp. It was at the PSL DRC where it was ruled that Eymael had a valid and binding contract with Polokwane and that he should return to the club to serve as their head coach for the duration of his deal.Having been found guilty of contravening an order of the DRC last week Tuesday and sentenced to a R100 000 fine (R75 000 of it suspended), it is understood that the Belgian then decided to return to work after he was fined. The statement last week said Eymael will not be allowed to coach anywhere except Polokwane City until the end of June next year.However, with his relationship with Polokwane City management hitting the rocks, it remains to be seen how the coach is going to work at the club. Polokwane City are sixth on the log with 40 points from 29 matches. They conclude their season with a home match against Cape Town City on Saturday.-NEVILLE KHOZA
