Ngwathe Local Municipality in the Northern Free State embarked on a community mobilization program against substance abuse in Tumahole location.The programme is led by municipality s Mayor Joey Mochela in partnership with other government departments in their bid to fight drug abuse substance.Municipality spokesperson Steve Nale said the mayor s intervention follows sporadic attacks on young men who were abusing nyaope.He added that one of the reasons for the programme was that community members were turning vigilantes in an attempt to resolve crime perpetuated by the drug addicts. It started with the community of Tumahole taking the matter into their own hands after a number of complaints were brought forth, South African Police Services also recorded crimes such as house breaking, theft and robberies with alleged nyaope or substance abuse being the cause, Nale said.

Correctional service s is also playing a critical role while also monitoring that former convicts do not start taking nyaope and the police are ensuring that crime is being tackled while dealing with the root cause ,&#8221; Mochela said . &#8221; Parents are encouraged to inform Councillors of any challenge s they face particularly when their children are involved in substance abuse, Mochela said.She added that Social Development department had managed to secure space at various treatment centres across the country to ensure that at least 39 clients are admitted to rehabilitation centres. In addition there were several initiates to ensure that the youth were involved in community activities &#8211; like sport against crime &#8211; to ensure that their lives are not lost to drugs and they are able to reach their potential. -Sipho Jack
