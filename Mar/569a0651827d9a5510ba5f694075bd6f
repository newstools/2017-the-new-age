Rapper AKA has lashed out at &#8220;white media&#8221; for trying to destroy local heroes and celebrities.This comes after an article in the City Press stated that AKA collaborated with &#8216;convicted sex offender&#8217; Okmalumkoolkat who designed the artwork for the Caiphus Song.&#8220;The white media&#8217;s mandate is to destroy YOUR heroes, YOUR celebrities. Perfect example,&#8221; said AKA.White media want to tear down YOUR celebs &amp; YOUR musicians &amp; YOUR heroes when it suits them. Call them out when you see bullshit. AKA (@akaworldwide) March 7, 2017In an article, Garreth van Niekerk writes: &#8220;It s not easy to look at something the same way you did before you knew who made it, particularly when the person who made it is Mlazi Milano-rapper and convicted sex offender Simiso Zwane, AKA Okmalumkoolkat&#8221;.AKA however took exception saying: How many songs has Okmalumkoolkat done with other artists? But AKA asks him to design his cover and this happens. You&#8217;re making your agenda too obvious.&#8221;He added: &#8220;I can&#8217;t speak for the guy but I think he&#8217;s been punished. Furthermore he didn&#8217;t RAPE anyone. He made a big mistake. He still paying for it&#8221;.The rapper said that Okmalumkoolkat owes nobody an explanation except for the victim, his own child and his family. The rest &#8220;self righteous rubbishes&#8221; can go jump.I can&#8217;t speak for the guy but I think he&#8217;s been punished. Furthermore he didn&#8217;t RAPE anyone. He made a big mistake. He still paying for it. AKA (@akaworldwide) March 7, 2017AKA then questioned why fans scream their lungs out at &#8216;a convicted woman abuser (Chris Brown) concert when he performs in South Africa.&#8217;Next time Chris Brown is here I hope you self righteous ones treat Chris Brown like you tryna treat Kool Kat. BE CONSISTENT. Not CONVENIENT. AKA (@akaworldwide) March 7, 2017I better see some placards at the airport when Chris Brown comes back here mxm! Hypocrisy!
