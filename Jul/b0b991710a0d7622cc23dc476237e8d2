Public Servants Association of South Africa (PSA) had on Friday raised its concern over government buildings&#8217; safety plans.The union raised their concern over water sprinklers and smoke detectors that were supposed to kick in when Office of the Premier in Gauteng catched fire last week Friday.PSA said there were no Health and Safety marshals available to assist with the emergency evacuation in the building who were supposed to ensure that members were assisted. It is clear that there is no emergency plan in existence in the Office of the Premier. The Office of the Premier has several disabled staff members and there is no equipment or emergency plan in place to assist staff members in such situations, said PSA provincial manager for Johannesburg, Monica Venter.The PSA, as a representative of thousands of public servants, raised concerns about the conditions of Gauteng government buildings. The employer has showed very little interest and an even slower pace to deal with the situation.The union says their had to force the provincial government to form a joint task team to investigate the conditions of all Gauteng Provincial Buildings, but still no progress made one year later. The safety of our members in government buildings is a serious concern and sadly the conditions are deteriorating daily. This situation could have been prevented if the government buildings are maintained and if employers adhere to safety precautions as stipulated in the Occupation Health and Safety Act , said Venter.-TNA Reporter
