THE Ludeke Methodist Church near Mbizana in the Eastern Cape province was the focal point of the site assessments that were conducted by the National Heritage Council of South Africa (NHC) and South African Heritage Resources Agency (SAHRA) accompanied by the Mbizana local municipality on Thursday. The purpose of the visit to the two sites, Mbongweni, where Winnie Madikizela Mandela was born and Ludeke Church where she tied the knot with Nelson Mandela, was to assess the state of the properties with a view to restore them as heritage sites. This legacy project will not only uplift the icon but also the community of Mbizana in its cultural tourism and economic development , says advocate Sonwabile Mancotywa. Mama Winnie is concerned about the state of conservation of places that contain the history of OR Tambo and herself as well as other historic liberation events such as the Ngquza Rebellion, Mancotywa said. The NHC said that it was important that the country s liberation heritage be documented while stalwarts such as her are still alive, so that the history is as authentic and personal as possible. The church was found in a state that is not fit for occupation but can be restored to be a prime heritage site. The Madikizela homestead in Mbongweni has a great potential of hosting her legacy and all possibilities of grading it as a heritage site will also be investigated. The implementation of the structure programme is expected to be revealed in August 2017. A technical team to work on the project has been established and will comprise of the Mbizana local municipality, Alfred Nzo district municipality, NHC and SAHRA. The delegation will bring in more relevant stakeholders to help. LONDEKA DLAMINI&nbsp;
