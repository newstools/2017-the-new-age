It does change it a little bit but you have to adapt to every field that you play on,&#8221; said Morris .Morris added that is was a shock to him when the team arrived there and discovered that the straight boundaries on the field since it was his first time in New Zealand .Morris is confident of the encounter after his career-best figures of 4/31 in the fifth Momentum ODI against Sri Lanka last week. Morris reiterated the need to start the tour strongly. The team suffered a short turnaround of the schedule and the washed out T20 warm-up match on Tuesday due to inadequate drainage at Napier .Morris says that though they would have loved to play , it was nice to relax after having played a lot of cricket in the recent weeks . He added that it was a blessing in disguise.-TNA Reporter
