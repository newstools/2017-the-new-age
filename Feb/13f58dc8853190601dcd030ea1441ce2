The Gambia&#8217;s press is set to win unprecedented freedom when its new government overhauls the constitution of former leader Yahya Jammeh, its freshly appointed justice minister said Wednesday.Abubacarr Tambadou, a former UN assistant prosecutor, said on being sworn in that he hoped to remove restrictive laws on the media.&#8220;We will be starting a constitutional review process with a view to ensuring that our constitution is relevant and serves the purpose for which Gambians adopted it,&#8221; Tambadou said.Reform &#8220;particularly in the criminal justice sector and media law reform,&#8221; were priorities, he said.Journalists were regularly slapped with crimes including sedition, slander and publication of false news under Jammeh, offences described as &#8220;catch-all&#8221; by Amnesty International, and many served jail time.-AFP&nbsp;
