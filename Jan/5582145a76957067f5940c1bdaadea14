French presidential hopeful Francois Fillon has vowed to fight to the end in the face of allegations his wife was paid for fictitious jobs, saying there are &#8220;forces at work to silence me&#8221;.The campaign of Fillon, a former prime minister who won the conservative Republicans&#8217; nomination last year, has been dealt a serious blow by claims his Welsh-born spouse Penelope did nothing to earn half a million euros ($534,000) paid from public funds over eight years.He has insisted that his wife has always worked for him during his four-decade political career, carrying out tasks including speech editing and representing him at events.&#8220;How can we not consider that there are forces at work to silence me and to weaken my candidacy, or even try to prevent me from appearing?&#8221; said Fillon in an interview with the Journal du Dimanche newspaper.&#8220;It is a terrible plot, but I am sure that the justice system will not allow itself to be exploited by these defamatory allegations,&#8221; added Fillon.&#8220;I will not let myself be defeated &#8230; We do not have the right to allow democracy to be spoiled by this behind-the-scenes manoeuvring, which is why I will fight with all my strength and to the end,&#8221; he said.French authorities this week opened a preliminary inquiry into the allegations, which were first made by satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine, and are also looking into payments Penelope Fillon received from a magazine owned by a friend of Fillon.Francois Fillon told the newspaper that he would only &#8220;answer to justice&#8221; and would &#8220;not submit to a trial by media&#8221;, adding that he had already handed over wage slips to investigators.&#8220;The amount (allegedly) paid is false&#8221;, he said, adding that Le Canard Enchaine had confused &#8220;gross and net&#8221; income.The newspaper alleged that Penelope received the money between 1998 and 2012.It also said that in 2012 and 2013, Penelope Fillon was paid 5,000 euros a month at La Revue des Deux Mondes magazine, owned by a friend of Francois Fillon.-AFP
