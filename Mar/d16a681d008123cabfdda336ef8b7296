The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Limpopo has confirmed that it is behind a message to social grant recipients warning them that their money is &#8220;at risk.&#8221;Grant recipients receive a phone call with an automated message urging them to dial a particular number.The voice receipt message says &#8220;you have received an important message regarding social grants from the DA&#8221;.After following the message prompts, The New Age spoke to a DA representative who identified herself as Matshediso Nkosi.&#8220;The message is being sent to alert grant recipients of the risk that their grants may not be paid on the 1st of April,&#8221; said Nkosi.&#8220;We are also telling the people what it is the DA and Mmusi Maimane are doing to ensure that the grants will be paid.&#8221;Asked how the DA acquired recipients contact details, Nkosi said that the numbers were part of a data-base collected by the DA on an on-going basis.The message comes after Sassa on Wednesday requested the Constitutional Court to grant it permission to extend its contract with Cash Paymaster Services for between 12 to 18 months.Meanwhile the ANC in KwaZulu-Natal has strongly criticised the DA saying it was &#8220;causing panic&#8221; among grant recipients and &#8220;spreading propaganda&#8221;.&#8220;It is important to note that social grants are a means of survival for millions of people and therefore it is important to ensure that political parties, such as the DA, do not cause unnecessary panic and spread untruths,&#8221; said ANC Provincial spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli in a statement.&#8220;We urge the DA to stop behaving like political vultures and appreciate the plight of the people in this matter. For once, act responsibly and try to serve the interest of the poor,&#8221; said Ntuli.President Jacob Zuma, responding to questions posed by MP&#8217;s in the National Assembly on Thursday, once again assured that social grants would be paid on 1 April.&#8211;Siphiwe Mchunu
