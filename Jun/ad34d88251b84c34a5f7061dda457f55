The rand reacted slowly when the April trade surplus was announced yesterday. The surplus narrowed to R5.08bn, from R11.28bn in March, but analysts said improvements in the trade account are expected to be sustained in the long run. Overall, the trade account has registered a surplus of R9.89bn for the first four months of the year. The currency opened at R13.10/$ yesterday, having traded to R13.16/$ on Tuesday. After the release of the trade data, the rand strengthened to R13.12/$, and two hours later dropped 1.52% to trade at R13.16/$. “The momentum is still in favour of rand weakness, and one can make an argument that the political environment is now actually worse than it was a week ago,” RMB currency specialist, John Cairns, said. The Revenue Service (SARS), which released trade statistics for April yesterday, said the year-to-date trade balance surplus (January 1 to April 30) of R9.89bn is an improvement on the deficit for the comparable period in 2016 of R26.39bn. The R5.08bn surplus has been attributable to exports of R91.78bn and imports of R86.70bn. “Exports for the year-to-date since January 1 to 30 April grew by 6.4% from R338.75bn in 2016 to R360.27bn this year. Imports drop from R350.38bn less than the imports recorded in the same period last year of R365.14bn. Laura Campbell, senior economist at Econometrix, said the outcome was marginally below expectations but the underlying improvement in the balance of trade of the past year was sustained. “The surplus would have been still greater were it not for the steep increase in the value of oil imports. “However, imports of capital equipment, intermediate and consumer goods have all declined substantially in the first four months of the year, while the value of oil imports has increased by a quarter,” she said. Campbell said on the whole, the underlying improvement in the balance of trade represented a positive structural shift in the state of the economy, with less spending on goods with borrowed money but with a benefit from improved exports. “Accordingly, the underlying improvement in the balance of trade should help to prevent the rand from depreciating as much as it did a few years ago and this in turn should help to stave off the need to raise interest rates any time soon.” Towards the closing bell, the rand was at R13.16/$. -BERNARD SATHEKGE|bernards@thenewage.co.za
