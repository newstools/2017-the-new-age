National coach Baxter will return to the bench for the last time as SuperSport United coach when they meet Orlando Pirates in the Nedbank Cup final at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday.Baxter will be in the dugout on Saturday and will be looking to bow out with a bang by defending the Nedbank Cup title and becoming the first coach to win it three times in a row with three different teams. Baxter excluded himself from SuperSport Caf Confederation Cup matches as he was preparing Bafana Bafana team that played Nigeria in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier last week and Zambia in the friendly match.Assistant coach Kaitano Tembo has been preparing the team for the Con- federation Cup matches. Tembo said Baxter was always involved in the team planning for matches and training sessions. In terms of our planning, it has always been standard since coach Baxter arrived, Tembo said. Our planning has been the same, he is a professional coach and we do our day-to-day planning together. So I knew what needed to be done and he s got a certain structure, which has made it easy for me. We always know what to do, the same goes for the players and the technical team. In Baxter s absence, United did well in the Confederation Cup group stages and were joint leaders in their group with TP Mazembe and Horay FC before last night s match against Mazembe at Lucas Moripe Stadium.SuperSport goalkeeper Ronwen Williams said they aim to send Baxter off with a victory against the Buccaneers on Saturday. We just want to go out there and do our best. Obviously we will do it for ourselves and send him off with a bang. He has been amazing for this club, and what he has done for many of us. Before he came in, my confidence was low I was conceding a lot of goals, silly goals, Williams said. He took my game to another level. -NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
