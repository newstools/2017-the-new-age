Gene therapy delivered by a benign virus enabled deaf lab mice to hear for the first time, researchers said Monday, offering hope for people with genetic hearing impairments.The breakthrough could pave the way for gene-based treatments, they reported in two studies, published in Nature Biotechnology.&#8220;With more than 100 genes already known to cause deafness in humans, there are many patients who may eventually benefit from this technology,&#8221; said Konstantina Stankovic, a professor at Harvard Medical School.Genetic hearing disorders affect some 125 million people worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.An expert not involved in the research welcomed the findings as &#8220;very encouraging&#8221;, but cautioned the technique has yet to be proven safe, and that human trials are likely years away.In the first study, Stankovic and colleagues used a harmless virus to transport &#8212; deep into the mouse ear &#8212; a gene that can fix a specific form of hereditary deafness.Previous attempts had failed, but this time the viral package was delivered to the right address: the so-called outer hair cells that &#8220;tune&#8221; the inner ear to sound waves.&#8220;Outer hair cells amplify sound, allowing inner hair cells to send a stronger signal to the brain,&#8221; explained Gwenaelle Geleoc, a researcher at the F.M. Kirby Neurobiology Center at Boston Children&#8217;s Hospital.The technique bestowed hearing and balance &#8220;to a level that&#8217;s never been achieved before,&#8221; she said in a statement.&#8220;Now you can whisper, and the mice can hear you.&#8221;In the second study, a team led by Geleoc used the same viral courier to treat mice with a mutated gene responsible for Usher syndrome, a rare childhood genetic disease that causes deafness, loss of balance, and in some cases blindness.The virus carried a normal version of the same gene to damaged ear hair cells soon after the mice were born.&#8211; Narrow time window &#8211;The results far exceeded anything to date: 19 of 25 treated mice heard sounds quieter than 80 decibels. Normal human conversation is about 70 decibels.A few of the mice could hear sounds as soft as 25 to 30 decibels &#8212; roughly equivalent to whispering.According to Margaret Kenna, a specialist in genetic hearing loss at Boston Children&#8217;s Hospital not involved in the studies, &#8220;cochlear implants are great, but your own hearing is better.&#8221;Electronic implants work by bypassing damaged hair cells in the ear to send sound signals directly to the brain.&#8220;Anything that could stabilise or improve native hearing at an early age would give a huge boost to a child&#8217;s ability to learn and use spoken language,&#8221; she said.The need for early intervention, however, could be a problem in itself, other experts pointed out.In humans, such an intervention would ideally have to happen before a child is born, said Jonathan Ashmore, a professor at University College London&#8217;s Ear Institute.Alan Boyd, president of Britain&#8217;s Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine hailed &#8220;a very encouraging result&#8221;.&#8220;But it is only a mouse model,&#8221; he cautioned, noting that it is still unknown how the human immune system might react.Any gene deafness treatment is &#8220;at least three years away, if not more,&#8221; Boyd conjectured.-AFP
