Former Bafana Bafana defender Bryce Moon has been given a lifeline by Maritzburg United, who decided to retain him before the close of the transfer window on Tuesday afternoon.The 30 year old s future at the club had been uncertain as he battled to win over then coach Ernst Middendorp. Even under caretaker Fadlu Davids, the versatile Moon didn t feature at all.And when he was not spotted by new coach Roger de Sa for almost a week, speculation was rife that he had been released.However, a source within the club has quashed the rumours. Bryce has had a nagging injury which he carried while playing for Platinum Stars. The management loves him because he is a Pietermaritzburg boy but have told him to pull up his socks since he is among the highly paid players.The new coach has also had his say because he believes Moon will guide the youngsters and add experience when the going gets tough. It s up to him now to repay the faith shown to him by the management and coach. Meanwhile, SuperSport United coach Stuart Baxter is upbeat that latest signing Mandla Masango will add value to the club.Masango joined SuperSport on loan from Danish side Randers until the end of the campaign.He previously played under Baxter at Kaizer Chiefs. We have a nicely settled squad now and were not really looking to bring in anyone mid-season, but when the chance came to sign Mandla I had the confidence of having worked with him before, Baxter said. So I know he will adapt quickly and hopefully add an extra spark as we compete on domestic and continental fronts. LINDA XIMBA news@thenewage.co.za
