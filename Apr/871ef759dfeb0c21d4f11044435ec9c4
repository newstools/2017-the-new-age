Kaizer Motaung pays his tribute to the legendary former Kaizer Chiefs coach Jeff Butler.The Naturena boys&#8217; chairman says Butler made a huge contribution during his tenure at Kaizer Chiefs.&#8220;I think that the history of Kaizer Chiefs would not be complete without the success that Jeff Butler brought to us because when he came in 1988, we struggled, but in 1989 we won the league and we also won, I think it was the BOB Save if am not mistaken, and we won again in 1992 and we won a treble,&#8221; Motaung said.Motaung described Butler as a workaholic and a very dedicated Coach.&#8221;He was not a three-hour manager, he was always there the whole day to work even when the team has left,&#8221; he said speaking to Metro FM.Motaung reiterated the words by another legend of the game Doctor Khumalo who described Butler as a very strict coach .&#8221;Jeff will be solely missed by all of us at Kaizer Chiefs and of course there are many stories that can be told about Jeff, his life was very simple, &#8221; said Motaung .Motaung brought the decorated coach to the Naturena side in the 1990&#8217;s and he came to win a lot of accolades with the team. Kaizer Chiefs requested a moment of silence at their match against Super Sport United in tribute of their former coach.Butler came to Chiefs to mentor a breed of players that came to represent the country and became legends in their own right, amongst those players were Doctor Khumalo, Donald &#8220;Ace&#8221; Khuse, Lucas Radebe, Neil Tovey, and Shane McGregor.When he left the team in 1996, he had won the JPS Knockout Cup in 1988 , the league championship the following season and also the BP Top Eight Cup, Ohlsson&#8217;s Challenge and the Charity Spectacular .Butler also coached the national team for a short period.He passed away this past weekend on Sunday after a long illness .-TNA Reporter
