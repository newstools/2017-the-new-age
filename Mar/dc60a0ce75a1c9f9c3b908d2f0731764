The ANC stalwarts shocked because certain members of the ANC s national working committee (NWC) have expressed a view that a National Consultative Conference was never agreed to.The stalwarts, which include surviving members of the 1963/4 Rivonia Treason Trial, former leaders of the United Democratic Front among others, have been in discussion with the ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) since last year about about what it considers a crisis of leadership within the organisation.In a press statement released on Friday the stalwarts expressed their concern about a views expressed, during a meeting held last month with the NWC, that certain members &#8230; expressed the view that it was never the decision of the NEC to hold a National Consultative Conference, this is despite the documentary evidence .The stalwarts then refer to a statement of the NEC of November 26 to 28 which states that the NEC resolved to extend by one extra day the National Policy Conference in June 2017 for the conference.The NEC statement reads from that NEC reads: The first two days of Conference will be utilised to assess the state of the organisation as envisaged in the veteran&#8217;s call for a Consultative Conference. In that way, the Policy Conference is able to deal with issues that were raised as necessitating a Consultative Conference. The stalwarts said it would tackle ANC elected officials involved in the discussion with the stalwarts and did not immediately correct this deliberate distortion at the next preparatory meeting.While not naming the parties involved in the dissent the stalwarts said that it was left with the strong impression that there was neither a strong desire nor commitment on the part of some individuals within the leadership to seriously engage on the crisis facing the ANC .It accused the group of working collectively to attempt to avoid any critical discussion that may threaten their interests, irrespective of the damage to the country and the ANC , and suggested that these individuals were doing this for self-enrichment.
