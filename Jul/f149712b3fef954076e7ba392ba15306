South Africa s economy is likely to be hurt by the exit of several businesses, small and big, as they fail to realise profits in the poor economic and political climate. In May, vehicle manufacturer General Motors (GM) said it was disinvesting while iconic retailer Stuttafords had closed its doors after falling victim to the economic downturn.Several mining companies are considering wholesale retrenchments while others want to shut down completely. This is just another sign of how the changes which took place in March and April have affected SA s businesses, Gillian Saunders, head of advisory services at Grant Thornton, said during a presentation on second-quarter international business trends. We are recording dramatic changes in sentiment when comparing the first and second quarters of this year. It s very concerning. About 37% of companies are delaying business expansion plans, 32% are putting off investment decisions and 26% considering investing offshore, the report found.The top three constraints to business growth for South African executives are economic uncertainty, exchange rate fluctuation and over-regulation. Delaying business decisions, stalling company expansion and investing offshore will negatively impact GDP growth, Saunders said.-BERNARD SATHEKGE|bernards@thenewage.co.za
