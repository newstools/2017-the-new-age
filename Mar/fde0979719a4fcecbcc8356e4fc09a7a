Venezuela&#8217;s Supreme Court took over legislative powers Thursday, after ruling the opposition-majority National Assembly was in contempt of court in an ongoing power struggle with leftist President Nicolas Maduro.&#8220;As long as the National Assembly&#8217;s contempt of court and invalidity persist, parliamentary powers shall be exercised directly by (the Supreme Court&#8217;s) constitutional chamber or by the body it stipulates to safeguard the rule of law,&#8221; the high court said in a ruling issued late Wednesday.The court ruled in August 2016 that the opposition majority in the National Assembly was in contempt for swearing in three lawmakers who were suspended over alleged electoral fraud &#8212; charges the opposition condemns as a trumped-up bid to curb its power.-AFP
