Could it be a case of sabotage or does Prince Harry s girlfriend Meghan Markle truly not have what it takes to be a princess?Judging by the pictures of her beach wedding with ex-husband Trevor Engelson, the royal family may not be too pleased. Pictures show the 35 year old wearing a skimpy, yellow polka-dot bikini and baseball cap.Described as a bit of a beach bum , she can be seen taking part in a wheelbarrow race with a bottle of local lager Red Stripe. The beach-themed wedding took place in 2011 in front of 100 guests in Jamaica Inn in Ocho Rios after seven years of dating.Markle has hogged the media spotlight amid a wave of abuse and harassment which saw the Kensington Palace issuing a public statement in November last year calling on people to stop harassing her. Some of this has been very public. The smear on the front page of a national newspaper, the racial undertones of comment pieces and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls, the statement read.The compromising photos come hardly two months after she received a backlash from fans when a scene from season three of her TV show, Suits, showed her in bed with her costar Patrick J Adams.The question of sabotage has emerged based on the timing of the release of the photos as she s expected to accompany Harry to her best friend, Tom Inskip s, wedding in Jamaica.Harry will be the best man, giving Markle a starring role by association.NONTOKOZO GXUMISA
