CONTRARY to popular belief, former Bafana Bafana captain Mbulelo OJ Mabizela has not retired from the beautiful game. The talented but wayward player has been out of the limelight for about a year since National First Division side Royal Eagles booted him out for misconduct.However, during off season municipal tournaments, Mabizela has given fans reason to cheer with his impressive displays in central defence for KZN Legends. Now aged 36, Mabizela believes he still has a lot to offer local football if given a chance. I have not called it quits yet. I am still going strong. It s just that people tend to focus on my reputation and history and think I m finished. Any team interested in my services, I m available. One day I will have a chance to tell my side of the story and put to rest these bad boy stories once and for all, Mabizela said.Tipped as the next big sensation from South Africa in Europe, Mabizela disappointed due to ill-discipline and going truant. A lot was expected of him after English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur signed him for R20m in 2003, a year after captaining Orlando Pirates to the league title.His spell was cut short in the UK and he then turned out for Norway s Valerenga, Mamelodi Sundowns, Platinum Stars, Bidvest Wits, Chippa United, Mpumalanga Black Aces and AmaZulu. Eagles have signed Dumisani Tau, the brother of Bafana Bafana and Sundowns rising star Percy Tau. The midfielder joins from Witbank Spurs, a team that helped develop Percy s talent before returning a more complete player at Sundowns last season. Eagles, who will be coached by exPlatinum Stars and Highlands Park coach Allan Freese, have also signed exMthatha Bush Bucks midfielder Mazwi Jomo Ncube.news@thenewage.co.za-Linda Ximba
