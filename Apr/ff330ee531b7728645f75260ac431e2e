The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) has on Tuesday announced that they no longer believed that President Jacob Zuma is the right person to unite, lead the movement, alliance and the country.&#8220;We think, after all his undeniable contribution to both the movement and the country, the time has come for him to step down and allow the country to be led forward by a new collective at a government level,&#8221; said COSATU General Secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali.The trade union federation was briefing the media on the outcomes of the central executive committee (CEC) meeting held in Johannesburg.Ntshalintshali said for the first time under the leadership of President Zuma, Cosatu was not consulted about the latest Cabinet reshuffle.&#8220;The CEC will be demanding both the movement and the President to give us an explanation on why we were not consulted as an alliance partner, and what led to the abandonment of such longstanding traditions.&#8220;We are currently experiencing a period of deep divisions within the ANC, the President s lack of constructive engagement has added to such divisions,&#8221; he said.Ntshalintshali added President Zuma has failed to deal with some of the poor performing Ministers in the cabinet, proving that this Cabinet reshuffle was not based on merit but on political loyalty.&#8220;We have looked at whether the reshuffle was based on merit and also if it assisted the fight for radical economic transformation, we also looked at whether the reshuffle helped the fight against corruption, he said.The union said that the Treasury could not be transformed by an individual.&#8220;All Ministers, including the former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, have been captured and transformed by the institution instead of them transforming the institution, there is no Finance Minister who has been the friend of the workers including Gordhan.&#8221;However, in future Cosatu said they would support the new Minister where necessary and fight with him where necessary.TNA Reporter
