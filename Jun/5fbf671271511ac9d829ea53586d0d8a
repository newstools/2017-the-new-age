Televison personality Minnie Dlamini is having a fabulous 2017.After ditching SABC1 s SoccerZone, Dlamini came back stronger with two television shows, Tropika Island of Treasure on SABC3 and Homeground, which is broadcast on SuperSport and Mzansi Magic.To celebrate the year and her seven years in show business, the Durban-born 27-year-old entertainer recently took to social media to gush over her latest achievement.She posted a series of snap shots showing off her beautiful body, taken during her recent trip to Brazil as part of the Champions Voyage.This was where she rubbed shoulders with some South American athletes, among them two-time Fifa footballer of the year Ronaldinho.Don&#8217;t miss @MyTropika Island of Treasure Seychelles tonight at 7:30pm on @SABC3!

I put in 110% into every very deep end I was thrown into.&#8221;I just interviewed Legend @ronaldinho such a cool guy #ChampionTheMatch with @Heineken_SA pic.twitter.com/qbvMcImhtK Minenhle Dlamini (@MinnieDlamini) June 4, 2017 Today I host two hit TV shows. The one show is viewed across Africa on SuperSport. I have my own production company. I m doing my bit to improve impoverished communities and working on strategies to make them self-sustainable and then sometime soon I get to say I do to the love of my life. I still dream bigger and bigger each day. Ngyabonga, the former Rockville actress posted.-NONTOKOZO GXUMISA
