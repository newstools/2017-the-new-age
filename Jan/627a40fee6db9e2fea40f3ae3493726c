FUNERAL costs for Mmadillo Mankamo, the woman who died in the recent floods in Senekal, will be carried by various government departments, church organisations and the municipality.They have committed to provide the impoverished family with a casket, food and all other costs for the funeral which will take place tomorrow. A memorial service and night vigil will be held before the funeral.Those who have offered a helping hand include the SAPS, Sassa, the departments of health, social development, CPF, the traffic department, churches, the municipality and NGOs. Mankamo, from Matwabeng, was found dead on Sunday morning after she was swept away as she tried to cross a river during the storm. Indeed unity is power. Although funerals today are very expensive and not everyone is able to afford them, but as stakeholders we will help the family to bury their loved one, Senekal s Sam Tlali said.Signs of the powerful floods remain visible around Senekal as drifts that are meant to control water movement have been swept clear and culverts are blocked by uprooted trees.Household items such as blankets have been seen hanging outside to dry in the sun. Setsoto local municipality said the damage is estimated at more than R300000. Social workers are counselling the storm and flood victims.Ward counsellor Oscar Ralehlatsi said Setsoto municipality was working around the clock to help the victims. I don t have anything to say other than thank you to my ward councillor and stakeholders for organising everything for us, family representative Tumahole Msibi said. Stakeholders director Nyakane Monkoe told The New Age that after the funeral they would meet to evaluate things and see how they could continue to make an impact on the community of Senekal.-THABO THULO
