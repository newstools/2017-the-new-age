Former SABC chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng s disciplinary hearing is expected to resume today in Johannesburg after his failed bid to prevent it in court.The disciplinary hearing, which was postponed to allow Motsoeneng to approach the Labour Court, relates to a media briefing he held.He went to court as he was dissatisfied with the disciplinary hearing chairman Nazeem Cassim as he was of the view that he would not receive a fair hearing from him.Motsoeneng s legal team also argued that his hearing should be conducted by the Commission for Conciliation, Medication and Arbitration (CCMA) as the remarks he made at the media briefing should be considered protected public disclosure.SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago yesterday said: As far as I m concerned, the hearing will be happening. At the briefing, which took place on April 19, Motsoeneng lambasted SABC interim board member Krish Naidoo.Motsoeneng also used the briefing to defend the 90% local content ruling on the SABC. But the 90% policy has been blamed for costing the broadcaster more than R210m in lost advertising and audience since its implementation. The board said it was in the process of reviewing it.Last year, the Western Cape High Court ruled that Motsoeneng may not hold any executive position at the broadcaster until he had faced a disciplinary hearing as the former public protector Thuli Madonsela s report ordered.The court found that his appointment as the SABC s group executive of corporate affairs was irrational and unlawful.He lost his position in September last year when the Supreme court of Appeal dismissed his leave to appeal against a ruling that had set aside his permanent appointment.zodidim@thenewage.co.za
