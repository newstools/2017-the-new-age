With the new school year already in its second week, Bloemfontein police have taken the opportunity to visit schools and address some crime-related issues and drug use.Kagisanong police said they were concerned at the rising trend of drug use among people.They have started a programme where they visit various schools to speak to pupils about crime and advise them not to get involved indrugs. The main aim is to help pupils who are fresh from primary school and now at high school to make informed and wise decisions as the year begins, police said.So far, the police, along with members of the CPF, Kagisanong youth desk and the ward councillor have been to two schools. On Friday they paid pupils at Moedimo High School in Rocklands a visit and did the same at Ikaelelo secondary on Monday. They have reached about 1871 pupils at both schools.The officer responsible for the community at the Kagisanong precinct, Const Ezekiel Radebe, said pupils should not give in to peer pressure but when they saw that things were getting tough they should speak out and seek help. The teachers, parents and the police are here for you, don t turn to crime and drugs for help but come to us, our doors are always open, Radebe said.Station commander Col Lepile Kakudi also urged the pupils to report criminal activities they saw in their schools and homes and said the aim of the school visit was to create a crime-free environment at schools. As we continue with this campaign you need to be aware that those pupils who we find in possession of dangerous weapons and/or drugs at schools will be arrested and charged, Kakudi said.The first visit was at Nanabolela Secondary School in Thabong on the day schools opened.A team of police from Thabong cluster led by Col Envor Solomon and Col David Ramoolla visited pupils on behalf of the provincial commissioner Lt-Gen Lebeoane Tsumane to talk about the dangers of drugs, bullying and committing crime. The provincial commissioner sent us today to share this message. If you join gangs the consequences are dreadful and you will end up in jail or in the cemetery because crime does not pay, Ramoolla said.KAMOGELO SEEKOEIkamogelos@thenewage.co.za
