The infamous Danish clitoris collector trial has been delayed again after the accused fired his new lawyer and rehired the old one.In one of his court appearances last year, Peter Frederiksen s lawyer withdrew from representing him because he had not been paid.Frederiksen said his family in Denmark was going to pay his legal fees, but it turned out they only had R50000 which wasn t enough.The court then gave him an opportunity to apply for legal aid.His application was successful and he was allocated a legal aid lawyer.On Friday, when he was supposed to be given a trial date by the Bloemfontein High Court, he fired the Legal Aid lawyer and rehired his private lawyer, causing yet another postponement.The 64-year-old man is on trial for allegedly surgically removing and freezing women s genitals at his home in Langehoven Park.He looked rather exhausted when he made his brief court appearance on Friday.He told the court that his family in Denmark would pay his legal fees.Frederiksen said he did not have confidence in Legal Aid, so he told the court that he was able to convince his family to give him more money which will last for the duration of the trial.He will now be represented by Howard Woolf, who represented him in the past, but discontinued due to lack of payment by the accused.Judge Soma Naidoo postponed the case to provide Frederiksen and his attorney Woolf time to consult before their next appearance on Thursday.Prosecutor Amanda Bester spoke outside court on Friday, saying Frederiksen was well within his rights to acquire his preferred legal team but he must also know that at some point the case will have to continue. The judge will provide him all the time he needs but it cannot be forever, she said.Frederiksen was arrested in September 2015 after small packets containing 21 clitorises and an assortment of tools used to slice off women s genitals were allegedly found in his house Frederiksen is accused among others of a total of 59 charges including several counts of illegally removing human tissues.He is also accused of conspiring to commit murder after he was linked to the murder of his wife, Anna Molise.Molise was gunned down in her home town of Maseru, Lesotho in October 2015, a few weeks after Frederiksen was arrested.Frederiksen had previously received a six-month prison sentence in Denmark relating to the illegal possession of firearms and ammunition, while he had also been released on bail pending a charge of assault in Lesotho.He is also charged with illegally dealing with firearms, several counts of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and other counts of manufacturing and distribution of weapons.MICHAEL TLHAKUDIprovinces@thenewage.co.za
