CPI inflation is now back within the Reserve Bank’s target of 3%-6% for the first time in nine months, helping to boost the rand to under R13/$. As good as the news may be, it’s unlikely to push the Reserve Bank monetary policy committee into an interest rate cut announcement today. The benchmark repo rate has been at 7% for 14 months. Stats SA said yesterday headline consumer inflation fell to 5.3% year-on-year in April, from 6.1% in March, as food price rises slowed, sending the rand to a new four-week high and boosting hopes for a rate cut later this year. Market expectations were for a 5.5% year-on-year print. On a month-on-month basis, inflation fell to 0.1% from 0.6% previously. “The latest inflation figure supports our view that the Bank will cut its key policy rate later this year,” Capital Economics Africa economist John Ashbourne said. But he expected no move today. Food inflation, which climbed close to 12% in 2016 during the drought, slowed to 6.7% year-on-year. Nedbank’s economic research unit team calculated that speculation will now turn to when the Reserve Bank MPC will consider easing policy. “We still think they will remain cautious given the volatile global and especially local environment, easing only in early 2018,” the team said. -BERNARD SATHEKGE|bernards@thenewage.co.za
