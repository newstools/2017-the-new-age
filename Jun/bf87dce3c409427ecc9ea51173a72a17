M-NET was forced to issue a statement to explain a questionable voting scandal which hit the reality music competition, The Voice South Africa, on Tuesday.The channel blames the scandal involving members of the top 5 to be paid for social media marketing efforts as likely among the reasons some of the talent search firm favourites, Luke Lovemore and PJ Pretorius were booted out of the competition more than two weeks ago.The two were then called back into the competition after it emerged that illicit paid-for marketing campaigns, which are against the competition s rules, were being used by some of the contestants. Despite our best efforts, we could not determine with certainty whether misconduct took place and what the impact was on the voting results. We believe the fairest solution under these circumstances is to give all the affected talent another chance, Nkateko Mabaso, general manager of M-Net South Africa, said.
