Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe announced on Sunday that the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) and the post Office have reached an agreement for grant payments. “I am delighted today to announce to members of the media and the South African nation that we have reached a landmark agreement between the South African Post Office and the South African Social Security Agency to bring to life a new grants payment system,” he said. The new deal between SAPO and SASSA was signed on December 8. Meanwhile, the new payment model is expected to be implemented by 1 April 2018. The new agreement gives effect to the implementation of the phasing in of the Post Office and the Postbank as a service provider and also as one of the channels through which grants will be distributed.   Under the new model SAPO will be responsible for electronic banking services, on-boarding of new beneficiaries into the system, and biometric authentication of beneficiaries amongst other roles. Radebe said that following the submission of the consolidated model to the Constitutional Court on 8 December as part of the implementation plan which makes provision for four key channels through which beneficiaries will receive their grants.   Grant payments will now be issued through channels of the beneficiaries’ choice.   “Bank account, Post Bank of SAPO countrywide, or merchants including village banks and Spaza shops that are legally registered, South African owned and operated,” he said. The minister said that this partnership was based on the principle of building State’s capacity. “This new system while drawing on the resources and capabilities of the South African democratic state, will also make allowance for the participation of other partners such as enterprises and commercial banks, in the payment of social grants to beneficiaries,” he said. -TNA Reporter
