Claudio Ranieri will not have to wait long for another job following his sacking by Leicester City, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola said on Tuesday.Leicester&#8217;s decision to sack Ranieri less than 300 days after he took them to the Premier League title reverberated around world football and surprised Guardiola.&#8220;Yes of course (it was a surprise),&#8221; the Spaniard, whose side face second-tier Huddersfield Town in an FA Cup fifth round replay on Wednesday, told reporters.&#8220;But I think Claudio has to be proud. He is going to find immediately a new job.&#8221;Leicester rediscovered their form on Monday in their first match since Ranieri&#8217;s sacking last week, outplaying Liverpool 3-1 to climb out of the relegation zone.&#8220;Yesterday I saw the game against Liverpool, it was his legacy. The way Leicester play was outstanding,&#8221; he said.&#8220;In 50 years&#8217; time people will talk about what Leicester achieve with this group. The best legacy, the first game when he left, Leicester play like last season.&#8221;With no Premier League game last weekend, City enjoyed a short break in Abu Dhabi before returning to face promotion-chasing Huddersfield.&#8220;We just trained two days. We cleared our minds. We stayed together, worked together,&#8221; Guardiola said.&#8220;(Huddersfield) are (near the) top of the Championship and sometimes teams top of the Championship are stronger than some of the teams in the Premier League.&#8221;City, who are third in the Premier League and well-placed to reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League after a 5-3 home win against Monaco last week, will be without defender Vincent Kompany again on Wednesday.But Guardiola says the injury-plagued Belgian is nearly fit to return after a leg problem.&#8220;He is much better but not tomorrow, soon,&#8221; he said.-Reuters
