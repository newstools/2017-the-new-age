Alun Wyn Jones has replaced Sam Warburton as Wales captain for the upcoming Six Nations Championship, the Welsh Rugby Union announced Tuesday.&#8220;It s an honour to select Alun Wyn as captain,&#8221; said Wales interim head coach Rob Howley as he named a 36-man squad for the Six Nations. &#8220;His vast experience, as a player and a leader will help drive this squad forward and I believe he will flourish in the role.&#8220;Sam has led Wales more times than any other captain and had great success in the role, however we want him to concentrate on his game and to be the best player he can be,&#8221; former Wales scrum-half Howley added.-AFP
