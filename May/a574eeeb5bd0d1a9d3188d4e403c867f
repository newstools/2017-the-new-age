The words of Jaques to Rosalind, in William Shakespeare s As You Like It, came to mind once again as a judicial decision was made that would have political consequences on our country.Jaques, a melancholic traveller, says to Rosalind: I have neither the scholar s melancholy, which is emulation; nor the musician s, which is fantastical; nor the courtier s, which is proud; nor the soldier s, which is ambitious; nor the lawyer s, which is political In trying to explain his own unique Achilles heel to the heroine, as it were, Jaques identifies for us the weakness of lawyers politics.Shakespeare would not be at a loss South Africa for finding lawyer s and members of the judiciary in particular who have had influenced, maybe even undue influence, on our country s history and its democracy today.While they later proved to be regressive, the thinking behind Thomas Sankara s establishment of the People s Revolutionary Tribunals in Burkino Faso was precisely so that there was seen to be a break with the judicial system that existed in the previous order.The judiciary, the thinking was, had to be transformed so that it was congruent with the values and principles espoused by the new dispensation. As South Africa negotiated its new dispensation it chose a constitutional democracy, based on the model used by the United States of America, rather than a majoritarian model, as is found in the UK.The apartheid rulers knew the power of a parliamentary supremacy and therefore chose to demand a consociational model, as articulated by the Dutch political scientist, Arendt Lijphart, which was ultimately about power sharing rather than its antithesis, the rule of the majority.In ensuring that South Africa became a constitutional democracy, those who negotiated the settlement ascribed to the judiciary, rather than the people through the legislative and executive means, the determination of what was to be permitted in our democracy.The people are therefore no longer supreme. The people are not governing.As a result, while the separation of powers is the foundation of any modern, democratic state, one of the powers, inevitably usurps a role that could be seen as the first among equals.Yet despite this role, though first among equals, that power remains open to be kept in check by the other two and is therefore not open to abuse. For example, recently in the UK which is based on a parliamentary system, the courts ruled that the Brexit vote, despite going to a general referendum, had to be sent to Parliament for a vote.Thus contradicting the executive and keeping it in check. While the people had spoken, Parliament remains supreme. In his own bid to ensure the protection of the powers of the executive and the government, to pursue its policies independently, though based on an electoral mandate, former president Thabo Mbeki, in his letter from the president in March 2001, wrote: It is unfortunate that this matter of human rights, human dignity and life itself, should have ended up in our courts, as though it would ever constitute an act of justice if we were to adopt laws that make it difficult for us to achieve the objective of health for all.Nevertheless, as before, we will respect whatever decision is ultimately handed down by our judiciary. Certainly, while Mbeki and his administration went on to respect the outcome of that judicial decision both in the high court and later in the highest court of our land, the ConCourt on treatment for those who are HIV positive, he would be the first to admit that the judgment had a direct impact on determining the extent of the policies pursued now by both the executive and the legislature.Even more so, given his own second administration s appealing of the Nicholson judgement, president Mbeki went on to write in early 2016: Thus did judge Nicholson give a judicial stamp of approval to an allegation that some had sustained for some time that I and others in the government were part of a political conspiracy which had interfered with the NPA falsely to charge Jacob Zuma an allegation which even the ANC NEC as a whole had rejected. As with the ConCourt decision on public health policy, Mbeki would be familiar with the dire political consequences of both the Squires judgment, which he somewhat misused, and that of the Nicholson judgments. Both these judgments illustrated the near catastrophic role that our courts could play in the political landscape of our country.Indeed, our lawyers suffer from no small bout of melancholy for the political. We have read with interest the reasons given by judge Bashir Vally for his order compelling President Jacob Zuma to provide the rationale behind his latest Cabinet reshuffle.Some have suggested that it was foreseeable that the court would make such a ruling, given that the head of the executive derives the exclusive right to appoint and appoint members of the executive at his prerogative.It is the constitutional democracy that once again allows for such a court ruling. But is politics this lawyer s melancholy? Judge Vally has a history in the trade union movement and labour law primarily.We may suggest that he has handed down some progressive judgments in the past particularly those pertaining to the silicosis class action and maintenance order against Steve Hofmeyer.Yet #FeesMustFall activists would know that it was Vally who granted Wits University an interim interdict thus allowing the university to engage in a number of clamp down measures and which seriously curtailed the activism of student and academics.As a result, activists were prevented from engaging in nonviolent protest activity such as occupying Senate House, offices and lecture theatres. Ironically, Judges Matter, a website which provides information on present and future judges, quotes Vally as saying that one never knows how these decisions are made in respect of who is allowed to act as a judge; usually a helpful perquisite in getting onto the bench.The site goes on to report that Vally did not have an easy time with the Judicial Service Commission during his interview. One has no doubt that, like president Mbeki before him, President Zuma will not hesitate in respecting, as he has done before, the court decision.What we have to question is whether the constitutional democracy that allows for all of these decisions, even in times against the wishes of the people, is what South Africans agree is the covenant that bides us altogether.A question that social commentators, and certainly those in academia, should be reflecting on is whether this document, which is meant to unite all of us, has resonance in the lives of the majority of South Africans or whether it speaks more to the compact made by the elites during the early 90s elites that we saw participating again in recent days in the national dialogue initiative .Twenty-three years after democracy, we must be able to have a conversation in this country as to whether the Constitution itself, as a binding document, has effected real change in the lives of those who continue to suffer the injustices of the past.For just like lawyers and dare we suggest judges, must be pointed out for their melancholy which is politic, so too we must ensure that interrogating our constitutional dispensation never becomes a taboo.Wesley SealeWesley Seale teaches politics and international studies at Rhodes University
