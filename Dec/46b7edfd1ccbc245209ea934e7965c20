The Hawks on Wednesday swopped in to seize assets worth a whopping R460 million allegedly defrauded from a Midrand based medical equipment company’s coffers by a former employee. The afternoon raid took place in Boksburg, East of Johannesburg. The 43-year-old old woman worked as an accountant at the company and allegedly defrauded the company by depositing money into her deceased husband’s bank account. It is alleged she would doctor service provider invoices by inflating the amounts, in
some cases by 100%, after which she would pay the service provider what they charge and keep the rest. The woman was before the raid summoned from the Sun City luxury resort by the Hawks who informed her that they have a warrant for her arrest and to search her property. Hawks spokesperson Ndivhuwo Mulamu said a representative of the company and the company’s current accountant opened a case of fraud at Midrand police station when they could not recognise a credit provider on their database. “We were then notified that there was a bigger case and we started our investigations in October. During our investigations we found that the woman had diverted funds of the company by duplicating creditors amounts, paying it into her former husband’s account
who died after shooting himself,” Mulamu said. During the seizure, her jewellery worth R12m, 11 luxury cars including Range Rovers and seven immovable properties were attached by the Hawks. According to reports, the Boksburg home is only one of a number of properties that are still to be searched. It is believed that the woman, who worked for the company for 13 years, started stealing the money when she was 30 years old. One of her houses attached has a beauty parlour, gym and has at least seven employees working for her. -TNA Reporter additional reporting SHONISANI TSHIKALANGE
