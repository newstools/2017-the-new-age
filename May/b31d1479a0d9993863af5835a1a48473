Drake proved his dominance of the music industry once again by winning a record 13 Billboard Music Awards.The music magazine&#8217;s televised gala in Las Vegas hands out awards based on the year&#8217;s chart performances, leaving little suspense about who will end the night well &#8212; unlike the more prestigious Grammys, which are based on voting by music professionals.Drake &#8212; the Toronto hip-hop star who has commanded the charts with a string of catchy hits including &#8220;One Dance,&#8221; &#8220;Hotline Bling&#8221; and &#8220;Fake Love&#8221; &#8212; edged out the record of the English balladeer Adele, who won 12 awards in 2012 in the wake of her breakthrough song &#8220;Someone Like You.&#8221;Taking the stage, Drake offered an analogy that could have come from a vulgar Forrest Gump.&#8220;Life is like a roll of toilet paper. You&#8217;re either on a roll or taking&#8230;&#8221; he said, before his choice words were bleeped out on ABC television.With the low drama over who will win prizes, the Billboard gala instead offers musicians a wide television audience months after the US entertainment industry&#8217;s awards season.Cher &#8212; presented with the Icon Award for lifetime achievement &#8212; took to heart the title of her 1989 hit &#8220;If I Could Turn Back Time,&#8221; singing it in a black fishnet suit and leather jacket as in the original video.The look came as a surprise to the crowd as Cher &#8212; who turned 71 the day before &#8212; had quickly changed after singing her hit &#8220;Believe,&#8221; which she performed in a platinum wig, high heels and a skimpy dress of necklace-like loops that revealed her skin-baring bra.Cher thanked her late musical and romantic partner Sonny Bono in a speech, resisting the opportunity to talk politics, even though she is an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump.Nicki Minaj opened the show with a nearly 10-minute hit medley as she sported a bondage-inspired suit of spikes and cuffs, while Celine Dion marked the 20th anniversary of the Hollywood blockbuster &#8220;Titanic&#8221; by singing its theme &#8220;My Heart Will Go On.&#8221;Miley Cyrus sang her new song &#8220;Malibu,&#8221; a mid-tempo, jam-rock ballad about kindling love on the beach that marks a more mature sound for the former child star famous for her brazen sexuality.&#8220;For the first time with pants on in years!&#8221; her sister Noah Cyrus said as she introduced Miley, who came out in jean-shorts.-AFP
