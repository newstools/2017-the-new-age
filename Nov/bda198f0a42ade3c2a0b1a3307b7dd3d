Nelson Mandela Bay Executive Mayor Athol Trollip faces a motion of no confidence today. Patriotic Alliance (PA) councilor Marlon Daniels brought forward the motion, calling for the removal of Trollip and council speaker Jonathan Lawack. The DA is currently ruling the Nelson Mandela Bay municipality through a coalition with other smaller parties. In August, the UDM’s Mongameli Bobani was removed as Trollip’s deputy through a motion of no confidence. Bobani has on several occasions tried unsuccessfully to overturn his removal in court. Earlier today, EFF Deputy President Floyd Shivambu announced on Twitter that the EFF would not support any no confidence motions brought forward in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Nelson Mandela Bay. Provincial DA spokesperson Mlindi Nhanha said there have been noticeable changes in the metro since Trollip took over. Nhanha said it was very difficult for some parties to accept that the DA was in charge and doing well. “The ANC cannot allow DA-led coalition successes in Nelson Mandela Bay to spread to other parts of the Eastern Cape,” Nhanha said. He said the DA would continue to fight corruption and create jobs for residents. -TNA Reporter
