Thousands of female pupils in KwaZulu-Natal will not be missing out on school any more during their monthly menstrual cycle as the department of education in KwaZulu-Natal will be distributing sanitary towels to schools.The department plans to distribute free sanitary pads to 2 992 schools in the province in an effort to reduce the dropout rate among girls.KZN education spokesperson Muzi Mahlambi, said that the decision to rollout sanitary towels was taken after it found that girls from poor households, who cannot afford sanitary towels, miss out on about 36 days or more of schooling annually due to absenteeism when it is that time of the month. This initiative will tackle one of the issues that has contributed greatly to the school dropout rate in girls. Imagine losing 36 or so days of school, that is a lot. It is also very difficult for these girls to catch up on school work as they are often away from school for seven days on average depending on how long their periods last, Mahlambi said.In a recent circular, the department said four packs per pupil will be distributed to schools in lower income communities (quantile 1-4) by the end of January.The principal of each school will be responsible for the distribution to pupils in grades 4 to 12.Nontokozo Gxumisa
