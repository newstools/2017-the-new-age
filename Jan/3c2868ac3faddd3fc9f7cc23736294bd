The North West provincial government could reduce the salaries of senior employees as part of continued efforts to scale down on expenditure during the course of 2017.The New Age has established that the issue came under the spotlight during deliberations of the provincial executive committee (Exco) late last year and will be taken up further when the body resumes its meetings.Such a development comes hard on the heels of the decision by President Jacob Zuma to accept a recommendation by the independent Commission for the Remuneration of Public Office Bearers against increasing the salaries of most senior government employees in light of the country s challenging economic environment.In line with this recommendation, only municipal councillors and members of the national House of Traditional Leaders will get a salary increase of not more than 6%.However, the salaries of the presidium as well as that of mayors, members of Parliament, whips and other top officials will remain unchanged.The cost-cutting move will now have a cascading effect with North West provincial government spokesperson, Brian Setswambung, revealing that salary reductions for senior officials are definitely on the cards .He said the provincial Exco would convene for their first meeting of 2017 before the end of this month. Obviously, in line with the economic climate that the country is in, there are likely to be some salary reductions. This subject has been discussed but we do not have the figures at this stage, Setswambung said. During his final address last year, the premier emphasised the need for public servants to work harder and put the needs of the people first. Some of these financial decisions are, therefore, a result of his desire to improve the lives of people in this province. Last year, the provincial government did not receive a favourable report from the auditor-general, who noted the R2.9bn irregular expenditure as one of the anomalies of the Supra Mahumapelo-led administration.Reports highlighting plans by the provincial government to purchase a private aircraft for the premier also raised questions about the commitment of the administration to cut spending.However, Setswambung said the reports were a distortion of the government s intention to invest in an aircraft for commercial purposes .DAVID SITHOLE
