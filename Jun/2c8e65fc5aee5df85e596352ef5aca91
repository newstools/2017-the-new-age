US President Donald Trump has told his top diplomat to ignore trouble in Washington and re-engage with Russia to rebuild ties, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Tuesday.With ex-FBI director James Comey due to testify to Congress on Thursday, Tillerson was asked if he feared the adminstration would be brought down over allegations of Trump&#8217;s election campaign ties with Moscow.&#8220;The president has been clear to me, &#8216;Do not let what&#8217;s happening over here in the political realm prevent you from the work you need to do in this relationship&#8217;,&#8221; he told reporters in New Zealand.Comey&#8217;s testimony will be his first public remarks since being fired by Trump last month, and represents a moment of danger for the embattled president.His sacking came as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) probes possible collusion between Trump&#8217;s election campaign team and Russia &#8212; which US intelligence believes hoped to tilt the election in the Republican&#8217;s favor.Tillerson said he could not comment on the investigations into Russian ties and was &#8220;really &#8230; not involved in any of these other issues&#8221;.But he added: &#8220;The president has been very clear with me that Russia is an important global player and today our relationships with Russia are at a very low point and they&#8217;ve been deteriorating.&#8220;So the president asked me to begin a re-engagement process with Russia to stabilise that relationship so it does not deteriorate further.&#8221;Trump wanted him to &#8220;identify areas of mutual interest where perhaps we can build some level of trust and confidence so that there are areas where we can work together&#8221;.&#8220;And that&#8217;s the process that&#8217;s under way today,&#8221; Tillerson said.&#8220;He&#8217;s been quite clear with me to proceed at whatever pace and in whatever areas we might make progress.&#8221;Tillerson met New Zealand Prime Minister Bill English and Foreign Minister Gerry Brownlee on Tuesday after stopovers in Australia and Singapore.-AFP
