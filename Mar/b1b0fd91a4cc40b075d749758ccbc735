Thousands of mourners among them fans, friends, television and film industry peers and colleagues, gathered at the Soweto University of Johannesburg campus to pay their last respects to acting legend Joe Mafela, who was yesterday laid to rest at Heroes Acre in West Park Cemetery.Among those who attended included Minister of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa, deputy Rejoice Mabudafhasi, MEC of sport and recreation Faith Mazibuko, Deputy Minister in the Office of the President Buti Manamela and showbiz stalwarts Mary Twala, Abigail Kubeka, poet Don Mattera, Lillian Dube and many others.In keeping up with Mafela s heritage, a traditional Tshivenda ceremony was performed outside the hall, followed by his casket being led in by two men riding white horses.Family spokesperson Millicent Mulelu, thanked the acting fraternity and dignitaries among them, Swazi royal family and the ministers for supporting the family through the mourning period. We are humbled by the support from the pastors, the ministers, the actors and all those who came to mourn with us, she said.Addressing the mourners, Mthethwa described Mafela as an icon who inspired laughter where there could have been tears . He held us in his thrall to liberate us. In his acting we recognised ourselves, people we knew and what it means to be South African. He had a creative vision, which he shared with us in many different ways through his varied roles over five decades as an actor, musician, playwright, producer, director, advertising director and co-owner of a film company, Mthethwa said.Speaking to The New Age as scores of mourners joined in song and dance during the service, Generations actress Thando Thabethe, said she was honoured to have worked with a legend as big and humble as Mafela on the SABC1 soapie. If there is one thing I have learnt from bra Joe, is that you need to be humble. He never acted like the legend that he was. He was accommodating to everyone on set and I can tell you that he was a sweet and silly old man. I shall forever be grateful for the opportunity of sharing the same set as him, she said.The 75-year-old acting legend died more than a week ago in a car crash on the M1 highway in Johannesburg. After the service, the procession made its way from Soweto to West Park Cemetery where the Mafela family unveiled a large tombstone for the late actor.At Heroes Acre, the award-winning actor is joined by other luminaries and personalities such as kwaito star Mandoza, race car driver Gugu Zulu, Eddie Zondi and Vuyo Mbuli.The actor was buried moments after struggle icon Ahmed Kathrada who died on Tuesday following a short illness resulting from recent brain surgery.SIYABONGA SITHOLEsiyabongas@thenewage.co.za
