US President Donald Trump on Thursday conceded that Russia may have interfered in the 2016 election that brought him to power but said other countries may also have been involved.&#8220;I&#8217;ve said it very simply. I think it could very well have been Russia. I think it could well have been other countries. I won&#8217;t be specific. But I think a lot of people interfere,&#8221; Trump said during a visit to Warsaw.-AFP
