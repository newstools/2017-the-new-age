Avast, the company behind the leading antivirus software, warned Thursday against attacks on home appliances connected to the internet, calling hackers targeting home routers a major threat to consumers.&#8220;It&#8217;s a trivial thing to do and there&#8217;s nothing the user can do to fix it, other than to throw the router away and put in a new router,&#8221; Avast chief executive Vincent Steckler told reporters.Avast chief technology officer Ondrej Vlcek said that more and more people were using internet-enabled appliances which he described as &#8220;a total nightmare when it comes to security&#8221;.Vulnerable appliances include TV sets, audio systems, coffee machines and toys, according to the Prague-based company, which every month registers 444 million users and prevents 3.5 billion malware attacks and 500 million visits to harmful websites.In February, London police arrested a Briton suspected of staging a cyberattack on household routers run by Deutsche Telekom in November 2016, which knocked an estimated million German households offline.Steckler said his company had hacked into a router at a recent show in the United States to demonstrate the harm such attacks can do.Avast changed the router&#8217;s firmware, took control of a TV set and made it play a Barack Obama speech over and over.&#8221;Even if you turn off the TV, the router turns the TV back on and the user can&#8217;t see anything other than the Obama speech,&#8221; Steckler said, adding that the hacker could then hold the TV for ransom.&#8220;I know most people, especially Americans, care much more about their TV than they do about their data. They&#8217;d probably be much more willing to pay ransom for it,&#8221; he said, chuckling.Internet security became a hot topic last Friday when a ransomware attack hit more than 300,000 computers worldwide, affecting the likes of Britain&#8217;s National Health Service, US package delivery giant FedEx and Germany&#8217;s Deutsche Bahn rail network.-AFP
