Azerbaijan-based Dino Ndlovu would be justified in feeling hard done by at being overlooked for the latest Bafana Bafana squad. In distant south-eastern Europe, Ndlovu is not really dining at one of Europe s top tables, playing for Qarabag in the Azerbaijan Premier League.But having had a pretty successful season in which he scored 14 goals and helped his team clinch the league championship, Ndlovu would have rightly expected a lookin by new coach Stuart Baxter. That hasn t been the case after Baxter, who lamented the lack of prolific strikers at his disposal, seemingly had other ideas. I think the options we ve chosen, if you put the balance of the team together, are better than Dino at the moment, Baxter said. But I ll be checking his progress and I might even go there to see him play if he continues to get rave reviews or scores a lot of goals. At this moment, though, it s too quick to say he s not in the national team because of what he has done in Azerbaijan. And part of it is that Azerbaijan and Italy are not the same.And I ve got to be honest when I say that because scoring a hat-trick in Finland is different to scoring a hat-trick in the Premier League. But if he continues in his form then I ll be monitoring him closely. He might force himself into the mix. -KGOMOTSO SETHUSHA|kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
