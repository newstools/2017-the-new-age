Fourteen teenage school girls in Malawi on Tuesday launched a legal challenge against a controversial court decision to punish them over pregnancies, including jailing some of the girls&#8217; parents.In April 2016, a primary school in Nkhata Bay on the shores of Lake Malawi gave one-year suspensions to several students aged 13 and 14.The boys who impregnated them were also suspended.The girls were also referred to a magistrate court which fined each of them 10,000 kwacha ($14).Students who failed to pay were imprisoned, along with their parents, and were freed only after paying the fine.&#8220;We are asking for a review of the strange orders imposed by a lower court that all pregnant girls be sent to prison,&#8221; Victor Gondwe, a lawyer representing the girls and their parents, told AFP.He said it was &#8220;quite strange and awkward to criminalise pregnancy.&#8221;&#8220;You don&#8217;t get imprisoned for the acts of others,&#8221; the lawyer said by telephone from the northern town of Mzuzu, the nearest to Nkhata Bay, where the High Court heard the case.Laws in Malawi, a deeply impoverished country, stipulate that pregnant school girls be suspended from classes for one year.-AFP
