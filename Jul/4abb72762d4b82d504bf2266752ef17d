At least 15 people died Wednesday in a huge shootout between police and two rival drug gangs in northern Mexico, authorities said.The pre-dawn battle near the remote town of Las Varas started as a firefight between rival drug trafficking gangs, then escalated when police arrived, said Eduardo Esparza of the prosecutor&#8217;s office for the state of Chihuahua, which borders the United States.The region is hotly disputed territory for Mexico&#8217;s drug cartels because its mountainous terrain and proximity to the border make it a strategic corridor for shipping narcotics to the US.Investigators believe the groups involved in the shootout were &#8220;La Linea&#8221; &#8212; the armed wing of the Juarez cartel &#8212; and hitmen from the powerful Sinaloa cartel, Esparza told AFP.Fifteen people died &#8212; all from the drug gangs &#8212; and five more were arrested, state police chief Oscar Aparicio told Radio Formula.It was the latest in a series of deadly clashes between police, rival drug gangs and warring factions within the Sinaloa cartel, which has been in turmoil since its kingpin, Joaquin &#8220;El Chapo&#8221; Guzman, was extradited to the United States in January.Last Friday, 17 gunmen were killed in a spectacular shootout with police on a highway in Sinaloa, the northwestern state that is the Guzman cartel&#8217;s home base.May was the deadliest month in Mexico since the government began keeping track in 1997, with 2,186 homicides.-AFP
