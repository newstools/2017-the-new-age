Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure has criticised fellow footballers who have traded Europe for China, saying he would prefer to follow Manchester United forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic&#8217;s example and stay in a competitive league.Chinese Super League clubs have made a number of high-profile recent signings recently, with Shanghai SIPG buying Brazil midfielder Oscar from Chelsea for 60 million euros ($64.46 million).Their rivals Shanghai Shenhua signed Argentine striker Carlos Tevez for a reported 84 million euros, but Toure said money was not everything to him.&#8220;Do you play football because you love football or do you play because you want to make money? Me, I just want to play football because I enjoy it,&#8221; he told British media.&#8221;Some people have the mentality that they want to do that (go to China) &#8211; to try something different. But for me, my feeling is that I want to play more football.&#8220;Look at my friend Ibrahimovic. He&#8217;s 35 and he&#8217;s going to play for maybe three more years? He&#8217;s got the same mentality as me. He&#8217;s a big player, a champion who loves football. It&#8217;s football first. Anything after that is a bonus.&#8221;Toure, who is out of contract in June, was frozen out of City&#8217;s squad earlier this season following a spat between the manager Pep Guardiola and the player&#8217;s agent, but returned to the team in November after making a public apology.He has featured regularly ever since, but there is no official word yet on whether he will be offered a new contract at City. His agent revealed last week that he had turned down a 520,000 pounds ($648,900) a week offer to play in China.&#8220;I want to play in Europe, especially in England. I want to continue doing that for a few years yet. I always say that if I went to China I would end up feeling angry there,&#8221; the 33-year-old added.-REUTERS
