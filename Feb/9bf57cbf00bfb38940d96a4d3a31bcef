THE community of Sonop in Namaqualand in the Northern Cape are victims of seeping sewage from a dysfunctional sewerage plant. They said for the past two years nothing has been done to remedy the problem. It also spills into the little Schaapriver which in return flows into the Buffelsriver, which supplies water to communities through boreholes. Residents from Sonop, the nearby suburb, are up in arms, fearing for their health. They are accusing the Nama-Khoi municipality of not being responsive to their problem. They said the unhygienic situation in the area is a threat to their health. A concerned parent of the Sonop community said the situation is particularly dire for their children. Our children play in that water and you can t get them away from it. Our livestock, which we slaughter to eat, drink that water. It s not healthy at all, a concerned parent said. AfriForum in Namaqualand said they repeatedly reported this issue since 2015 to the Nama Khoi municipality with no favourable response. Chairperson of Afri-forum, Sarel Stone said: We also went as far as to lodge a criminal case with the police in Springbok regarding the sewage spill as well as the one in Carolusberg and at Steinkopf. This water flows into the Schaapriver which flows into the Buffelsriver and from there to Kleinzee into the Atlantic Ocean. The Nama Khoi municipality said financial constraints and outdated infrastructure is the root of the problem. However, short and long term plans to solve the problem is on the cards. Nama Khoi technical services Jacques Cloete said: Because the costs to refurbish the plant are so high, I advised the council to look at a different type of technology which will be the construction of sewerage dams in which the water will be purified through natural processes. In the meantime the sewerage flows freely and if remedial action is not taken soon, nature and the surrounding communities will suffer more damage and looming disease. SABC
