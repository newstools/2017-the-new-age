The ANC released a slew of policy discussion documents that detail wide-ranging changes to the way leaders are elected, land and economic reform, education, health and social security policy. The documents, which ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa called a festival of ideas , will form the basis of debate and discussion at branches and other fora ahead of the National Policy Conference at the end of June &#8211; which ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa called a festival of ideas . Jeff Radebe said the documents reflected concerns within the party and he said the ANC was looking forward to wide-ranging discussions, highlighting divergent views and intense debate on its policy proposals and we trust that the organisation and the nation will emerge from this process with a united, common vision of our country s developmental trajectory. While, Radebe said, South Africa was a better place to live in 2017 the documents acknowledges that the conditions under which the ANC operates have changed. The paper further acknowledges that the ANC s own internal challenges, such as social distance between leaders and members, widespread corruption, poor performance in government and abuse of organizational processes for personal gain, will contribute to the ANC s demise if left unattended, Radebe said and it was essential that win back the trust of the people . Among the discussion proposals are the following: Some of the organisation s best cadres must remain in the ANC on a full-time basis; Revolutionary Electoral Commission to effectively deal with issues of gatekeeping and manipulation of electoral processes; The paper also proposes that the organisation reviews its nomination and electoral processes to allow for open contestation but open contestation must be informed by guidelines and transparency; A massive increase in youth access to vocational training and apprenticeship programmes in combination with public service youth brigades; Infrastructure programmes and municipal programmes must include set asides for labour-based work programmes; Provide greater certainty by codifying the constitutional requirement of just and equitable compensation for the acquisition of land where the land has been legally acquired, where it is illegal no compensation; A targeted programme to assist black entrepreneurs in setting up small businesses and cooperatives; Improvement in the quality of education, health services and public transport. In addition, the communications discussion document notes that convergence amongst the dominant media houses continue to entrench editorial positions that seem resistant to the National Democratic Revolution , government programmes and the ANC as leader of society&#8221;. It was suggested that the ANC should look to other media, community media among these, as an outlet for its messages. The proposals included nation-building and social cohesion through, amongst others, continuing to highlight the contribution of arts, heritage and culture.
