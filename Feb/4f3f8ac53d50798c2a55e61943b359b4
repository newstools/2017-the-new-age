Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula has denied a CAF statement that President Jacob Zuma was backing Issa Hayatou in the upcoming presidential election.Hayatou, who is seeking an eighth term as leader of African football, met with Zuma on a courtesy visit to his Pretoria residence at the weekend.The continent s football governing body claimed Zuma reiterated his commitment and that of his government to Hayatou, endorsing his candidacy for a next term at the helm of CAF.But Mbalula yesterday moved to clarify that Zuma wished Hayatou well as he would to other candidates. Abiding by the principle of noninterference in the affairs of football democracy, President Jacob Zuma did not pledge his personal support behind the name of Hayatou, Mbalula said.Kgomotso Sethusha
