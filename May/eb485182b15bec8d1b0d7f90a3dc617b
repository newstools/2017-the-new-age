The application by the former Hawks boss Berning Ntlemeza to interdict Police Minister Fikile Mbalula from preventing him doing his work has been struck of the roll, with the Gauteng North judge Sheila Mphahlele handing down a decision that there was nothing making his application urgent.Mphahlela has instead ordered Ntlemeza to pay the costs. While delivering her judgement, Mphahlele said former Hawks boss lacked integrity, a trait that permanently disqualified him from holding the post. The court noted that the applicant s lack of integrity permanently disqualified him from holding the post, the judge said. She further ruled that the matter was not urgent. Ntlemeza brought the matter to the court seeking to interdict Mbalula from preventing him to assume his position as head of the Hawks.Yesterday Ntlemeza sought to interdict Mbalula from firing him after the court had previously ruled that he be dismissed.At the same time Mphahlele said the court was not competent to discuss the enforcement order that was before her court, adding that Ntlemeza s contention was clearly misguided.-Sipho Jack
