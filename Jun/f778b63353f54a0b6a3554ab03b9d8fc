Faced with the need to incorporate work integrated learning into the physical education curriculum and addressing the demand for trained teachers in the subject at schools, the Department of Higher Education and Training, teamed up with the Department of Sports and Recreation to address both.The two ministries have launched a graduate placement programme for students involved in physical education and sports training at four TVET colleges in KwaZulu-Natal.Under this programme, students are placed at schools for workplace learning while filling the void of qualified physical education teachers at schools in the province.A pilot programme involving 160 students is under way.On completion, the students chosen from various sporting codes will be accredited by the Culture, Arts, Tourism, Hospitality and Sport Education and Training Authority.The seta, along with the National Skills Fund is financing the programme.Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande said the programme was a significant milestone to skills development, improvement of the basic education system through better qualified teachers and the general health of the population. Physical education has long been something of an orphan when it comes to many of our schools away from the more competitive centres where our best national team players are produced. So when we asked ourselves how it might be possible to mobilise the real talent of our young people, how we could ensure that ever more kids could be given the opportunity to go for gold, either in local competition or internationally, we quickly realised that skilled coaches and trainers would be key, Nzimande said. The top schools have of course always understood this, which is why so many of our best cricket and rugby players come from just a handful of institutions across the country.Soccer, netball and athletics are again an altogether different story, but it shouldn t be. Youth coaches in schools could and must in future make a big difference not only to the quality, but also to the discipline and team spirit of our players. Nzimande s strategic intent with the pilot programme is to ensure further integration and cooperation between the TVETs and the courses already offered by some universities in the province.He said the department s task was to ensure the alignment of these programmes with each other and the National Qualifications Framework. As a first step, we celebrate the 160 students on the pilot programme. Interestingly, more than 50% are women, indicating this is also about empowering all of our people he said.Referencing that the May, 2014, basic education ministerial task team report on physical education and life orientation, Skills Development Institute for Physical Education acting CEO, Mduduzi Madlala, said there was an urgent need for the skills offered by the TVETs under the pilot programme.The report showed that pupils health and well-being were at risk, as untrained teachers were all too often offering physical activities without any credentials or training in physical education. In addition, the National Sport and Recreation Plan recognises that there is a need to ensure physical education and sport are incorporated into the teacher training curriculum to overcome the shortage of teachers with the necessary qualifications. While the movement studies outcome is a compulsory focus area, many teachers still do not feel confident to teach and assess it, that is why we launched this programme to produce specialist sports and physical education coaches, Madlala said.LESLEY TSHAMANOprovinces@thenewage.co.za
