Ambitious, diverse, patient and persistent.These are a set of many positive adjectives that define the character of journalist-turned entrepreneur Sol Motsepe, the CEO of Mega Food Supplies and chairperson of Radisol Group.Born in Mmakau near GaRankuwa, Pretoria, the soft-spoken and meticulous Motsepe recalls how he once shared his grandfather s three-roomed mud house with 15 family members and often lived on handouts from generous people.However, at a very young age, Motsepe knew that this was not the life he was destined to live, he was born to live a better life.Hence he declared early in life that hard work, persistence and determination would change the course of his life. This early pronouncement saw Motsepe steadily crafting his path to become a prosperous and respectable human being.Today Motsepe owns a number of flourishing businesses which include Mega Food Supplies. He has a majority shareholding of 51% in Mega Food Supplies, which has offices in Germiston and Durban.The company imports and exports a wide range of fresh, chilled and frozen food products such as chicken, red meat, fish, vegetables, French fries, processed meats and value-added potatoes to big and small companies throughout South Africa.He runs Radisol Group with his wife Evodia from their modest Centurion offices. The company is active in residential and commercial property management and development, agroprocessing, distribution and retail and has a hand in the import and export business.Motsepe also has majority shares in Lineprop, an information technology and property investment company based in Pretoria.He is a partner with well-known sports personalities and veteran journalist Thomas Kwenaite in a production company, TK Media &amp; TV Production.Before deciding to go it alone, Motsepe spent more than 20 years in senior and executive level positions at the Department of Cooperative Governance and at big brands such as Royal Bafokeng Administration (RBA), Murray &amp; Roberts Engineering Solutions, Statistics South Africa (StatsSA) and BHP Billiton.He heads as non-executive chairperson various companies which include Rightscope Academy, Radisol Foods, Innercircle, Kingsol International and Lineprop.Motsepe, who regards himself as a multi-skilled professional with well-developed, proven leadership and senior executive management abilities spanning more than 20 years, said it was not easy establishing and sustaining the businesses.His ability to apply critical thinking in the main areas of business, improve interpersonal relations, apply good governance, management openness, fairness principles and best practice to business and understand macro- and micro-economic issues have helped to give him a breakthrough.Motsepe has extensive experience and background in the poultry, building and construction, engineering, mining and energy, property and manufacturing industry as well as a practical knowledge of journalism and marketing communications.And he is a recognised and respected thought leader in his respective fields. Understanding the complexities surrounding supply chain processes is a critical element in maximising corporate efficiency, Motsepe said. In all our businesses, we strive to provide detailed analysis of the entire chain from downstream supplier and sourcing process to upstream end-user requirements and successfully incorporate solutions and recommendations that will support highly efficient and streamlined processes within our supply chain. We therefore offer complete logistics solutions to customers and are able to cover all aspects of handling, marketing, accounting and distribution of products. He acknowledged that he has made poor decisions in life which included choosing poor quality of friends and business partners. He however emphasised that collaborations and partnership networks are some of the elements that create new doors of opportunity. In all my business dealings, I m always committed to upholding high ethical standards and honesty, dealing fairly with clients and stakeholders and executing my work with distinction, Motsepe said.They have a team of dedicated professionals who work with their clients and customers to create high-impact campaigns that fit business goals by providing stellar service and creative solutions.Motsepe s career as a journalist started in earnest when the late Aggrey Klaaste and former editor Joe Latakgomo offered him an opportunity to write a youth column for the Sowetan newspaper while he was in Standard 9 (Grade 11 today) at Rantailane High School in GaRankuwa where he met his wife.The weekly column addressed issues of morality among the youth, including encouraging them to respect and honour their elders. After completing matric, he was invited to join the newspaper as a sports writer. I think I can be likened to Bobby Motaung. I got my job at the Sowetan without a CV, he said with a wry smile.After getting bored with writing about Kaizer Chiefs, Orlando Pirates and others, he was recruited by Percy Qoboza to join City Press as a news journalist. Thereafter he became one of the youngest editors when he was given rare opportunities to edit Jive magazine and Motoring News International.He left the media in 1994 after pressure from his wife to get a reasonably paying job. We were grossly underpaid. Evenwhen I was the editor of Jive and Motoring News, I could not afford my small family, Motsepe said. I gave it all up as I could not eat the by-line that went with every story that I wrote. This was also given more sense and weight because at one of his editorial meetings, the late Klaaste once said those harbouring thoughts of one day being millionaires should forget the dream as it would never happen while one continued working as a journalist.He followed his wife s advice and abandoned Motoring News to join Transnet in 1994 where he was paid five times more .His move to Transnet and Telkom encouraged some journalists to follow suit into the corporate and government environment.This has now become a norm for journalists to begin their careers in the print media industry and later move into the government sector, mining, telecommunications and other corporate sectors as spin doctors and heads of communication.He has, however, recently authored two Christian books, Faith Hope &amp; Love as well as Forgive, which were published and printed in the US, UK and Australia.The books are distributed to more than 39000 stores worldwide. In spite of his extremely busy schedule, Motsepe has a handful of other Christian and academic manuscripts which he hopes to publish before the end of the year.Motsepe said his never-ending demand to participate in the corporate structures of various companies is as a result of being highly competent in strategy and policy development, implementation and enforcement, public and private sector liaison across all spheres, people management and empowerment, resource, project and human capital management.He also has a thorough knowledge of the public service regulatory framework and government programmes and priorities, including financial knowledge and information management and communications (written and oral).His qualifications and background also count in his favour.Motsepe has a master of business administration (MBA) degree, executive development programme (EDP), diploma in public relations and communications, certificate in public relations management, management advancement programme (MAP) and a certificate in corporate governance for directors.He recently underwent import and export training in Atlanta and Washington in the US.Motsepe has represented his previous companies at strategic meetings including having one-on-one engagements with the South African president, several Cabinet ministers, MPs, premiers, senior government officials, civic associations and civil society as well as organised business and labour.He has also presented papers and speeches at major international conferences and meetings across the globe.His ambition is to grow his businesses and leave a lasting legacy for his two boys, Tlotlang and Ororiseng and his teenage daughter Princess Rearabilwe.He also wants to work towards the empowerment of underprivileged youth in rural areas. I know how it is to live in poverty, go to school barefoot, live on handouts and be ridiculed by peers and adults alike. It destroys your soul, it breaks your confidence and willingness to live, Motsepe said. Even when you are out of poverty, some people still associate you with it. The little contribution I can make towards restoring, protecting and upholding the well-being of the rural youth in future, will make me fulfilled. To this end, Motsepe has established Radisol Foundation to help empower the youth from his home village and elsewhere in the North West province to complete their studies. The foundation, which was established early this year, has enlisted 20 boys and girls so far.Motsepe said he has superficial bruises and wounds from the persecution, pain and strife he had to endure in his social and business life. It was not easy to get where we are. It was through grit and determination. You need to push and push until something happens. He said most businesses fail because most people are not willing to work hard and be persistent. They want to get rich quick but do not want to make the necessary sacrifices, to prioritise and be patient. Motsepe cited a hard example on prioritisation. When SA was under the spell of the Fifa World Cup in 2010, he had to prioritise acquiring his MBA rather than watching football.All that has paid off. Motsepe is now sitting pretty among some of South African s elite residential golf estates in Gauteng with top businessmen, politicians, celebrities and other luminaries.But he has a respectful disposition because he always remembers where he comes from.SELLO RABOTHATHAsellor@thenewage.co.za
