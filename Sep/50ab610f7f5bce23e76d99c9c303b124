South Africa coach Allister Coetzee has made three changes to the starting line-up as his team face their &#8220;ultimate test&#8221; against New Zealand in Auckland on Saturday.Two of the changes for the Rugby Championship fourth-round clash were injury enforced, with flanker Jean-Luc du Preez coming in for Jaco Kriel and prop Ruan Dreyer replacing Coenie Oosthuizen.Kriel (shoulder) and Oosthuizen (broken arm) were both hurt in last week&#8217;s nail-biting 23-23 draw against the Wallabies in Perth.Coetzee also welcomes back lock Franco Mostert, who was rested against Australia but relegates Pieter-Steph du Toit to the bench for the All Blacks match.&#8220;Franco had five superb matches before he was rested last week, he is refreshed again and I expect another strong performance from him as his high work-rate is much needed,&#8221; the coach said.Coetzee described the North Harbour Stadium contest as the ultimate test for the Springboks, who are the only unbeaten international team in 2017 after six Tests.&#8221;They are the number one side in the world both in rankings and experience and there is no greater contest than to play them in New Zealand,&#8221; he said.&#8220;The rivalry between the two sides is filled with rich history and on Saturday we get an opportunity to be part of that.&#8221;They are always at their best when playing the Springboks and we are expecting another huge battle.&#8221;South Africa (15-1): Andries Coetzee; Raymond Rhule, Jesse Kriel, Jan Serfontein, Courtnall Skosan; Elton Jantjies, Ross Cronje; Uzair Cassiem, Jean-Luc du Preez, Siya Kolisi; Franco Mostert, Eben Etzebeth (capt); Ruan Dreyer, Malcolm Marx, Tendai Mtawarira.Replacements: Bongi Mbonambi, Steven Kitshoff, Trevor Nyakane, Lood de Jager, Pieter-Steph du Toit, Francois Hougaard, Handre Pollard, Damian de Allende.-AFP
