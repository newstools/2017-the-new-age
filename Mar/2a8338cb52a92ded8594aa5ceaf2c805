The police acted hastily in announcing they had nabbed three suspects in connection with the 15 computers stolen at the Office of the Chief Justice on Saturday, an expert said.Two suspects, Bigboy Yose and Given Msimango, appeared in court on Wednesday but were not charged with the burglary. Instead, their charges included possession of stolen goods, fake IDs, as well as unlicensed firearms.The third suspect, Joshua Msimango, had his case withdrawn yesterday after the state refused to prosecute him because of a lack of evidence.Gareth Newham of the Institute of Security Studies blamed the hasty announcement on the immense political and public pressure on the police following this burglary. Immense pressure was put on the police to solve this case and that pressure meant that they might have acted too hastily in an attempt to show politicians and the public that they were making progress and trying their best to solve the case, Newham said.He said the police should call press conferences and claim victories only when they are certain they have watertight cases against suspects.The trio s lawyer, Sammy Mahlangu, said there was nothing in the charge sheet that pointed the burglary to his clients.Acting national police commissioner Lt-Gen Khomotso Phahlane on Wednesday said they were calling upon Nkosinathi Msimango, who has valuable information, to come forward.Police spokesperson Brig Sally De Beer said Msimango was yet to come forward.Msimango is the brother of Joshua and Given.mtokozisid@thenewage.co.za
