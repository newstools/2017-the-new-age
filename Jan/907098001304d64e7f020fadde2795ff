The terrorism case against the twins, Brandon-Lee and Tony-Lee Thulsie, was postponed to Friday for legal argument.The twins appeared in the Johannesburg Magistrate s Court where yet another attempt by them to secure failed.Yesterday Magistrate Du Plessis agreed to the state s request for postponement, but insisted that their heads of argument be ready for presentation in court by Friday.The court heard that there may be a link between the terror case of the Thulsie brothers and the two suspects arrested in Kenya and Britain recently for alleged terrorism.The court further heard that the US also had an interest in the case because the accused allegedly planned to bomb the country s embassy in South Africa.The state also intends to subpoena cellphone service providers to bolster its case.The twins were arrested in July during a Hawks raid in Newclare, south of Johannesburg.They were arrested in what was supposed to be a search operation but one of the cell members allegedly turned a state witness during the raid.Investigating officer WO Wynand Olivier had in the previous hearing told the court that police had been working with foreign law enforcement agencies.In 2015 , the state security agency received information from a woman who was concerned about her brother s plan to travel with two friends to Syria to join ISIS.At the time, and due to law enforcement interest in the suspects, Turkish Airlines refused them access to the flight and had to remain behind.TNA REPORTERnews@thenewage.co.za
