Orlando Pirates will be forced to play friendly matches as preparation leading up to the Nedbank Cup final against SuperSport United on June 24 at Moses Mabhida Stadium.With the PSL season concluding on Saturday, Pirates last match this season will be against hoodoo team SuperSport as they look to console themselves by winning the cup in what has been an awful campaign. Unlike SuperSport, who will be active in the CAF Confederation Cup group stage matches, Pirates will be doing nothing except training. Buccaneers coach Kjell Jonevret said the club will try to arrange friendly matches to stay active, but this could be difficult as most teams are in off-season already. We will have a few days off and when we start training we will have friendly games in two weeks time, Jonevret said. Hopefully against tough opponents at home or we travel away. We are working on that right now. I have asked for two friendly games. We hope we will be well prepared when we are in Durban next time. For the first time since the inception of the PSL in 1996, Pirates failed to finish inside the top eight after finishing the season 11th on the log standings.It is a huge disappointment for the club celebrating their 80th anniversary but they have a chance to win something in the form of the Nedbank Cup. It is important for the supporters and for the club. They wanted to have trophies this season but everything went down a little bit, Jonevret said. I know we will have a big crowd when we play in the final and we want to give them something to smile about and hopefully we will do that. SuperSport are set to take on TP Mazembe away on Sunday and at home on June 20 and would appear to have an advantage in terms of fitness. Pirates will be desperate to avenge the final defeat they suffered against SuperSport last year in the same competition.-NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
