THE city of Ekurhuleni s council has approved budget adjustments to address pressing socio-economic challenges in the area.The adjusted budget sees 700 Grade 12 pupils receiving bursaries after the city s bursary fund was increased from R10m to R100m.This has been done to ensure local matriculants get a chance to further their studies at tertiary institutions.Emerging businesses and non-government organisations stand to receive substantial financial aid since the council also increased the grant funding from R20m to R100m. We have done so because we have been to our communities. We have visited all sectors of our society and we were persuaded to attend to these urgent needs, Ekurhuleni executive mayor Mzwandile Masina said.Critical among the people s needs was the issue of land and housing. The city has 119 informal settlements.The council resolved to procure strategic land parcels in order to deliver on the commitment to build 100000 houses and 59000 service stands.This required the budget to be adjusted accordingly.The procurement of land includes various land parcels in Dalpark Extension 18, Mayfield Extension 46, Palm Ridge Extensions 10 and 12.Masina said this required R116m plus an additional R27m to complete a Sethokga family unit complex.To accelerate the delivery of social housing units an additional R44m is provided in the adjusted budget.The budget adjustment took into account the need to fast track the sewer bulk systems, which required about R31m.The mayor said the city has seen an increase in land invasions which cannot be tolerated. It would be absurd to expect the city to fold its arms in the face of pure lawlessness, which seeks to sabotage the delivery of houses to the rightful beneficiaries. We have therefore added R45m to deal with security of our land, Masina said.He said when this request was made, the city had already incurred R22m for expenses in land invasions and R26m was made available in the budget to accommodate the expenditure. The cost incurred therefore cannot be regarded as unauthorised expenditure, Masina said.He said the additional amount of R20m was granted on the basis that more land invasion cases could be identified in the current financial year and will assist the city the until the anti-land invasion unit is operational.The budget adjustment process is transparent and inclusive of all relevant parties.The process remains a vital opportunity to review priorities in line with realities on the ground. Only 15% of the population in Ekurhuleni has post-matric qualifications.NTOMBI NKOSI
