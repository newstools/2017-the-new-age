As part of celebrating the year of late struggle stalwart Oliver Reginald Tambo, the Free State provincial government will on Wednesday showcase the gains of service delivery in the province. According to provincial government, this year marks eight years since the executive council established an effective vehicle of fast-tracking service delivery to residents under the banner Operation Hlasela. “Operation Hlasela has since become a defining feature of the current administration, whose obligation continues to be that of building a caring society through the trajectory of the National Development Plan – Vision 2030, with a focus on radical economic transformation, to challenge the persistent ills of unemployment, poverty and inequality,” the provincial government said in a statement. Operation Hlasela has been instrumental in improving the old locations, infrastructure and building new offices to the so-called small town, to improve the economy. Earlier in the year, Free State Premier Ace Magashule’s spokesperson Tiisetso Makhele said the premier remained resolute in the government’s goal of decentralisation of government offices and services as a vehicle towards effective service delivery and economic development. -TNA Reporter
