The state tasked Vodacom forensic liaison manager Johanna Heyneke to plot cellphone towers in several areas and to provide cellphone data to the state. The state believes that according to the &#8220;cellphone plotting&#8221; devices, Zolani Sibeko was with alleged shooter Sizwezakhe Vumazonke, now deceased, and Nenembe, outside Jayde Panayiotou&#8217;s Stelen Glen complex in Kabega five days before she was abducted. She was forced into the boot of a vehicle and then taken to a remote area near Kwanobhule where she was murdered.Judge Dayalin Chetty yesterday accepted cellphone records as evidence against two of the accused at the Port Elizabeth High Court. This was despite Panayiotou s counsel argument that the court should not to use the recordings.It is reported that Heyneke, who until recently was called to testify in up to three cases a week, was asked by state advocate Marius Stander to plot the positions of certain cellphone towers on the map. According to news reports, she told the court that she was confident the information provided to the court &#8220;was 99.9% correct&#8221;. Lawyer Peter Daubermann for Zolani Sibeko and Sinethemba Nenembe criticised Heyneke&#8217;s testimony based on her credentials and how she verified various cellphone data. Daubermann said Heyneke&#8217;s evidence was not based on his personal knowledge but relied on what someone else had said. Daubermann asked: &#8220;So you believe it is correct because Vodacom told you that it is correct?&#8221; Last week the court watched a secretly recorded video footage which revealed implicated Panayiotou s involvement in the killing of his wife. Panayiotou and his co-accused Zolani Sibeko and Sinethemba Nenembe have been charged with conspiring to kidnap and murder school teacher Jayde Panayiotou in April 2015. TNA Reporter &nbsp;
