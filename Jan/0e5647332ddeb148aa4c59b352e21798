The city of Ekurhuleni is preparing to lay out the red carpet for Cuban Vice-President Valdes Mesa and his delegation who will be attending a wreath-laying ceremony in honour of late ANC president Oliver Tambo in Wattville today.Mayor Mzwandile Masina said South Africa owed a debt of gratitude to Cuba and its late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro for their support for this country s liberation. We would like to pay tribute to his revolutionary dedication to the cause of the ordinary man, Masina said. An outstanding leader, whose name has become a household name among people who are struggling against imperialism. Certainly among people who, like the Cuban people, are conducting armed struggles for the liberation of their countries and their people. We have always been inspired by the mere mention of this name. He recalled that Tambo spoke at the sixth conference of heads of state in Cuba on behalf of the national liberation movements in 1979. Led by commander-in-chief Fidel Castro, Cuban soldiers selflessly sacrificed their lives in the darkest days of apartheid fighting against the draconian rule of the apartheid regime. So the city of Ekurhuleni is humbled by Cuba and its leadership to pay respects to a fellow revolutionary icon. Masina said the lives of both Tambo and Castro were intertwined in the revolution and struggle for the emancipation of their people to their very last breath .NTOMBI NKOSIntombin@thenewage.co.za
