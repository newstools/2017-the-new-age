A Rueful acting national police commissioner, Khomotso Phahlane, has told Parliament of the painful lessons police have learned during the arrest of a Soshanguve man accused of a coup plot. One lesson we must learn out of this unfortunate incident is to refrain from conducting investigations through the media, Phahlane said.This was because, he added, what allegedly was said to have been done and what appeared in the case docket were far from each other .He said police would in future refrain from giving any information about an investigation until a competent authority had made a decision on the nature of a prosecution.Phahlane and the acting head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, Lt-Gen Yolisa Matakata, yesterday gave members of the parliamentary portfolio committee on police an account of the alleged coup plot against President Jacob Zuma.This was after MPs expressed their dismay at how the matter had been handled. It is alleged that this is a coup. I m not sure where does that come from, Matakata said.Charges, she said, were normally presented by the National Prosecuting Authority, while the Hawks, usually investigated, sometimes under the guidance of a prosecutor. It was indicated initially the charges are conspiracy to commit murder and then they changed it. There is no such allegation of a coup plot, she said.Referring to the complaint made against the man, Elvis Ramosebudi, she said that a private company had made the first complaint to the police.Asked if the Hawks would review how the investigation had unfolded, she said, definitely so because this investigation took place from last October. It is a matter that I m taking up with those investigating this case. In reference to the suspect as well as any threat to senior ANC member Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, Phahlane said, we can t draw any relationship with threat analyses with respect to former AU chairperson and the man we are referring to. The man is going to be subjected a to a psychiatric evaluation, which will tell whether the screws are loose or tight. Yesterday, the chairperson of the portfolio committee, Francois Beukman, publicly urged the Minister of Police, Chief Justice and the Minister of Justice to fill the position of Investigating Judge into the Hawks, which became vacant with the death of Judge Essa Moosa recently.dennisc@thenewage.co.za
