North West Premier and ANC Chairperson Supra Mahumapelo has urged President Jacob Zuma to respect the decisions of the court. The premier’s statement followed a ruling in the North Gauteng High Court on Wednesday where Judge President Dunstan Mlambo ruled that Zuma’s review application of former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela’s recommendations in the State of Capture report was ill-advised and reckless. Mahumapelo said party members and South Africans must respect the role of the three inter-related arms of state. “We must respect the role of these inter-related arms of state. The president respects the Constitution and on numerous occasions, he has said so,” Mahumapelo said. He said all ANC members must respect Wednesday’s judgment. The North West premier said the judgment not demeaning but was rather a normal judgment that would normally be handed down. Mahumapelo said the courts must continue to play their role in all issues, irrespective of the position one holds. “Courts must unashamedly continue to execute their role but also there will be discomfort we have about some of the decision they make. The courts must accept that, they will be some of us in society who will raise whatever discomfort that we might have.’ The ANC is expected to hold its 54th national elective conference from 16 to 20 December at the Nasrec Expo Centre in Johannesburg. -Sipho Jack
