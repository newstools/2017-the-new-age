British oil giant BP rebounded back into net profit in the first quarter, energised by deep cost-cutting and rising crude prices, the group announced on Tuesday.Earnings after taxation stood at $1.45 billion (1.33 billion euros) in the first three months of the year, which contrasted with a net loss of $583 million during the first quarter of 2016, BP said in a statement.&#8220;Our year has started well. BP is focused on the disciplined delivery of our plans,&#8221; said chief executive Bob Dudley.&#8221;First-quarter earnings and cash flow were robust. We have shown continued operational momentum.&#8221;Replacement cost profit, an industry measure which strips out exceptional items and changes in the value of oil inventories, rose to $1.51 billion from $532 million.That easily beat market expectations of $1.21 billion, according to analysts polled by Bloomberg.-AFP
