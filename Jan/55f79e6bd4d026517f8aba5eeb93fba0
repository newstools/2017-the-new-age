A second mosque was attacked in the Western Cape on Monday in the space of three days.The imam at the mosque, Achmat Sity confirmed that in the latest incident, the Masjidul-Jamiah in Kalk Bay was splattered with blood and holy scriptures broken on Monday.Sity stated that their concern is that there was no evidence of forced entry on the mosque premises.The attack on the mosque happened in the evening while it was closed. The mosque operates during the day, in order for worshipers that want to pray to go during the day to go.Just two days earlier in nearby Simon&#8217;s Town, a bloody pig&#8217;s snout was left on the gate of Noorul Islam mosque.&#8220;This incident could be linked to the incident that occurred in Simon&#8217;s Town however we will be putting surveillance camera&#8217;s in the mosque to avoid such incidents occurring again&#8221;, said Sity.Sity said that they have a good relationship with the other religious leaders in the area so even with the ongoing Facebook attacks to burn mosque&#8217;s they believe that the leaders of the different religious groups will support them.One of the ways in which the mosque in Kalk Bay will put measures in place to avoid these incidents is to employ someone in the mosque permanently to sleep over to guard the place.-TNA Reporter
