World number three Jason Day insisted he can still recover his US Open campaign after a catastrophic opening round 79 on Thursday.The Australian star&#8217;s seven-over-par effort included two triple-bogeys &#8212; the first time he has ever recorded a pair of trebles in a single round.Day was at a loss to explain his performance, putting it down to a bad day at the office, and adamant that he had not thrown in the towel.&#8220;I just played bad golf, man,&#8221; Day said. &#8220;I can&#8217;t put it any other way other than that &#8212; just there was some good stuff mixed in with a lot of poor stuff. Two triples.&#8220;It&#8217;s weird. You sit there and it&#8217;s not like I gave up. I actually gave it 100% all the way through the end and I shot 79.&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of tough because out of every major championship I&#8217;ve played, this is probably &#8212; this has been the best preparation going into an event.&#8221;A solid start saw Day open with a birdie on the first, making the green in two and then two-putting.But a calamitous fourth hole saw him suffer the first of his two triple-bogeys, with the Aussie dropping three shots after twice failing to chip out of the rough behind the green.A birdie at seven renewed hope of a turnaround but the revival was short-lived. Back-to-back bogeys at eight and nine left him struggling at three over at the turn.More disasters struck on the 10th, when his second triple bogey left him at six over. A further bogey piled on Day&#8217;s misery in the 11th.Two more bogeys followed, with only the consolation of a birdie on 18 to soften the disappointment.Day however has not given up hope.&#8220;I think if the wind dies down a little bit tomorrow, I get out with some fresh greens, I might be able to get back in this championship with a solid round,&#8221; he said.&#8220;But, obviously didn&#8217;t get off to a great start.&#8221;-AFP
