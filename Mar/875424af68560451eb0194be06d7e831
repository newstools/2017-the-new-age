Child rapist and model agency boss Dawie de Villiers made a brief appearance at the South Gauteng High Court on Wednesday. De Villiers case was postponed to Tuesday the March 14, 2017 after his lawyer abandoned him and the judge was unavailable. Dawie asked for an extension of about three to four months to raise funds because his lawyer asked to withdraw from the case. De Villiers was found guilty of 32 out of 38 charges in February, including raping a child and sexual assault. When he was found guilty De Villiers told The New Age that he was not worried about the charges even as Judge Cassim Moosa read though the explosive evidence used to convict him. De Villiers had threatened to expose his alleged victims on social media if they dared to talk or deny him sexual favours. Other evidence heard was he had threatened a former pupil at his modelling agency that he would publish half naked photos of her and tell people she was a slut. A month ago Judge Moosa said De Villiers was a poor witness and considered the minor&#8217;s testimony to be credible, clear, and concise. She insisted throughout the trial that he had raped her, Moosa said. Although De Villiers had pleaded not guilty to 38 charges, 360 items of porn material including nude pictures of teenage girls were extracted from his computer and he was also accused of stealing between R150 000 and R200 000 from the founder of NGO Models Cup Dominique Rensleigh in 2008. De Villiers was found guilty of 32 of 38 charges and his sentencing has been postponed to Tuesday. He&#8217;s alleged victims were as young as 14 years old. TNA Reporter
