Attackers opened fire on a prison bus outside Colombo on Monday, killing five prisoners and two armed guards in the worst gang-related violence to hit Sri Lanka in decades.Gunmen sprayed bullets at the bus as it drove through a wooded area, police said, adding that four guards escaped with gunshot injuries.The prisoners were being driven to court for a hearing when the audacious daytime attack took place, police said.&#8220;It is believed that the shooting was a result of enmity between two underworld gangs,&#8221; police said in a statement.&#8220;Investigations are under way.&#8221;Security for underworld suspects had been tightened following a similar shooting on a prison bus that seriously wounded another suspected gang leader in the capital in March last year.Six people were killed in two separate incidents on that day, but police said Monday&#8217;s bus ambush was the deadliest gang-related attack in Sri Lanka in living memory.Automatic weapons are easily available eight years after the end of the country&#8217;s 37-year ethnic war.Attempts to crack down on possession of illegal firearms have been largely ineffective.-AFP
