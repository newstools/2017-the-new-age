To curb the poaching of rhinos in the province, the North West government will in June operate its own wild life college that will see upon completion a group of 40 young people deployed to various game parks across the province in pursuit of tight security.The provincial department of rural, environment and agricultural development interim spokesperson, Betty Moleko, said the role of the academy was to create adequate skills and capacity in as far as training of field rangers. The need for the establishment of the wildlife academy is informed by the vision of the fifth provincial administration to rebrand, reposition and renew the North-West province by generating the critical scarce skills that can enhance the biodiversity economy while creating jobs and reducing hunger and inequalities, Moleko said.In a statement released it is said that a group of 40 young people recruited last year were about to complete their training as game rangers and would on completion be deployed to various game parks across the province to tighten security. An estimated 32 students will be recruited in a year, Moleko said.The North West provincial government will before June this year operate its own wild life college, opening doors of learning to those interested in wild life management and game ranging.Moleko said the province like any other faced challenges in as far as rhino poaching was concerned. However department MEC Mankesi Tlhape said the province had experienced an increase in the number of rhinos poached, five were poached from government owned game parks while four were from privately owned parks . The need for us to work closely with communities along the parks in co-managing and strengthening security in our game parks cannot be over-emphasised. It remains our collective responsibility as the government and society to bring poaching in our parks to an end, Tlhape said.Meanwhile the province had also taken an initiative to educate the community about rhino poaching. North-West Parks Board, through its education for sustainable use programme driven by the social ecology unit, has partnered with Rhino Art, an NGO specialising in soliciting community support for the plight of the rhino, with the aim to increase conservation awareness among the youth, Moleko said.Tlhape also urged members of the community to report poaching incidents to the police for investigation, saying while some of the perpetrators of the December poaching incidents had been arrested, more still needed to be done to curb these criminal incidents. While the preparations have started, the academy has not incurred major expenses to date. However, expenditure will be further incurred in the new financial year commencing April 1, 2017, Moleko.Rhino poaching was made a national priority crime in 2014 and an integrated strategic management approach with key pillars including compulsory interventions managing the rhino population, sustainability and new interventions within the context of regional and international cooperation, was adopted.In 2016 between January and August 485 poached rhino carcasses were found in Kruger Park, compared to 557 in 2015, a 17.8% decrease.There was also a decrease of 5% in the number of black rhinos poached, so the continued collaboration through a joint management committee between South Africa and Mozambique seems to be working.CHARLOTE HLANGWANEprovinces@thenewage.co.za
