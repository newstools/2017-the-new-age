NGO Cupcakes of Hope has set its heart on breaking a Guinness World Record for the tallest tower of cupcakes.This sweet task, is all in the name of raising funds for families of children with cancer, as this month marks Childhood Cancer Awareness Month.The NGO said more than 5000 cupcakes will be used to build a nearly 11m tall tower that would see the NGO break the record.What will it take to make more than 5000 cupcakes you ask? Well, more than 625 eggs, 47kg of sugar, 26kg of butter, 50kg of flour and 52kg of icing sugar, the organisation said.Cupcakes of Hope founder Sandy Cipriano said they were not yet sure who the sponsor for the cupcakes will be at the moment. She has however called on the public and companies to get involved in being part of the fund raising event. Our aim is to raise R600000 on the day and the money will be used for stem cell and bone marrow transplants for young children with cancer, Cipriano said. There are a few children in our network who are waiting for stem cell transplants and we have a boy now who has found a match, hence the big drive behind it, but it s going to generally be four kids on our network, she said.The boy, Dominic, three, was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia last year. Cipriano said children who have been diagnosed with life-threatening diseases can join the network, provided they bring a doctor s letter confirming diagnosis to register with the NGO. Once they are registered as one of our beneficiaries we actually help them with day to day expenses, like transport to hospital be it at Steve Biko or depending on where they are. We also pay for specialised food if they need to be on certain formulas, food or supplements, she said. She said the money raised in the Guinness World Record attempt will be used for transplants. The record will be attempted in later this month. LERATO DIALE leratod@thenewage.co.za
