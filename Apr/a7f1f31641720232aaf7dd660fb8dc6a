The rise in illegal school transport operators that endanger the lives of pupils has been described as an accident waiting to happen .Eighteen school children were burnt beyond recognition when the minibus taxi they were travelling in collided with a heavy-duty truck and burst into flames just after Bronkhorstspruit last Friday. The victims were aged five to 10 years.The National Taxi Association (NTA) yesterday warned there were thousands of self-appointed operators countrywide ferrying kids to school without the requisite documentation.In the last four months, 34 school children were killed in accidents while 38 were injured.NTA spokesperson Theo Malele said the tragic end to the young lives in unregulated vehicles points directly to the ineptitude of the government to police illegal operators. If we had decisive leaders they would have taken into cognizance the fact that our children, especially black children, are driven in vehicles that are not being properly regulated. They are not subsidised and we need to guard against such. We can never allow our children to be transported by just anybody, Malele said.Johannesburg metro police department spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said quite often they have drivers paying fines for not complying with the law. We do come across drivers with no professional driving permit, no roadworthy certificates and they are made to pay fines, Minaar said.Vehicles used for scholar transport must be tested at a roadworthy centre every six months and must have a special vehicle fitness certificate.Alina Lehlokoana, a School-Link franchise operator, said townships countrywide were flooded with unregistered scholar transport operators. It s sad because the (scholar transport) policy is not being implemented. The transporters are bound to do things their own way because no one monitors them, Lehlokoana said.In December, 10 children died in a head-on collision between a taxi and a bakkie on the R726 road between Zastron and Sterkspruit.Two weeks later, four children were killed while 16 were injured in Durban.Malele said some of the accidents could have been averted had the government heeded their calls to implement policies like the scholar transport policy.The Transport Department s national pupil transport policy says the approach to pupil transport safety must involve a range of safety measures, including vehicle characteristics, the promotion of other safety measures, driver qualifications, measures to protect pupils against sexual offenders, training and education and publicity and awareness actions aimed at all stakeholders .The Gauteng education department s policy statement pledges to ensure and protect the rights of pupils to access education as entrenched in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa through a reliable and safe scholar transport system .However, Lehlokoana said there were more illegal operators transporting kids than legitimate ones.A total of 114000 pupils in the Eastern Cape need scholar transport but only 67801 children are benefiting from the government programme. The remaining 46 199 pupils have to depend on other modes, which may be unsafe, Lehlokoana said.In the Umzinyathi education district in KwaZulu-Natal, only 15 out of the more than 500 schools are provided with scholar transport due to a lack of funding.The department s 2016-17 budget for scholar transport is R462m. The majority of parents would rather pay the guy who charges R300 and leave us, who charge R900 a month but follow the stipulated standards. We come across the illegal operators overloaded and in a hurry to deliver kids, putting their lives at risk, Lehlokoana said.Lehlokoana paid R110 000 for the School-Link franchise and said there was no way chancers would get involved.MTHOKOZISI DUBEmtokozisid@thenewage.co.za
