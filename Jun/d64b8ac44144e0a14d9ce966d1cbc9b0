President Jacob Zuma believes the opposition would lose its electoral gains they made in the previous local government elections if the country were to go to the polls tomorrow.Zuma said this during today&#8217;s question-and-answer session in the National Assembly today.&#8220;If we went to elections now, you&#8217;ll lose them. Because the people have realised the mistakes they made,you will not win them again,&#8221; Zuma said.Zuma took jabs at the DA suggesting that the party had to beg other parties in order to garner enough votes to lead the metros they now govern.&#8220;I can tell you, next elections you will never win these metros,&#8221; he said.The DA made gains during the 2016 local government elections, taking control of major metros including the city of Tshwane, Nelson Mandela Bay and the city of Johannesburg previously in the hands of the ANC.The DA secured the metros primarily by getting into coalition governments with the opposition parties including the EFF and UDM.Zuma reminded the DA that their current position was contingent on other parties.&#8220;You may find yourself out of power before 2019 in those metros because the EFF is currently threatening you. You are scared the EFF will run away, Zuma told the DA leader, Mmusi Maimane.Recently EFF leader Julius Malema said that the EFF would no longer vote alongside the DA if it failed to deal decisively with the Western Cape Premier Helen Zille over a series of pro-colonialism tweets.Zuma added that he was fit for the job of being president after Maimane asked him if he believed he was the right person to lead South Africa.&#8220;The people of this country did not make a mistake in electing me as president. I am fit and doing the job,&#8221; he said.&#8211;TNA reporter
