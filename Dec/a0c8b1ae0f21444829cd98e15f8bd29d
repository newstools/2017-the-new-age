A major crime prevention operation in the form of a roadblock was conducted along the N1 Highway, on both the south and north-bound lanes between Mokopane and Polokwane on Tuesday. The operation formed part of an ongoing Festive Season Joint Operation, which will run for the duration of the holiday period, throughout the province, focusing on the prevention of all categories of crimes. The operation, led by provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nneke Ledwaba, commenced with a parade at the Provincial Joint Operation Centre. A number of heads of departments were in attendance. Provincial Head of Corporate Communication Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the objective of the operation was to strengthen road policing strategies for a safer festive season period and to sensitise all motorists about the prevalence of crime trends by distributing the crime prevention hints. “During this roadblock, all cars and people were searched thoroughly from both sides of the road and those found to be in contravention of any law, such as the Road Traffic Act, were issued with spot fines. The focus was also on other illegal items such as unlicensed firearms, stolen vehicles, dangerous weapons and wanted suspects,” Mojapelo said. Three thousand pamphlets on crime prevention hints were also distributed. -TNA Reporter
