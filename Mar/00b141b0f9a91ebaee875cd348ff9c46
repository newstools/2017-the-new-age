The Road Trafffic Management Corporation (RTMC) is expected to appear in court on Friday in order to force Tasima to hand over control of eNatis as ordered by the Constitutional Court.RTMC has indicated that it s fully equiped to operate the eNatis system and there s no reason for Tasima to refuse to hand it over.In February, the Constitutional Court delivered a final blow to Tasima s attempts to hold on to the eNatis vehicle management system despite the court s ruling that it should be handed over to RTMC.In Novermber 2015 the court delivered a judgment ordering Tasima to hand over the system to the RTMC within 30 days. The court delivered a judgment in November last year ordering Tasima to hand over the system to the RTMC within 30 days, RTMC said in a statement.However Tasima held on to the system and launched an urgent application seeking direct access to the court to interpret its November judgment. But RTMC opposed the applications.During the ruling the court dismissed Tasima s urgent application with costs as it bears no prospect of success .RTMC CEO Advocate Makhosini Msibi said: This is a vindication of the RTMC s position that Tasima has to hand over the system within 30 days and vacate the premises it currently occupies. The RTMC is ready to take over and start operating the system on with immediate effect The dispute over the system has dragged on for several years and many court battles have fought to have it handed to government as originally envisaged. The order is seen as bringing closure to the matter.-TNA Reporter
