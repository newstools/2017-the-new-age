The South African Football Association (SAFA) has on Tuesday announced that they have accepted FIFA&#8217;s ruling to replay their match against Senegal. This comes after FIFA gave a directive that the 2018 World Cup qualifier match between Bafana Bafana and Senegal will be replayed. The soccer association in Senegal made a complaint to FIFA for referee Joseph Lamptey s decision during the match. Following the confirmation of the Court of Arbitration for Sport, the referee received a lifetime ban for match manipulation, the ruling imposed by the FIFA Disciplinary and Appeal Committees. We have decided that we will comply with the FIFA directive to replay the match against Senegal at a date to be decided. However, we have noted that the official at the center of all this controversy has appealed his case to the courts of law and if the courts overturn the decision, everything becomes null, void and SAFA will reserve its right to challenge the decision of FIFA to replay the match, said Safa. The football association added that delegates at the meeting that was held on Monday were divided on whether to explore the legal route or the ethical and moral route. &#8220;The association resolved on moral and ethical grounds that we cannot be beneficiaries of corrupt activities.&#8221; The date of the replay of the match between the two countries has not yet been decided.
