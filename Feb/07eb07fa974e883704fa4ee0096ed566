Police said the suspects held garage staff at gunpoint in Elsies River and robbed them before they fled in two vehicles.The incident was reported and SAPS gave the robbery its immediate attention which led to the arrests of the suspects just hours later. The suspects aged between 24 and 44, will be making their first appearance in court later this week. Provincial police spokesperson Lt-Col Andr Traut said: Last night members of the stabilisation unit reacted on information of an armed robbery that had been perpetrated at a garage in Elsies River and that a number of armed suspects had fled the scene in two vehicles. About 10.20pm, after searching the surrounding area, three suspects in a Toyota Avanza were apprehended in Vanguard Drive, Langa and found in possession of a Daisy air rifle, a 9mm short Norinco pistol and eight rounds of ammunition, he said. Further investigation by SAPS members led them to arrest other four suspects involved in the armed robbery. Investigation led the members to Browns Farm in Philippi East where the second vehicle, an Audi, was recovered and another four suspects were arrested and a firearm, a 9mm short Norinco pistol and three rounds of ammunition were seized, Traut said.
