BAFANA Bafana interim coach Owen Da Gama has a logical explanation to choosing Guinea Bissau as friendly opponents ahead of the 2018 World Cup qualifier against Cape Verde in September.South Africa began their training camp on Monday ahead of the international friendly against the West African side at Moses Mabhida stadium on Saturday. Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde are two former colonies, a lot of their players play in Portugal so there s a similar approach with regards to how they play, Da Gama said.After tackling the African Wild Dogs, Bafana Bafana will proceed to East London to face Angola at Buffalo City Stadium on Tuesday night. The Bafana coach sounded upbeat about the squad assembled. We have brought a very exciting team, I think the technical team has done well in terms of the selection. The thinking was about continuity from the squad that played in the Senegal match and did very well. We have also added some young and exciting players who have been doing very well for their teams. It is important we acknowledge players when they do well at their clubs, after all, we always want that to present you with the best possible Bafana Bafana team. There are also other players who have been on top of their game and are not here, but they are also under the radar. I have constantly been asked about specific players who are not selected, but I think it is important that we pay tribute to the players that are here, acknowledge their selection and focus on that. We certainly hope the boys give a fantastic display. news@thenewage.co.za-Linda Ximba
