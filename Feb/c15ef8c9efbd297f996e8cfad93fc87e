US Defense Secretary James Mattis said Saturday that Iran was the world&#8217;s biggest state sponsor of terrorism, as President Donald Trump slapped fresh sanctions on the country&#8217;s weapons procurement network.&#8220;As far as Iran goes, this is the single biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the world,&#8221; Mattis said at a press conference in Tokyo, but added that the US had no plans to increase troop numbers in the Middle East in response.&#8220;It does no good to ignore it. It does no good to dismiss it and at the same time I don&#8217;t see any need to increase the number of forces we have in the Middle East at this time,&#8221; he said.&#8221;We always have the capability to do so but right now I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessary.&#8221;US officials said that the new sanctions, announced on Friday, were in response to Iran&#8217;s ballistic missile test this week and its support for Huthi rebels in Yemen, who recently targeted a Saudi warship.The new sanctions do not yet mean that the US has abandoned commitments it made under an earlier deal to lift measures aimed at Iran&#8217;s nuclear programme, officials said.But Trump has made no secret of his contempt for that accord, which his predecessor Barack Obama approved in July 2015, and officials said Friday&#8217;s measures would not be the last against the country.-AFP
