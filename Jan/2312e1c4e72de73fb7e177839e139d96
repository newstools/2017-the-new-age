Having missed him in the previous Super Rugby season, the Bulls have welcomed back mercurial flyhalf Handr Pollard by appointing him as captain.The Pretoria outfit have made the necessary change as regular captain Adriaan Strauss is still recovering from surgery.The move thrusts the talented Springbok pivot back into the thick of things, making it clear that he will be the preferred No 10 ahead of Tian Schoeman and Francois Brummer.This is an appointment that will prove to Pollard that his contribution is highly valued as Bulls coach Nollis Marais overlooked other quality and experienced players when making the decision. Handr is an amazing rugby player and a natural-born leader and we are privileged to have a young man of his calibre in our system, he said. He has a strong personality and great vision for the game, as he has shown time and again at all levels. Couple that with the respect he has earned from the players and the vital experience he has gained with the Springboks, and his appointment becomes obvious.
