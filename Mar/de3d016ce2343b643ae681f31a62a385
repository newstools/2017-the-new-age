The Dolphins have received a timely boost with the return of Proteas bowler Imran Tahir and all-rounder Andile Phehlukwayo ahead of their Momentum OneDay Cup match against the Cape Cobras at Boland Park in Paarl at 2pm today.The duo s return will be a welcome relief, particularly as the Dolphins are eager to get back to winning ways following their defeat by 130 runs to the Warriors at the weekend. Phehlukwayo and Tahir helped the Proteas record a 3-2 ODI series victory over New Zealand on Saturday and will look to carry their impressive performances over to domestic competition.Dolphins coach Grant Morgan is pleased to have the duo back and said they will play an important role in the competition. It is great to have the likes of Andile and Imran back, Morgan said. They have been absolute world beaters for the Proteas and it will be good to have them back in the mix going forward in the Momentum One Day Cup. With the likes of those two and Cameron Delport back in the mix, it s definitely one of the strongest squads we could assemble. The Cobras will also be looking to get their campaign on track after losing to the Highveld Lions by three wickets on Friday. They remain bottom of the log with seven points from five matches following two wins and three defeats.The Cape side will be desperate for a victory to move up the table and captain Dane Piedt is looking for a better showing. What we need in the last five games is to perform the basics well and execute our skills. We require even more clinical performances, Piedt said. We have a very experienced unit who know what is needed to power the Cobras to a win against the Dolphins. We will definitely be fielding three seam bowlers. We must take care of lapses that undermine our effectiveness with bat or ball. -Neville Khoza|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
