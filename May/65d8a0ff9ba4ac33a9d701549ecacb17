For the brave and ambitious, making a loss in your business is not a bad thing. That s if you want to avoid paying tax. This was explained at the Ort Tax Workshop last week. Emarentia Ngema from the South African Revenue Service (SARS) whipped through the tax implications as they applied to sole proprietors and small business owners.SARS intends to encourage small business having recognised that it is vital player in the informal economy and when added together, contributes to job creation with two to three people per business. SARS will hold your losses, you have no tax obligation, until your company makes a profit and then your profit is deducted from your earlier losses.You end up paying tax on a much smaller amount. For the individual providing a personal service, your first R75000 of income is tax free, below the age of R65 and from age 65 to 75 the threshold is R116 150. An SBC is a new tax incentive, not a business structure, derived from a combination of dividend, rental, interest income and royalties (investment) or a saleable skill such as accounting, translation or engineering among others (personal).An SBC is taxed at the lowest rate, for example on income of R310000 a sole proprietor will pay R46060 while an SBC pay just R16 450 on the same income.-TNA REPORTER|business@thenewage.co.za
