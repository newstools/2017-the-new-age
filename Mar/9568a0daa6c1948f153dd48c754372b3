Actress and language activist, Florence Masebe and Afro-soul crooner, Nathi Mankayi, are two South African artists who were recognised on Tuesday for putting their vernacular languages on the map in their respective professions.Masebe, a former Muvhango actress, was awarded the PanSALB language activism award at the language body s Public Lecture and Language Awards held at the Cape Town International Convention Centre.Mankayi won a music category award for the effective use of multilingualism in an album through his second album, Umbulelo Wam, released late last year.SuperSport commentator Baba Mthethwa was another winner. He took honours in the media award category, while SABC1 soapie, Skeem Saam, won an award in the TV-Radio programme category.PanSALB chief executive officer, Rakwena Reginald Mpho Monareng and judge Albie Sachs, delivered the keynote addresses and led the discussion about the importance of linguistic human rights and the promotion and use of all official languages. The Constitution provides a framework for invigoration, greater energy and projection of African languages, not used in daily discourse, but also in public discourses, literature, science, law and elsewhere, Sachs said. But we do not have to amend the Constitution to get there. The mechanisms are there, we have to develop the policies to achieve the kind of progress and advances we envisioned. Established in 2002, the awards have grown in standard, stature and impact into an annual gala attended by over 600 high profile government officials, non-governmental officials, academics, partners and sponsors.Taking to Twitter, Masebe acknowledged the honour and said while she was humbled, she feels South Africans should not have to win awards in order to speak their languages. Thank you @PanSALB for the honour. It s sad to receive an award for speaking an African language on the continent, we need to support PanSALB, she tweeted.The board also honoured award-winning and critically acclaimed author E skia Mphahlele with a chairperson s lifetime achievement award.SIYABONGA SITHOLE
