There&#8217;s no end of competitions run by motor manufacturers to win all sorts of things these days, but the vast majority require very little by way of effort, regardless of how big or small the prizes are. That&#8217;s not the case with one Land Rover has just launched in the United States though.The British luxury 4&#215;4 manufacturer is now running a competition where US consumers have the chance to win one of four places on the Land Rover Experience Tour Peru 2017.It certainly isn&#8217;t a case of winning a raffle to get one of the places on offer, as the events run across four separate locations are genuine off-road trials.The first of the four trials was held at the Overland Expo West in Flagstaff, Arizona at the weekend. A further three winners will be selected from further trials to be conducted at each of the three Land Rover Experience Driving Schools located in California, Vermont and North Carolina.Each of the four trials are free to enter, and full details can be found by visiting the Land Rover Experience website or by calling any of the three Land Rover Experience (LRE) Driving Centers of Quail Lodge in Carmel, California; the Equinox Resort in Manchester, Vermont; or the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina. Anyone who wasn&#8217;t successful at the Overland Expo West event is allowed to enter once more at any one of the three LRE locations.When the four winners have been selected, they&#8217;ll then travel in two pairs to join separate waves of the Land Rover Experience Tour Peru 2017. One pair will take part between October 28 and November 3 to negotiate more than 500 miles of challenging terrain from Cusco, through Machu Piccu, Pitchari, Satipo, and concluding in Huancayo. The second pair will join the event between November 4 and November 9, leaving Huancayo for a 400 mile journey over the Peruvian mountains and across the desert to Pisco in Peru.Contestants on the trials are required to drive a Land Rover-designed off-road course where they&#8217;ll be judged on the precision of their obstacle tackling and their speed for safely completing the course.Consumers will be able to sign up for a spot on one of the trials from June 1 by visiting the LRE website or by contacting one of the US or Canadian LRE Driving Schools.-Relaxnews
