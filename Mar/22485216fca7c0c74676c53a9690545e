The SANDF has assessed the site in Witfield, Boksburg where Richard Thole, five, has been trapped since Saturday and will be coming up with an action plan to continue the search for him.Col William Bucibe of the defence force said yesterday that they had assessed the site and met with a team of experts to determine the best course of action to find the little boy who fell down a mine shaft. We will go back to brief our superiors and see what action to take from here, Bucibe said.The SANDF was brought in after Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina wrote a letter to the Minister of Defence on Wednesday asking for assistance with rescue operations after the search was halted by a massive rockfall at 60m impacting operations on site.Richard fell down the deep hole of the disused mine while playing with a friend near the shaft in the Jerusalem informal settlement.Although his anguished parents are hoping for a miracle they said hope was fading as each day passed without their little boy being found. All we want is the child to be recovered, whether dead or alive we want him, his mother Nombeko said.Briefing the MMC for community and safety, Vivian Chauke, after it was decided to call off the search temporarily on Wednesday, the mine rescue team, said that nothing further could be done as the camera that had been sent into the shaft in a bid to help locate the little boy had also broken. We have done everything we can, there is no ventilation flow in the shaft and there are no other tunnels connected to the shaft, a rescuer said.EMS spokesperson William Ntladi said the operations were temporarily suspended until further notice and chances of the child still alive were minimal due to acidic water that was found inside. The shaft contains acidic water and toxic gas and the oxygen levels are very low, so they will engage and find alternative routes, Ntladi said.Earlier, illegal miners who operate around the Boksburg area had offered to help retrieve Richard. Endurance Kazembe told The New Age that he was willing to get inside the shaft and come back with the child if the rescuers provided him with the right gear and oxygen. I have been doing this job since 2001 so I know these mine shafts. These people don t want to take advice, Kazembe said.Ntladi said that as officials they could not allow just anybody to go inside the shaft without considering the safety aspects.news@thenewage.co.za
