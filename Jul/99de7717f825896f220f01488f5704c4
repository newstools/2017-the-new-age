The ANC s strategy and tactics commission is proposing a major overhaul of its operations to address rampant factionalism and serious operational deficiencies following heated debate at its fifth national policy conference in Johannesburg yesterday.According to national executive committee (NEC) member Joel Netshitenzhe, the road map that will be proposed to branches ahead of its national elective conference in December is part of a concerted effort to stem the tide of corruption, faction fighting and gate-keeping, among others.The party is also proposing structural changes to its organisational design.In another significant development, Netshitenzhe said nine out of 11 commissions rejected the concept of white monopoly capital.The ANC s Febe Potgieter-Gqubule also said that as part of its organisational renewal, branches would now discuss the options of an ANC NEC overhaul and possible changes to the party s processes for electing leaders. We need to reduce the size of the ANC NEC to make it workable so that we are able to discuss issues and process issues but to also ensure that we have the best in the ANC. Size will range from anything between 40 and 60 people, she saidPotgieter-Gqubule said branches would consider enlarging the ANC NEC s top six structure to include two deputy presidents and two deputy secretaries-general. The proposal is that we should have two deputy presidents with specific responsibilities. The second option is to only have two deputy secretaries-general, she said.Netshitenzhe said discussions on the party s strategy and tactics policy document acknowledged the existence of zwhite monopoly capital. The 1962 programme of the SACP used the notion of white monopoly capital. And at the same time the ANC might have used the notion of white monopoly capital, he said.Meanwhile, attempts by the ANC s leadership to keep a lid on the rampant factionalism that has torn the ruling party apart was put to the test during acrimonious debates in key commissions on the fifth day of the national policy conference and is yet another indication that the party remains a house divided.According to various sources, a clash between presidential contender Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma and SACP deputy secretary-general Jeremy Cronin in the organisational renewal commission was the clearest indication yet that patience among branch delegates with President Jacob Zuma s detractors is running out.According to the sources Cronin and Dlamini Zuma almost came to blows after Dlamini Zuma pushed for the mining charter to be implemented speedily.Opposition from Cronin triggered the confrontation, the sources said. NDZ was not be shut down and called Cronin a liar who enjoyed the suffering of black people. Things got so heated that both NDZ and Cronin were asked to leave the commission and resolve their issues outside. The sources said Dlamini Zuma confronted Cronin s supporters in the commission and shouted RET (radical economic transformation) will come even if some within the ANC don t want it .Similar scenes played out in the economic development commission where another Zuma detractor, Derek Hanekom, was at the centre of a storm when he opposed a proposal on the expropriation of land without compensation.Sources said that this did not sit well with delegates. Hanekom was booed and told to leave the ANC if he didn t believe in land expropriation without compensation. Delegates reminded Hanekom that this was not the Kathrada memorial, the sources said.The policy conference ends today.-Bonolo Selebano and Sifiso Mahlangu
