THE South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) still intends to go after Gauteng motorists who refuse to pay e-tolls. The non-compliance rate in February this year was 71%.Minister of Transport Joe Maswanganyi said Sanral calculated the compliance rate in rand value due to invoices varying in terms of tariff due to class of vehicle, time of day and frequent user discount. Additionally, it should also be noted that once a vehicle reaches the monthly cap, invoices are still issued even though the value is zero. The compliance rate for February based on rand value was 29%, he replied in writing to a Parliamentary question by DA member of Parliament David Ross.Maswanganyi added that he was unable to disclose the value of the outstanding debt. Due to year-end processes and audits to be concluded, the value of outstanding debt can t be disclosed. This will be available once the auditor-general has concluded the audit on July 31, he said. The audited results, as at March 31, 2016, reflects the outstanding value (trade receivables), which would be for unregistered users, as R7.2m. Maswanganyi said millions of invoices were issued between April 2015 and March 2017.A fraction were paid. In April 2015, only 19 863 758 of 71 645 232 invoices issued were paid. In April 2016, 77 365 952 invoices were distributed, but only 23 353 454 were honoured. In March this year, 23 311 700 out of 83 204 579 invoices that were circulated, were paid.Ross also asked him directly if Sanral intended to take registered and/or nonregistered e-toll users to court for not paying invoices. Maswanganyi replied: Yes, the recovery is based on a user pay principle irrespective of whether the user is registered or not registered.Such a recovery process will be embarked upon once all the prescribed legal processes have been followed. He said, in terms of legislation, the owner of a vehicle that passed under a gantry and a toll plaza, where the liability to pay the toll is recorded by an electrical or electronic device, was liable to pay the toll to Sanral. Both registered and non-registered, individuals and companies registered in terms of our company laws of the Republic, will be taken to court based on the merits of the case, he said.DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
