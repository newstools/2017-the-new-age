SOME of Bidvest Wits fringe players who took part in the club s defeat to Jomo Cosmos in the Nedbank Cup could face a long time on the sidelines. That is if they still have a future with The Students. Wits bowed out of the tournament following a 5-4 penalty defeat to the National First Division side at Tsakane stadium on Tuesday.The teams played to a 1-1 draw with the PSL side coming from behind to get an equaliser to take the match to extra time and spot kicks. After the humiliating exit from the competition, an angry Wits coach Gavin Hunt said he regretted not substituting some of his players as early as five minutes into the game. I m disappointed. It was always going to be a battle so congratulations to Cosmos. Nobody will remember how they got through but they will, we have to give them credit. But we have to look at our own players, I gave some players a chance on the night and they didn t use it well. They complain about not being chosen but you saw what happened and why they don t always play. That is the biggest disappointment because we need our squad, we need every player and I gave a few the game against Jomo Cosmos. I should have taken them out after five minutes but I didn t and there was no change. The visibly disappointed Hunt went as far as saying certain players are highly unlikely to play again for the Clever Boys anytime soon. They won t get another chance, no, now I know where I am, I have known from the start of the season, he said. Some of the Wits players who have seen limited game time this season and were given a run against Cosmos are Bongani Khumalo, Siboniso Gaxa, Ejike Uzoenyi and Jabulani Shongwe.
