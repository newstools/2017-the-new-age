Hashim Amla s form at the Indian Premier League (IPL) bodes well for the Proteas ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy next month in England. Amla seems to have found his mojo at the right time with the ICC Champions Trophy around the corner.This after he became the third batsman in IPL history to score two centuries in a season following an unbeaten 104 off just 60 balls against Gujarat Lions on Sunday. He also scored a century last month against Mumbai Indians but ended up on the losing side in both matches. Before the IPL season started, Amla had struggled for form together with other Proteas top six batsmen in the Test series against New Zealand.That was a concern for Proteas coach Russell Domingo ahead of the Champions Trophy, but he would be pleased to see him scoring runs at the IPL as he finished with 420 runs at a strike rate of 145. The game on Sunday was his last in the IPL as together with the other Proteas players he returned home to begin preparations for the ICC tournament. I am happy to get some runs. What else can I say, I m very grateful, Amla said. In T20 cricket everyone who plays has to find ways to maximise scoring off each ball that they face. There are many examples of cricketers who have been successful despite not being agricultural as they say and it happens every time that someone score runs, who is not a massive hitter of the ball. Amla will now hope to take that form to the Champions Trophy with the Proteas to start with a match against Sri Lanka on June 3 at The Oval in London.-NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
