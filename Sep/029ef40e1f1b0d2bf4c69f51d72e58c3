IN ITS ongoing efforts to keep the desire for innovations in science and technology burning in the minds and hearts of pupils in primary and secondary schools, the Eskom s Expo for Young Scientists held the provincial show at Ngoako Ramathlodi Sports Complex in Seshego outside Polokwane.Kamogelo Rakgetse, a Grade 11 pupil at Abram Serote Secondary School in Tafelkop outside Groblersdal impressed judges with his innovative model for a power station.Rakgetse s design is based on the principle of magnetic induction between materials with a different permeability. This technology allows the drive shaft to levitate in a stable and safe way without the need for external power and with a cost that is lower than fossil fuel based power stations, he said.The young pupil said his idea was sparked by the over-reliance on fossil fuel such as coal and oil to produce power, which would not only eventually run out but is damaging to the environment and expensive to produce.He impressed judges and was awarded Eskom s best development project prize and a gold medal for his innovation. The rural school pupil said his dream was to study electronics after passing matric.Other pupils who shone included Bosoga Maisela of Sebitja High in Zebediela who scooped Eskom s best energy project for the model new machine water detector.Musawenkosi Mupezeni a Grade 10 pupil at Flora Park Comprehensive High in Polokwane won Eskom s best energy efficiency project for his green power station and Carli Malan a Grade 11 pupil at Pietersburg High won Eskom s best female project for her project, electricity out of water.The organisers said 321 pupils displayed their projects and competed for prizes at the expo. Finalists will enter the Young Scientists International Science Fair, which will run from October 3 to 6 in Johannesburg.The Limpopo regional Eskom Science Expo director, Serefo Mpaneng, said: It s inspiring to see young people thinking about solutions in the early stages of their lives. I have been with the Eskom Expo for 20 years and have seen some solid careers being built in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
