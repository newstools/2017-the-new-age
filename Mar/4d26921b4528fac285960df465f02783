At least 2000 people gathered at the South gate taxi rank on Thursday to march against rape.The march hosted by MEC Sizakele Nkosi Malobane comes after a string of cases involving the rape of several women in taxis around Johannesburg.Nkosi-Malobane said &#8220;real men don&#8217;t rape, we need to stand up and protect women. Enough is enough let&#8217;s make sure that those criminals are arrested&#8221;Nkosi-Malobane also called on the taxi industry to hand over rapists to authorities.A victim told Kaya FM in a radio interview which emerged last week, that she was allegedly raped by three men.During the interview she said: I boarded a taxi (white Quantum), inside there were three men and a lady. At the next stop the other lady got off, she said, once alone the men targeted her.The men raped her, demanded her bank cards and pin codes. The men were carrying a speed point with them, she alleged.She was then dumped at a veld in Dube, Soweto where she got help from a man who told her she was the third victim he had helped.Meanwhile, more taxi rape victims have come forward bringing the number to nine.Gauteng community safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane said the number of cases were rising after she met eight of the rape victims. The ninth one approached us on Friday, however she won t be part of the group that will be debriefed, as she has not yet received proper counselling. But the number has been growing daily, she said.An increased number of women came forward after reports that a female commuter was raped for four hours in front of her 10-year-old son after boarding a taxi on Ontdekkers Road in the West Rand last week.-TNA Reporter
