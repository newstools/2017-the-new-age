It is hard to believe that Zimbabwebornsongbird Berita was introduced to the South African music scene just a few years ago, but looking at her portfolio, the award-winning singer seems like someone who has already cemented her spot with her 2012 hit song, Thandolwethu.After winning the Wawela Music Award for best songwriter, the sultry singer, who is prolific on the guitar too, is back, serving her army of fans with another beautiful and relatable song called Surprises.The songstress describes her new single as a feel-good song that will get people dancing while getting a dose of inspiration from the lyrics. Surprises is a song that aims to brighten your day when all seems gloomy, she said. This song celebrates life, I m saying lighten up because life is full of beautiful surprises. Surprises is the second single off her album and she said it was inspired by her feeling that we should find joy in the present and hope in the future. The song is about the simple ways of enjoying and appreciating life, as it is unpredictable and full of surprises, so people should not wallow in their sorrow because we do not know what tomorrow will bring, the singer, born Gugulethu Khumalo, said.The 25 year old, who honed her singing skills in East London in the Eastern Cape, said for her upcoming album set to drop in April, she worked with music maestros who understood the direction her sound was taking. I have worked with some of the brilliant people in the industry. Jazz most and Nigerian guitarist Kunle Ayo produced my album alongside the legendary Mojalefa Mjakes Thebe, so I was in good hands, Berita said.The songstress made her way to South African shores in 2012 to pursue her tertiary education at the Walter Sisulu University, where she enrolled for a financial information systems degree.In 2014, she moved to Johannesburg to further her music career and at that, she released Songs Of Empowerment and the Metro FM Award-winning album, Conquering Spirit.Her hit single, Thandolwethu, became an anthem for many who believe in love.The song was on high rotation on radio stations, an admirable achievement for a young girl who had just moved to the busy city with nothing but her guitar.Berita s new song is now available on iTunes and her album is due in April and a handful of pleasant surprises is what the songbird has promised.NONTOKOZO GXUMISA
