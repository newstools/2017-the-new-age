After recounting the horror in police detention more than 45 years ago, Dr Saleem Essop, who was arrested along with struggle icon Ahmed Timol, relived his ordeal yesterday when he visited the Johannesburg Central police station.Formerly known as John Vorster Square, the visit to the station invoked painful memories not only for Essop but others who had also suffered the same fate at the hands of apartheid-era police. Among those who endured torture by the police was Phillip Dhlamini who said it was surreal visiting the station for the first time without shackles .Recounting his experience in detention, Essop said he had tufts of his hair pulled out, his legs stiffened and a number of scratches and bruises on his body.He said after days of torture by apartheid security police he was in a state of near total collapse and could not have tried committing suicide. I would have had no physical capacity to commit suicide even if I had wanted to. I was getting more incapacitated, he said.In any case, he added, he was never left alone in the room for him to get the opportunity to even try killing himself. There were always police officers, sometimes three at a time, trying to get information out of him, he said.He recalled how he was dangled from the stairway 10 floors high and told how he could die from that point.Essop was making submissions in the inquest into the death of Timol who died in police detention in 1971. Timol died five days after his arrest. An inquest was held in 1972 and the magistrate ruled that it was suicide and no one should be held responsible.However, Essop said Timol was someone who loved and enjoyed life and would have never wanted to die.Timol s family pursued the case and were successful in having a second inquest opened The hearings are happening in the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg, presided over by judge Billy Mothle.The court yesterday visited the police station for an inspection where Essop and another witness gave their first hand accounts of what they experienced in detention.Dhlamini, who was detained at the Johannesburg Central police station a number of times between 1977 and 1980, could not be in the room where Timol supposedly jumped out of a window.Visibly shaken by the visit, he said the inquest was a healing process forhim. All the torture we went through brought out a lot of anger and what is happening now takes away a lot of issues. The Timol inquest is not only helping the family but also many other families and victims of detention without trial, he said.LILLIAN SELAPISAlillians@thenewage.co.za
