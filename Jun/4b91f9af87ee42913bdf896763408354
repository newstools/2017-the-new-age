PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma has praised the launch of two programmes aligned with his radical economic transformation agenda, saying they will change the lives of black farmers who for years have struggled to find a market for their produce.The programmes seek to overhaul the economy by giving small black farmers a chance to supply entities like schools and hospitals. Launching Operation Vula and Radical Agrarian Socio-Economic Transformation in Ixopo, Zuma said this was history in the making as previously there were no programmes aimed solely at giving black farmers access to markets.Already piloted in Empangeni, the programmes entail small farmers having their products taken to central depots to be pooled and sold to schools and hospitals. Later, it will be sold to prisons and big supermarkets like Spar, Cambridge Foods and Game, he said.The central depot, to be managed by district development agencies, will then pay dividends according to input per farmer. Zuma said the programmes could be implemented in other provinces. These are the first programmes of their kind that give farmers a chance to reach markets. I commend them as they will change lives, Zuma said.He expressed gratitude to the big businesses that had embraced the programmes. These big businesses will still derive good dividends as before. Money is money, regardless of where you got it. Sihle Zikalala, economic development, tourism and environmental affairs MEC, assured those present that the programmes were not meant to squeeze out big businesses. We want to work with them, Zikalala said. He also cautioned against corruption. This is not for your government officials and your families and friends but for our poor people. The National African Federated Chamber of Commerce has welcomed Operation Vula and Radical Agrarian Socio-Economic Transformation as tools for transformation that will help black farmers.sihlem@thenewage.co.za
