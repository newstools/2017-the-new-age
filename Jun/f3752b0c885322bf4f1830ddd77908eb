Mexico manager Juan Carlos Osorio said Germany&#8217;s young squad are experienced and will not be underestimated when the teams meet in the Confederations Cup semi-finals on Thursday.Germany, the World Cup holders, and CONCACAF champions Mexico were unbeaten in their respective groups, each finishing with two wins and a draw in three matches.Germany have rested their more seasoned players for the two-week tournament in Russia that serves as a dress rehearsal for the 2018 World Cup, with coach Joachim Loew bringing several newcomers into a squad with an average age of just over 24.&#8220;I think we&#8217;re going to play against a team that can be a great example to follow for those who believe in processes, in development,&#8221; Osorio told a news conference on Wednesday.&#8220;I think being young and having experience are two different things.&#8221;He stressed that many of the Germany squad had extensive experience with the national team as well as from playing in the top European leagues and the Champions League.&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter if they&#8217;re young or not. What really matters is how much experience they have although they are young,&#8221; Osorio said.Loew told reporters on Wednesday he did not regret selecting such a young squad for the tournament because it served as a good opportunity to test their strengths.&#8220;It has worked really well as we&#8217;ve seen,&#8221; Loew said of his team&#8217;s performances so far.Mexico who finished second in Group A on seven points behind Portugal on goal difference knocked out hosts Russia with a 2-1 win in their final group match last week.Portugal face Chile in the first semi-final on Wednesday in Kazan for a place in Sunday&#8217;s final in Saint Petersburg.-Reuters
