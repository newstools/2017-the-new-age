The Department of Water and Sanitation will put a whole range of measures in place to mitigate the effects of the devastating drought that has ravaged most parts of South Africa, Minister of Water and Sanitation Nomvula Mokonyane said in her budget vote speech in Parliament last week.She said, however, that the drought in Western Cape that had seen dam levels fall to 19.02%, will take two to three years to recover.The Western Cape government last week announced the declaration of the province as a disaster area following the prolonged drought that has plunged the region into a water crisis.She said that as part of the drought interventions, early last year there was a potential threat of industries shutting down as a result of the severity of the drought in Richards Bay. Working in partnership with the municipality and the private sector, we are proud to say before this house, that a desalination plant that yields 10 million litres per day at a cost of R300m was constructed within a period of seven months, Mokonyane said.The plant operated at 60% energy efficiency. These volumes had been able to help the local government to receive 20 million litres of water from the private sector and redistribute it back to a populace of 175000 households. A nation as big and economically advanced as South Africa, is overly dependent on water transferred from Lesotho, particularly for our economic hub, Gauteng. We are now at phase two of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project that will augment the Vaal River System through the transfer of additional volumes of water from Lesotho, she said. The main features of phase two are the Polihali Dam and the expansion of the pipeline to Katse Dam. Through sound partnership with Lesotho, we have intensified our efforts to ensure that water will be available in storage in the new Polihali Dam as early as December 2024, and that water will be transferred to Katse Dam for delivery to South Africa by September 2025. Subsequent to the review of the procurement policies, in line with the treaty agreement in favour of South Africans and Basotho, there is now a 54% value in favour of advance infrastructure contracts to South African owned companies. Mokonyane identified non-revenue water (unaccounted for water) as a major problem that they were faced with.However, the implementation of the War on Leaks programme which was in the process of training 7500 youths as plumbers and water agents was one of the projects that was aimed at addressing water losses in the country.The minister said that water security had been skewed towards a reliance on surface water.South Africa was still heavily reliant on surface water and its further development with more than two thirds of the country s average annual runoff already stored in the country s dams.Groundwater is part of the water resources and the Department of Water and Sanitation is moving ahead with plans to ensure the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater.TNA Reporterprovinces@thenewage.co.za
