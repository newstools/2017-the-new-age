The Recording Industry of SA (Risa) has denied that it confirmed rapper Cassper Nyovest’s claim that his three albums, released between 2013 and 2017, have sold more than 10 million units. Early this week, the Tito Mboweni rapper took to Twitter to thank his fans for their support, after he had apparently learnt that he was South Africa’s top selling artist with 10 million records sold. “Dreams comes true, 10 million wow man. This plaque just got delivered to my house. “I’ve passed 10 million units sold in my career We have gone multi-platinum. This one is for the fans. Your support is truly amazing,” Nyovest tweeted, before Risa called him out for circulating unverified claims. Risa CEO and advocate Nhlanhla Sibisi denied having out-rightly pronounced the sales claims as being accurate but quickly said in an industry that has yet to include streaming and downloads into its monitoring system with a model to certify these kind of sales, it was difficult to say the rapper had achieved the milestone. “We are yet to have measures in place to monitor streaming services and such platforms into our monitoring system,” Sibisi said. “It is possible that Cassper Nyovest has sold the 10 million copies as in streaming language. “A single song can be said to be a record on its own. “The only record-breaking album sales are the ones that were achieved by Brenda Fassie who sold more than 500000 copies of her Vulindlela album. “Up until now no one has come close to that,” Sibisi said. Sibisi added the only people who have all the answers regarding the figures of the rapper’s sales, would be his record company, Family Tree. “Without having received any sales’ records, as Risa, Risa would could not dispute nor verify the claims. “Only he and his team can give us the full details of his records as we can’t verify without such records.” siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
