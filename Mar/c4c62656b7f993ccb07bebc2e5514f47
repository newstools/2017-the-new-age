Police on Monday found another eight bodies on Monday in Benoni. Fourteen bodies have been found in the last two days.While the police have not determined the reason for the deaths, a local zama zama (as illegal miners are commonly known) has linked to a turf war between illegal miners.The New Age reported on Monday that an illegal miner who claimed he knew some of the dead, said zama zamas were fighting over territory in the East Rand mostly involving disused mines.The Zimbabwean, who wanted to remain anonymous, claimed that the six were killed by another group of zama zamas. There are continuous fights between Zulus who are ring leaders and Zimbabweans. The fight started on Friday when one of us went underground and was forced to pay the security guards. When he tried to leave they shot him in the hand, he said. He claimed miners were killed underground and dragged out before being thrown into the bushes.Police confirmed there were no blood trails next to the bodies indicating the miners were killed elsewhere. Most of the ring leaders around Benoni are from KZN. They fight people who come into their territory. This is becoming dangerous. Many zama zamas are angry. They don t care and will fight for their lives. Police must come out in numbers or just close the holes, the illegal miner said. Police spokesperson confirmed that all had been shot.-TNA reporter
