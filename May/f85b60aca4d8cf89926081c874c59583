It Is up to the Ajax Cape Town players to secure a top eight finish and not Stanley Menzo. Ajax coach Menzo said his players have assumed full responsibility for the team s top eight goal, which would see them qualify for next season s MTN 8, having vowed to win the remaining four matches, which started with a 1-0 victory over Chippa United at the weekend.Ajax are joint on 32 points with ninth-place Golden Arrows, who dropped down following their 1-1 draw with Kaizer Chiefs. The Urban Warriors now have key fixtures against Bloemfontein Celtic, Orlando Pirates and Baroka to complete what has truly been a topsyturvy season. I m not going to do anything about the top eight. The players will have to do it, Menzo said. They have said, coach for the last four games, we are going for the wins. It s up to us . So, yes, it s up to them now. Menzo has been under tremendous pressure to turn around the season for Ajax since he took over midway through the season and a top eight finish would constitute an achievement for the Dutchman. Ajax showed great determination when they edged Chippa at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium, a place which has proved difficult for many visiting teams to come out victorious.It really was edgy for the Warriors, who got the winning goal through Thabo Mosadi late in the match. It was no easy field to play on, but I think if you look at the entire match, we deserved to win. There were pretty tense moments towards the end, but we dominated, had more chances and opportunities. Midfielder Mark Mayambela has targeted former club Pirates, their closest rivals in the top eight race. Ajax leapfrogged the Buccaneers, who played against Sundowns late yesterday and the two sides will meet in the penultimate match of the season. We are not giving up on a top eight finish but there is still a lot that can happen between now and the end of the season, Mayambela said. Ajax will next host Celtic at Athlone Stadium on Saturday.-KGOMOTSO SETHUSHA|kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
