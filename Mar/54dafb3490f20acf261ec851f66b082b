Even though 2016 saw the South African refrigerated freight (reefer) market contract by about 3%, largely due to lower crop yields of citrus caused by the drought, it still makes up about 19% of total local container exports.This is according to Matthew Conroy, trade manager of Maersk Line Southern Africa, who said the reefer trade (refrigerated cargo solutions) sector contributes to the local economy job creation and stimulating economic growth.The sector connects South Africa s agriculture sector to the world. SA s moderate climate makes it the ideal location for fruit farming, which makes up more than 90% of total reefer exports, Conroy said. The majority of produce exported via reefer containers from SA is fruit, mainly citrus and deciduous varieties. Citrus fruits such as lemons and oranges make up the bulk of this trade, about 58% while deciduous fruits such as apples, pears and grapes make up about 35%. Citrus crops are sourced throughout the country, while deciduous crops are found mainly in the Western Cape. Maersk Line Southern Africa has more than 80 years of experience in shipping fresh produce.In contrast to the thriving export trade, Conroy said reefer imports for SA are very low in single digits. Because of the imbalance, we bring thousands of empty reefer containers into South Africa to service our strong export market. He said in terms of demand, Europe receives close to 60% of SA s refrigerated exports, a market which has been consistent over time. Our biggest importer region is the EU, which receives around 35%, while the UK and Russia receive about 15% and 7% respectively. Others are Asia (17%), the Middle East (16%), intra-Africa (5%) and North America (4%). Conroy said moderate growth can be expected this year. South African fruit is in high demand globally, so market decline is more a reflection of the reduced crop output associated with the drought.SELLO RABOTHATAsellor@thenewage.co.za
