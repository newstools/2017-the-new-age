Over thirty children have been brutally murdered in the Western Cape since the beginning of the year.DA Western Cape spokesperson on community development Lorraine Botha said that so far thirty three children have been murdered in the province this year.&#8220;One child killed is one too many, and we cannot let perpetrators murder our children within our communities and get away with it,&#8221; said Botha.Botha expressed the unsettle, intensifying culture of kids murdering incidents. This cannot be justified anyway and cannot be seen as the norm. In fact it is completely unacceptable that our children are being killed when we all ought to be protecting them said Botha.With the recent attacks against children a three-year-old Courtney Pieters is one of the victims who was murdered in Cape Town in May.Pieters body was found in a shallow grave in the Epping Industrial centre after she went missing in front of her home in Elsies River.Even though Pieters&#8217;s suspected killer remain behind bars as the case was postponed until August, Botha said she will be talking to relevant people to ask what is being done to curb child killings in the province and also to follow up on how far along the arrests and convictions are of the guilty persons. I will be writing to the Ministers of Social Development and Community Safety Albert Fritz and Dan Plato to inquire about the measures that have been put in place to protect our children from the continued spate of murders. Furthermore I will inquire if perpetrators pertaining to these murders have been arrested and successfully convicted said Botha.In another gruesome discovery five-year-old Minentle Lekhakha was found by the Strand residents in Cape Town killed with her eyes gouged out.Botha says residents must be vigilant at all times and take fight against child slaughtering. As residents we must always be vigilant making sure that we remain informed about our children s whereabouts and the people with whom they spend their time. We must also be mindful of the adults and people we expose our children to knowing that some have questionable morals said Botha.Western Cape police have confirmed that quite a number of kids have been murdered in the province, however due to a national moratorium, crime statistics cannot be released.-TNA Reporter &nbsp;&nbsp;
