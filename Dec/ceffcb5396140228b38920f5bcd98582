Rapper Nicki Minaj has hit back at the critics who slammed her for saying that it’s a ‘great time to be a white rapper in America’. A number of social media users slammed Minaj when she posted the comment, calling her a ‘racist’. But Minaj hit back saying that she is blocking all ‘you sensitive d**k riders’. “It is a great time to be a white rapper in America! I want to sign one for my new labels. You know anyone? I speak my mothaf***in mind and if you don’t like it get off my page d**k riders.” Minaj made the white rapper comment on her Instagram account on hip-hop/rap songs chart on Sunday. She wrote: “It’s a great time to be a white rapper in America, huh? These are the top 10 rap songs on US iTunes… Congratulations to Em (Eminem) on his new album.” The post immediately sparked a debate with many fans supporting Minaj’s decision to call attention to the white rappers, but others criticised her for singling out white rappers.
