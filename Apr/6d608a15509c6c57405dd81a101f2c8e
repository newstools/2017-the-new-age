Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has ordered the police to ensure that axed Hawks head General Berning Ntlemeza returns the car he took on Monday.Mbalula said Ntlemeza needed to do this as he was longer the head of the Hawks as per the order of the High Court of Pretoria.Ntlemeza on Monday reported for duty in Pretoria at the Hawks headquarters and later ordered the head of supply chain management to give him a car. He is also in possession of a work cell-phone.Mbalula said that acting police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane should ensure that the phone and car are returned, failing which a warrant of arrest would be issued.The Police Minister did not mince his words while discussing Ntlemeza&#8217;s status at the Hawks and his defiance of the court order.&#8220;I didn&#8217;t chase Ntlemeza out of work. It is the courts which have decided and we must respect the law,&#8221; said MbalulaThe minister also highlighted that he had no personal gripe with Ntlemeza and was merely acting in accordance with the law.Mbalula said Ntlemeza&#8217;s attempt to enter the Hawks&#8217; headquarters was &#8220;unlawful&#8221; and says legal action will be taken against the former head.Two weeks ago the North Gauteng High dismissed his application for leave to appeal which meant he had to vacate his office with immediate effect.Ntlemeza was appointed permanently to the position by former Police Minister Nathi Nhleko in September 2015, despite Judge Elias Matojane having found that the General lacks integrity and honour and had lied under oath.Mbalula on Monday further criticised Ntlemeza for the way he was dealing with his dismissal saying that when Robert Mcbride was removed as the head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) he approached the courts to be reinstated.Mbalula also said General Yoliswa Matakata, who he appointed as acting head of the Hawks, was the only person who currently hold authority over the crime fighting unit.-TNA Reporter
