Police Minister Fikile Mbalula says his department and the Transvaal Agricultural Union (TAU) are working together on a strategy to address farm killings. Mbalula released a statement on the matter earlier today. The minister has met with TAU leaders as part of various meetings with stakeholders to resolve the issue. Mbalula said that in the meetings, his department and the TAU agreed that farm killings must be a priority and that the police need to create a conducive environment for farmers to produce and ensure food security for all South Africans. The police minister emphasised the importance of cooperation and coordination between the police and farmers, especially at a station level. TAU president Louis Meintjes said South Africa does not need violence but more police visibility on farms and the union is more than willing to work with the police. Mbalula said a national imbizo would be held before the end of the year to clearly discuss plans to operationalise the Rural Safety Strategy. Police officers who work in offices will be deployed with reservists to multiply force during the festive season as a response to the farm killings and for the general safety of South Africans. -TNA Reporter
