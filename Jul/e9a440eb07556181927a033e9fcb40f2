Publishers of the controversial book Mandela s Last Years have pulled it from the shelves and immediately stopped issuing copies.Penguin Random House South Africa (PRHSA) yesterday confirmed the move saying it was done out of respect for the late Mr Mandela s family .This comes after threats by former president Nelson Mandela s widow, Gra a Machel, to sue his doctor, Dr Vejay Ramlakan, who wrote the book.The South African National Defence Force physician led the medical team treating Mandela in the months before his death. His book details episodes of the end of the former statesman s life and the bitter family squabbles related to his health.PRHSA said it accepted Mandela s Last Years for publication after the author, Ramlakan, advised them that he had been asked by his family to publish it. The book was meant to portray Nelson Mandela s courage and strength until the very end of his life and was in no way intended to be disrespectful. However, given the statements from family members, we have decided to withdraw the book, PRHSA said in a statement.Meanwhile, the South African Medical Association has condemned the author, saying any patient-related information within the doctor-patient relationship was sacrosanct and must be respected, even after death.-MTHOKOZISI DUBE
