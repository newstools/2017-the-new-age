ANY coach who storms out of his coaching box as his team’s struggles continue is one who cannot be trusted with leading any side to a World Cup. Allister Coetzee, struggling to keep his job as Springboks coach, could not take it any more when Wales defeated the Boks 24-22 on Saturday. After all, no one was naive enough to believe there has been significant improvement this year after a torrid 2016 season. As Coetzee prepared to face the media this morning at the OR Tambo International Airport, the beleaguered coach has already said that he will not vacate his post. The fact that the Boks seem unable to get closer to the All Blacks, can’t beat Australia and lost by a record margin against Ireland doesn’t seem to bother Coetzee. Even with a review of the season and his position as coach coming up, Coetzee refused to throw in the towel. “I am signed for 2019, that is what my contract says. You cannot expect to build Rome in one day. Last year was a fiasco, definitely, so we started from scratch this year,” Coetzee said. “The players are much better conditioned so there is already progress. The players are hurting at the moment because they feel they let themselves down.” -MMASEKEPE MATSEBANE
