More homes are being resold for less than their previous purchase price but the trend is moderate by historic standards, John Loos, household and property strategist at FNB Home Loans, said yesterday. At any given time, there is a certain amount of residential price deflation in the market, a situation where a home is resold for less than the seller paid. In a country such as ours, with its significant general economy-wide inflation levels, consumer price inflation and wage inflation, the percentage of homes experiencing price deflation over the period between purchase and resale is normally small. However, it is not insignificant, and can fluctuate noticeably over the course of the property and economic cycle, Loos said.He said given that most homes are resold a good number of years following their original purchase, it stands to reason that most homes achieve at least some cumulative growth in value. Therefore, the large majority (87.7%) of total properties as at January sold for more than their purchase price, 73.6% at 110% or more than previous purchase price, 8.6% at 105%- 109% of previous purchase price, and 5.5% at 100%-104% of the previous purchase price.By comparison, 12.3% of the properties were sold for prices below the previous purchase price in January, 2.9% at 0%-5% below previous purchase price and 9.4% at more than 5% below the previous purchase price. As a result of a reasonably solid period in the housing market in recent years, up until at least early 2016, this 12.3% estimate for homes selling below prior purchase price is still a relatively moderate percentage by historic standards. By comparison, shortly following the recession and interest rate peak of 2008-9, the estimated percentage of such resale price deflation peaked at 23.5% of homes sold in September 2009, with 20.6% selling at more than 5% below the previous purchase price. From a low of 9.8% of properties selling below the original purchase price in August 2016, the percentage has risen mildly to 12.3% of total properties sold in January 2017.This is the lagged impact of those earlier 200 basis points worth of interest rate hikes from early 2014 to early 2016, along with a broad economic growth stagnation from 2012 to 2016. These figures also serve to dispel the myth that property values can only go up . At any given time, a portion of them don t. -Sello Rabothata|sellor@thenewage.co.za
