The one-month-old baby girl was found in the early hours of Sunday morning at the Marianhill toll plaza, when the police saw a suspicious car.Acting National Commissioner Lieutenant General Khomotso Phahlane said they are happy that the baby was found alive. We, as the South African Police Service (SAPS), are extremely grateful that this innocent baby has been rescued from dubious situation to say the least, He said in a statement.Phahlane thanked the police, all other law enforcement agencies, security companies who assisted in the search and civic-minded members of the public who joined forces to assist the search. The SAPS invested a lot on the case to ensure the safe return of the baby, including members working overtime. We are a wonderful and caring society but it is disappointing when people take advantage of their fellow South African s trust and belief in humanity. False claims of crimes which have an entire nation and beyond in a state of sorrows and anxiety, should be condemned, said Phahlane.Since the kidnapping the baby has been placed in the care of social development.Their next court appearance is on May 9. -TNA Reporter
