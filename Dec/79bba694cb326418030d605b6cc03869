The case against two Hawks members and SAPS detectives accused of conniving and stealing R1 million in an armed robbery in Edenvale and Hillbrow has been postponed to 27 December. Warrant officers Tefo Maimane (49, Eric Mehlaphi (41) and Detective Constable Khombulo Gadivhana (36) appeared at the Johannesburg Magistrate Court for a formal bail application. The fourth suspect is still outstanding and efforts to track him down are currently underway. Gauteng Head of the Hawks Major General Prince Mokotedi said the trio was arrested by the Serious Corruption Unit, following allegations that in September four police officials stopped a vehicle in Noorwood alleging that the driver was driving recklessly. “The driver insisted that they proceed to the Police Station, where a search was conducted and the police allegedly found two boxes full of money and a receipt indicating the total amount the victim had exchanged for his employer.” Mokotedi added that the suspects allegedly left the police precinct and continued to Johannesburg Specialised Commercial Crimes Court building where they offloaded the two boxes. “The police entered one of the offices, shared the R1 million and returned the remaining money to the driver.” Mokotedi expressed his gratitude and congratulated the serious corruption unit for arresting their own. Since the zero tolerance to corruption was implemented they have arrested 102 police officials in Gauteng from March 2016 to date. “I want to warn unscrupulous members that we will not relax until the Hawks, particularly in Gauteng, gets rid of all the bad elements. The blue wall is greatly impeding our success to tackle organised crime. Once broken, our progress to bust crime syndicates will be accelerated,” he said. -TNA Reporter
