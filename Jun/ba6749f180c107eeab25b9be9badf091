Almost 270000 parents are seeking space for grades 1 and 8 for 2018.The Gauteng department of education yesterday confirmed that 147779 applications had been received for primary schools and 121897 for high school entry.Ahead of the deadline for applications at midnight yesterday, they had already received 59921 more applications than last year. Once more, we thank the people of Gauteng for the overwhelming response to the online admissions. The early processing of admissions means that learning and teaching can commence on the first day of the 2018 academic calendar, education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said.Department spokesperson Oupa Bodibe said the significant increase in the number of applications during the last week of the application period was notable. Bulk SMSs were forwarded to all parents who had not yet applied for Grade 1 and/or Grade 8 for the 2018 pupil intake, Bodibe said.He said the department would monitor schools with low application numbers. The number of schools with less than 50 applications had decreased from 636 on May 22 to 402 schools on June 9.He said the reasons for the low turnout included the poor quality of education in rural areas and townships. Johannesburg received the largest number of applications, with 102419 submitted, followed by Ekurhuleni with 79779 applications.The Sediwest region had the lowest number of applications, sitting at 43112.Out of 11 most sought after schools, 10 of them were high schools. Laerskool Akasia, with 1308 applications, is the only primary school with more than 1200 applications.Boksburg High School and Ho rskool Akasia are the two most popular schools in the province, having received 1525 applications each.The department said the six districts in the province would address the overflow of pupils by transferring some to schools with low applications, arranging scholar transport for those who cannot find placement close to home and speeding up the building of schools. The placement period commences on July 24, 2017. Once parents receive an offer of placement, they are advised to accept or reject. If parents do not respond, the offer will be given to other parents in the queue, Bodibe said.LILLIAN SELAPISAlillians@thenewage.co.za
