Having achieved almost everything with Kaizer Chiefs domestically, the only medal missing in Siphiwe Tshabalala s collection is a CAF gold medal.The CAF Champions League is a competition Tshabalala and his teammates have failed to impress in on two previous occasions. They were knocked out early in 2015 and 2016. However, 32-year-old Tshabalala wants to win the Champions League before he hangs up his boots. Shabba said he is inspired by Mamelodi Sundowns Champions League success last year and believes Chiefs will do the same this season. It s every footballer s dream to play at the highest level and compete with the best out there, Tshabalala said. I also want to play and compete in Africa. I played there twice and it never worked out but CAF is something which every player wants to participate in. Sundowns have inspired a lot of teams and players. There is the need and hunger to compete on the continent successfully. But Shabba s focus, for now, is to help Amakhosi to win the double at the end of the season.Chiefs are in the race for the league title and also in the running to win the Nedbank Cup. I chose this football career and am not here to add to the numbers. I am here to add value and leave an impact by contributing to the club s success so that I leave a proud legacy. There is no better way to do that than winning trophies and winning the league. For me, I also have a responsibility to play well all the time, help the team and contribute the best way that I can and by doing that the rewards will be big and we will definitely win the sought after trophies.
