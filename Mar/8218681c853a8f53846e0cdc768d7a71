The entrance or the inclusion of independent power producers (IPPs) to the energy sphere is pure privatisation brought to Eskom through the back door.Our country is under serious attack from a neo-liberal agenda that seeks to undermine the gains of our liberation since 1994. The NUM has noted that the decision to partially privatise Eskom has already been taken without our involvement.The difference between the cost of renewable energy generated by IPPs and the electricity generated by Eskom could adversely affect the utility s balance sheet.During deliberations at the Eskom shop stewards council, the NUM came to the conclusion that as much as we support green energy we cannot ignore scientific facts that green energy is not as cheap as it is portrayed to be by capitalists.We know that capitalism is about profit maximisation. The capitalist class will go to the extent of misleading society for only profit maximisation.We have further noted that green energy is not even reliable. It doesn t have the capacity to replace the base load as presently subjectively portrayed.The sun doesn t shine every day and also the wind doesn t blow every day.We have a problem with the selective and subjective bias that opportunistically purports the renewable energy as the alpha and omega for South Africa while completely turning a blind eye to the realities that these renewables can t be used as base loads.An independent power producer or non-utility generator is an entity which is not a public utility, but which owns facilities to generate electric power for sale to utilities and end users.What is going to happen if the sun does not shine and also when the wind does not blow? We will definitely have blackouts.South Africa had blackouts in 2008 and 2009 mainly because of the interference of politicians in scientific decisions of Eskom.We appeal as the NUM that politicians must leave scientific decisions to scientists. The NUM agrees that there should be a reduction in greenhouse gases and strengthened efforts to introduce renewable energy, but should not result in retrenchments.We have identified the following impact to South Africa due to the introduction of IPPs: That there is going to be major retrenchments of our members in the energy and mining sector; IPPs are not labour intensive; That they are more expensive than coal; That there is no social labour plan associated with the decision to introduce IPPs; That the whole supply chain in the coal industry will be affected; That it will affect the public in that they will have to pay more for electricity directly and indirectly.We have therefore concluded that we will have a national march to begin as soon as possible to protest against the inclusion of IPPs into the national grid.The action will include mass action and educating the public on the real impact of the IPPs on the price of electricity.The inclusion of IPPs means that Eskom must pay more for the commodity that we can produce for cheaper prices.If Eskom agrees, the long-term impact of this might result in Eskom becoming bankrupt and being sold to the highest bidder.On the decision by the power utility to close down five power stations (Hendrina, Kriel, Komati, Grootvlei and Camden), the NUM views that as senseless, irrational, malicious and an attack on the ordinary voters.It is a decision that is only aimed at pursuing narrow and selfish business interests which is none other than the neo-liberal agenda.The NUM wishes to sensitise the government that closure of these power stations will cost South Africa about 30000 jobs, which is contrary to the government s NDP objectives of fighting the triple challenges of unemployment, poverty and inequality.While we are mindful of the need to deal with climate change, IPPs cannot be implemented at the expense of massive job losses.Workers from those power stations will suffer as a result from the poverty that will confront the surrounding communities.-David Sipunzi
