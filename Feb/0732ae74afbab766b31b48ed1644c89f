Pro-Makhado demarcation task team leader Nsovo Sambo, said residents preferred that the suspended services be rendered by the Makhado municipality. Residents have been under Makhado municipality all along and that is what they want, Sambo said.Some residents said they would stop at nothing other than the reversal of the incorporation of Vuwani into Lim 345 municipality claiming they never demanded the new municipality. They said they were comfortable with the area being administered by Makhado municipality in Louis Trichardt.While Lim 345 municipality was being rejected in Vuwani, residents of Malamulele were happy that their area was under a new municipal entity that came to life following the August 3, 2016 municipal elections.Before that, the Malamulele residents too were waging violent protests demanding that their area be removed from Thulamela municipality in Thohoyandou and be administered by a new municipal entity.MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
