The DA says it’s closely following developments relating to the alleged abuse of public funds by the city of Cape Town Executive Mayor Patricia De Lille. The party says it is determined to have all allegations investigated fully and without any fear or favour, by a totally independent investigator. The announcement was made after ANC Dullah Omar region Chairperson Xolani Sotashe announced that he planned to table a motion of no confidence against the mayor. In October, it was reported that De Lille used public money to do renovations at her home. De Lille has since denied the claims. Sotashe said he would be going to the Provincial Legislature to table a motion. “I am currently out of Cape Town but tomorrow morning I will be back to submit all relevant documents that are needed,” Sotashe said. He said the ANC hoped the motion would be tabled soon. “We are hoping that by Tuesday next week, the motion will take place.” -TNA Reporter
