JSE-Llisted tile and sanitaryware specialist Italtile yesterday announced a turnover increase of 4% for the six months ended June. Italtile is a retail leader of porcelain and ceramic tiles, sanitaryware, taps, bathroom furniture and accessories.Its outlets include CTM and TopT. With leading indicators showing that the socio-political and economic conditions will prevail in the remaining months, Italtile expects real disposable income to decline further in the context of poor economic growth, limited job creation and significant increases in personal income taxes for middle and high-income earners. Country-specific risk will also remain a factor for the forthcoming period and management anticipates a weakening trend of the local currency, Italtile said. Despite this contextual outlook, the group remains confident that its strong brands as well as robust and resilient business model can capitalise on growth opportunities in this market. The group s goal is to open 20 new stores over the next financial year, including at least one Italtile retail store and three CTM stores, it said yesterday. In addition to expanding the capacity of the business, opportunities for growth also exist within the business itself, through improved competencies, efficiencies, and conceptualisation of retail innovations and market-disruptive strategies, Italtile said. The company increased revenue from R3.54bn to R3.67bn and improved gross profit by 5% to R1.49bn, while trading profit came in 2% higher at R1.06bn. Profit attributable to owners grew by 4% to R845m. Despite the improvements, headline earnings a share came in at 1.4% lower at 85.7c.-NONHLANHLA MASEKO|business@thenewage.co.za
