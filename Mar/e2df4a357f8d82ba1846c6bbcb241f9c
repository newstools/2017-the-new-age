Drake&#8217;s new album has set a record for the best first day on Spotify, edging out Ed Sheeran who held the title for a mere two weeks.The Toronto hip-hop star on Saturday dropped &#8220;More Life,&#8221; a 22-song collection that ventures deeper into the dancehall sounds of Jamaica and features appearances by other leading rappers.A Spotify spokeswoman said that &#8220;More Life&#8221; was played 61,302,082 times on its first full day Sunday, topping the 56,727,861 streams on March 3 for English songwriter Sheeran&#8217;s &#8220;Divide.&#8221;Spotify, the world&#8217;s largest streaming platform, has some 100 million listeners including on its free tier.Drake also broke the record for the most overall streams by an artist on a single day, again beating Sheeran.Tracking service Nielsen Music separately forecast that &#8220;More Life&#8221; would make the biggest debut so far this year on the Billboard chart of US album sales.The success of &#8220;More Life&#8221; comes even though Drake has described it as a &#8220;playlist&#8221; to hold time between releases of full-fledged albums.Unlike his album &#8220;Views&#8221; last year, Drake released &#8220;More Life&#8221; immediately on all streaming platforms rather than giving an initial exclusive to Apple Music, with which he has a close relationship.Spotify records have repeatedly been broken as a growing number of listeners turn to streaming, which allows unlimited, on-demand music online.-AFP
