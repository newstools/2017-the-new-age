A war of words has erupted between City of Joburg Mayor Herman Mashaba and the South African Municipal Workers Union (SAMWU) following allegations of corruption at licensing centres around the City.On Tuesday Mayor Mashaba announced that the city of Johannesburg s Anti-Corruption Unit led by Richard Sibiya had arrested seven licencing centre officials who will face corruption charges when they appear in court.According to Mashaba the unit has identified 106 allegedly corrupt licencing centre officials who will be arrested in the coming days.SAMWU has on Friday accused Mashaba of &#8220;sensationalising&#8221; the matter, adding that the allegations made against the identified officials are yet to be proven.&#8220;We implore the mayor to desist from using these allegations against our members to elevate the political performance of Mr. Sibiya without any merit,&#8221; said SAMWU Gauteng Provincial Secretary Caleb Mokoena in a statement.Mokoena added they are of an educated view that both the criminal and internal allegations will not be sustained in any fair enquiry and we will support our members until the conclusion of such processes.However Mashaba hit back at the union saying SAMWU was attempting to discredit the City&#8217;s efforts to deal with corruption.&#8220;We have not disclosed any of the names of the implicated employees to protect their rights.&#8220;If SAMWU was serious about their fight against corruption, they would back the new administration and our zero-tolerance approach to corruption,&#8221; he said.The spat between the two comes after Mashaba on Tuesday announced that between January 2008 and February 2016, 972 alleged fraudulent transactions of R14.7m were identified within the city of Johannesburg.Mashaba said syndicates would collude with licencing officials to perform illegal transactions on the computer system. This included collusion to unlawfully allow motorists to obtain drivers licenses, disc licenses and to register vehicles.Licencing officials would then pocket cash that would have ordinarily been paid to the city and utilised for much needed service delivery.However SAMWU has defended its members arguing that, &#8221; In most instances the allegations are primarily about policy deviations on the part of our members and such are informed by operational reasons.&#8221;&#8220;These cannot be construed to infer criminal intent and we find it unacceptable for the mayor to create a media frenzy over the issue and for the Hawks to make this an alleged priority crime, &#8221; Mokoena said.Mashaba however later appeared to extend an olive branch to SAMWU saying that he wants to partner with SAMWU to combat corruption.&#8220;I invite SAMWU to challenge us in terms of us dealing with cases that they may find uncomfortable or unclear. Our doors are open,&#8221; Mashaba said.-TNA Reporter
