German Chancellor Angela Merkel is &#8220;horrified&#8221; by the attack on the Borussia Dortmund football team and wishes the side luck in its match later Wednesday, her spokesman said.&#8220;The chancellor was, like the people of Dortmund and millions of people everywhere, horrified by the news of the attack on the BVB team bus,&#8221; the spokesman, Steffen Seibert, told reporters.&#8220;It is a repugnant act. We are only relieved that it did not have more severe consequences,&#8221; he added, praising the &#8220;calm&#8221; response of the fans in the stadium.-AFP
