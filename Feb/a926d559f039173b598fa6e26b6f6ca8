LEGENDARY reggae icon Bob Marley, would have turned 72 on Monday.The Jamaican singer, song writer and music legend died on May 11, 1981, after a long battle with acral lentiginous melanoma (skin cancer).He was 36 years old when he lost his life at a Miami hospital. His last words, according to media reports at the time, to his son, Ziggy, were: Money can t buy life. This was after the cancer had spread to his lungs and brain. This year, the 36th anniversary of his death coincides with the 36 years Marley had been alive.There were a variety of programmes and tributes held in his honour across the globe. But the biggest tribute of all has been the recent discovery of his music in a London hotel basement.After more than 30 years since his death, this bit of news will be welcomed by fans of the man born Robert Nesta Marley, who should be pleased that a piece of history worthy to be celebrated has been found after more than 40 years in a damp London hotel basement.There are not many musical stars who have captured the imagination of world music lovers, such as Marley, Tupac and a few others, whose posthumous work gets people overly excited.So, here s to an exciting and epochmaking 2017, which will give fans of these two musical greats a bit excitement as they anticipate the release of Bob Marley s musical archives and the much anticipated Tupac bio pic, All Eyes of Me, slated for June 16 release.The 13 reel-to-reel, analogue master tapes were discovered in cardboard box files in a run-down hotel in Kensal Rise, north-west London the modest lodgings where Bob Marley and the Wailers stayed during their European tours in the mid-1970s.The tapes known as the lost masters among elements of Marley s huge fanbase were at first believed to be ruined beyond repair, due to water damage.But after working tirelessly to restore them using the latest audio techniques, the master reels have been restored, with the sound quality of Marley described as enough to send shivers down one s spine .The tapes are said to be the original live recordings of Marley s concerts in London and Paris between 1974 and 1978, and feature some of his most famous tracks including No Woman No Cry, Jammin , Exodus and I Shot the Sheriff.The recordings, which were made using the Rolling Stones 24-track Mobile Studio, were severely water damaged and believed to be irreparable.It s unclear what Gatt has planned for the restored tapes. Some of the live recordings are already readily available Marley s gig at London s Lyceum in 1975 was released that year as Live!A deluxe edition of that live album packed with two complete Lyceum shows was released last December.Another concert found was a gig at London s Rainbow in 1977.Siyabonga Sithole
