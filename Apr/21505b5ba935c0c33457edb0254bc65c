I only have two eyes. If only I had 10 eyes I would know so now I am relying on what I am told, he said.Mogoeng was not amused. I have a problem in the manner in which you make light of serious things and these are serious things that affect the judiciary. You are there making jokes of things which discredit the judiciary, the chief justice said.Nhlangalula then toned down his response and apologised. I am sorry, chief justice, he said.For the Northern Cape, the JSC recommend judge Pule Tlaletsi as the next judge president of the Northern Cape High Court.In the North West, the commission said it would recommend Tebogo Djaje to be appointed as a judge in the North West High Court.The JSC also recommend to the president that justice Raymond Zondo was suitable to be deputy chief justice and that justice Mandisa Maya was suitable to be president of the Supreme Court of Appeal.If appointed, Maya would be the first woman president of the Supreme Court of Appeal, the second highest court in South Africa.During all the interviews, the main challenges that judges said they faced was transformation in the judiciary, both in gender and race.Statistics gathered in March 2016 provide a visual summary of the race and gender transformation in the superior courts of South Africa.There are 255 judges which 145 are male and 82 are females.
