The provincial department of human settlements has vowed to constantly monitor the building of RDP houses and other projects to prevent the illegal occupation and poor construction of houses.This said this to the MEC Speedy Mashilo to the provincial legislature and residents.This was during the temporary sitting of the provincial house at the Themba Senamela Stadium in Mhluzi township near Middelburg last week.Mashilo said the provincial government was concerned about such behaviour continuing as it disturbed the government s mission to deliver viable services. Practical and constant project monitoring by government low cost housing beneficiaries could prove vital in tackling illegal occupation of houses and realising quality projects, Mashilo said.He said beneficiaries of the RDP shelters deserved a chance to express their sentiments about their preferred location. The majority of houses were left unoccupied since they were built in places the beneficiaries did not like. Beneficiaries should be engaged and showed their sites beforehand. This is to enable them to monitor the building progress, eliminating illegal occupation and untraceable beneficiary challenges, Mashilo said.There were a few challenges faced by the department due to unlawful invasions. The department was working hard to overcome those problems. We have resolved to start with our beneficiary list to ensure when a house has been approved, the processes of title deeds should begin. The department has a clear mission to service sites before the start of a project. We have taken a decision to allow every beneficiary to see their houses from the initial processes of construction to the last stage, Mashilo said.FRANCE NYAKAfrancen@thenewage.co.za
