The family of a black motorist fatally shot by a Minnesota police officer, whose dying moments were livestreamed on Facebook, said Monday it had reached a nearly $3 million civil settlement with the US city that employed the acquitted cop.The death of Philando Castile &#8212; one in a series of high-profile shootings of African-Americans by police &#8212; stunned the nation. His girlfriend Diamond Reynolds took to Facebook to livestream his agony as blood spread on Castile&#8217;s shirt and the officer continued to yell orders with his gun drawn.Jeronimo Yanez, 29, was found not guilty of manslaughter earlier this month for shooting the 32-year-old Castile during a traffic stop last year, after the driver informed the officer that he was carrying a gun, for which he had a legal permit.The $2.995 million settlement with St Anthony, a suburb of the state capital St Paul, avoids a federal civil rights lawsuit, &#8220;which may have taken years to work its way through the courts, exacerbating the suffering of the family and of the community,&#8221; according to a joint statement released Monday by the city and Castile family attorneys.&#8220;No amount of money could ever replace Philando,&#8221; the statement said, adding that the money &#8212; to be paid by the city&#8217;s insurance and not through taxpayer funds &#8212; would be used to fund a foundation in Castile&#8217;s name.Police car video of the shooting released last week shows the exchange between Yanez and Castile lasting less than a minute before the officer shoots Castile at close range.Following Yanez&#8217;s acquittal, St Anthony said it would no longer employ him as a police officer.The verdict, which sparked renewed protests in Minnesota, was the first of a string of three trials in one week in which US prosecutors failed to secure convictions of police officers in questionable shootings &#8212; revealing the difficulty of prosecuting such cases, even with video evidence.The trial of a former University of Cincinnati police officer accused of killing motorist Sam DuBose ended in a mistrial on Friday after the jury could not reach a unanimous decision.And a Wisconsin jury last week acquitted a former police officer in the murder of Sylville Smith, a 23-year-old man who was carrying a pistol during a brief foot chase that ended with Dominique Heaggan-Brown fatally shooting himAFP
