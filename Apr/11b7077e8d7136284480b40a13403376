The human rights of girls and women need to come under the spotlight during the South African Human Rights month, which includes March 21, the South African Day for Human Rights.March 21, which was initially coined as Sharpeville Day to commemorate the massacre of 69 people who were shot down by the apartheid forces as they peacefully protested against the detested pass laws.The month of March also includes another equally historic day where Russian women textile workers in Petrograd (St Petersburg) began a demonstration protesting about working conditions, food rations and the war.This was the event that gave impetus to the Russian Revolution. As a result of the women s action the Tsar abdicated and the government that was set up that year gave women the right to vote.In 2017 the UN Commission on the Status of Women held its 61st global conference under the priority theme, Women s Economic Empowerment In The Changing World Of Work.This is an important theme to pursue in 2017 where global statistics indicate that women only make 77 cents for every dollar men earn .In the developing world the wage inequalities are probably greater than the global average. The wage gap between men and women in South Africa is estimated to be 15-17%, the research conducted by the University of Johannesburg (UJ) in 2015 says.The research further simplifies its estimated finding by explaining that this means a South African woman would have to work two months more than a South African man to earn the same annual salary for the same job.Considering that women generally use their money to cover so many people in and outside their families, the deficiency in income has other emotional impacts.The losses of benefits and pensions have additional burdens for women as they tend to live longer than men and end up facing poverty due to being short-changed as a result of the wage gap.The male-dominated industries such as mining, manufacturing and construction still lag far behind in terms of wage equality.The impact of salary negotiations on women s salaries is minimal. Trade union organisations service their members within the confines of patriarchal societies, it is not far-fetched to think that this could be a blind spot that they need to consciously address.It is worth noting that Cosatu has declared 2017 the year of advancing working class women.This has already been borne out by the federation s resilience in advancing maternity protection cover to women employed in the informal sector.The employers and government need to come to the party to improve women s working conditions especially as women sacrifice so much in the reproduction of labour and society.Research from the UJ South African Board for People s Practices report says union negotiation teams are led mostly by men and that tends to perpetuate women s losses in the wage and benefit competition.It says sectors that are dominated by women tend to be underpaid. A case in point is nursing and teaching. These salaries are very low noting the educational investment that an average teacher and nurse deposits in their education and ongoing professional development.Women s labour, knowledge and skill is undervalued in our society resulting in the unfairness in compensation. When women change jobs, they are often offered lower salaries than men enjoyed in the same post.The improvement on a previous woman s salary is only marginal considering the added responsibility that one assumes. From the onset of a promotional post, women are short-changed by employers during the package negotiations.The research further says jobs in the service industries and government tend to be more equal when compared to similar jobs in the private sector. This in fact points to a need for closer monitoring of the private sector by all Chapter 9 institutions, in particular the Commission for Gender Equality.In the South African context, the relegation of the majority of women to the informal sector has relegated the majority of women to insecure jobs, lack of protection for maternity and lack of pension or provident fund benefits, which come back as a cost to the country s budget in later years and has negative impact on the country s human development indices.The apparent savings of employing women in precarious jobs and at a lower cost become compounded costs further down the line.The conference will also review the theme of the 58th conference, Challenges and achievements in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals for women and girls as well as the theme that focuses on the empowerment of indigenous women. It is thus difficult to look at just the economic factors that affect women, considering the intersection of social, economic and political factors in the perpetuation of gender inequality.Another urgent social issue that is supported by political and economic factors is the issue of gender-based violence (GBV). It is quite difficult to talk about women s position and status and gender inequality in South African society without touching on GBV considering that South Africa is considered to be the world leader in GBV.GBV is a great barrier to women s ability to access their rights. GBV is perpetrated by intimate partners and male family members. Women s and girls rights to health are the first to go in cases of GBV. This impacts on the victim of GBV, her family and the state because all these have to spend money to restore the woman to a healthy state.The health impact is emotional, mental, physical and increased anxiety and depression.Girls and women s rights to education are impeded when victims cannot go to school for fear of GBV or as a result of experiencing GBV. The attendant health problems affect a victim s ability to study freely and successfully. GBV also hinders girls and women s access to economic opportunities.When women are threatened with or are recovering from GBV it is often difficult to go to work or to participate in income-generating opportunities.Women are also subjected to the threat of GBV and the pain of GBV aimed at discouraging them from speaking up in community meetings and even voting. This makes it difficult to access the women s voices particularly in rural and traditional settings.Women who are exposed to GBV are often locked into their houses or homes and are barred from going anywhere and from receiving visitors, which takes away their right to move freely and to interact with their communities freely.Women who are exposed to GBV are often hindered from enjoying the rights contained in Chapter 2 of the Constitution, such as freedom of association where perpetrators of GBV bar them from going to religious institutions, visiting friends or maintaining relationships with friends, family and colleagues.The girls are also subjected to cyber bullying by perpetrators of GBV who circulate derogatory, scary and demeaning messages about them online. These behaviours are also favoured by former boyfriends and bar women from having peace of mind and having access to and making the most of the opportunities presented by technology for self-improvement and information about advancement and economic opportunities.As we review the gains of the democratic dispensation in the post- 94 landscape we need to improve the conditions for women in the workplace and in the economy. While there are improvements for some women economically speaking there are still too many women who are left outside decent work.For women who are starting businesses, there are still too many barriers to making a success of their initiatives starting with access to funding and mentoring.The high rates of GBV in South Africa affect women and girls, severely hindering a majority of women from participating freely in political, social and economic spheres.Women in leadership are often subjected to intimidation in the execution of their mandates and this is another area that requires further research for a coordinated response.Fundi NzimandeFundi Nzimande is a commissioner at the Commission of Gender Equity
