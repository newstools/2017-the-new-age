Striker Sergio Aguero says he is eager to win back his place in Manchester City&#8217;s starting line-up and it will be up to the Premier League club to decide whether to keep him once the season ends.Aguero, who is the club&#8217;s top scorer with 18 goals in 26 games this campaign, was left out for the second match in a row in favour of young Brazil forward Gabriel Jesus, who scored a brace in the 2-1 win at home to Swansea City on Sunday.&#8220;No, no, I don&#8217;t want to leave. I have to help the team as much as I can in these three months. Afterwards we&#8217;ll see what the club wants to do with me,&#8221; Aguero told British media when asked about his future.&#8220;In three years, my contract is up &#8211; that&#8217;s why I say I&#8217;m happy at the club. In these last three months that are left I have to help the club and, as I say, the club will decide if I have a place here or not.&#8220;Sometimes this happens. When you&#8217;re on the bench you have to wait for your opportunity. I have three months to do my best and try to help the team and we&#8217;ll see what happens with my future.&#8221;Aguero also felt he can learn a lot to from the 19-year-old Jesus.&#8220;He is a great player. He&#8217;s a very young player but he will learn a lot at City and he will have a great future at the club,&#8221; the Argentine said.&#8220;At the moment I have to watch what he does, to learn, it could be a little bit. I am how I am. I have spent a lot of years in Europe playing the same way.&#8221;City, who are third in the table, 10 points behind leaders Chelsea after 24 games, travel to face 14th-placed Bournemouth on Monday.-Reuters
