The EFF says it will not vote with the ANC in a motion of no confidence against Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba. The statement was made by EFF Deputy President Floyd Shivambu on Twitter ahead of the motion being debated at the Johannesburg City Council. “The EFF will not support any of the opportunist motions of no confidence brought by the ANC in the metros. Any rational and sensible South African will know that of all devils, the ANC in its present form is not an option and can’t be trusted with political power. They must go jump,” the tweet said.   This comes as Nelson Mandela Bay Mayor Athol Trollip and Mashaba both face motions of no confidence brought forward by the ANC today. In both the metros, the EFF’s vote in support or against the motion is expected to play a critical role. “The DA worked too hard to be the biggest party in council. We’ve also worked hard and made a big difference in 14 months. We won’t give in to two disgruntled councilors,” Trollip said. Meanwhile, DA Leader Mmusi Maimane led a march to in Johannesburg this morning, to support Mashaba.  “Mashaba is our mayor. He loves this city and he has sworn to make it a better place for everyone who lives here, works here or visits here. This motion of no confidence will fail and Mashaba will continue to do what he promised the people he’d do,” Maimane said.  -TNA Reporter
