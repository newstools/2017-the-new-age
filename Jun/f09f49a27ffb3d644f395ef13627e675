It has been five months since South African photographer Shiraaz Mohamed disappeared in Syria, but still no ransom has been demanded for his safe release.Mohamed was kidnapped in Syria in January this year when a group of unidentified armed men took him hostage while he was preparing to leave the war-torn country through the Turkish border.Soon after his abduction, it was announced that a team set to look into the case was established.Yemen national, Anas al Hamati from the Gift of the Givers who negotiated the release of Yolande Korkie, in 2014 is also part of the team.According to Sunday Times Gift of the Givers founder Imtiaz Sooliman said it is uncommon that no one has come forward to demand a ransom.Sooliman said Mohamed s kidnappers told the drivers from Gift of the Givers that they wanted to take him in for questioning to clear a misunderstanding and would return him to the hospital in 48 hours, he said.TNA Reporter
