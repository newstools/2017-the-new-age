The recent release of statistics by Statistics SA has shown that unemployment in the Eastern Cape is on the increase, with the youth unemployment reaching 32.2%, a 3.8% hike in the fourth quarter of 2016.The figures also revealed that young people were mostly affected by unemployment, with more than 60% youth being without a job.According to the quarterly Labour Force survey released by the Statistics South Africa, unemployment in the Eastern Cape has increased by 3.8 percentage points, from 28.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016 (October-December) to 32.2% in the first quarter of 2017 (January-March).DA MPL Bobby Stevenson said the figures were shocking, adding that this was one of the biggest quarterly unemployment jumps in the province in years. This is one of the biggest quarterly increases in unemployment in the province in years. It means that 110000 fewer people had work in the first quarter of 2017, totalling 684000 compared to 574000 people in the last quarter of 2016,&#8221; Stevenson said.He added: The devastating tragedy of these figures is that an additional 110 000 people are unable to put food on the table. This is devastating for the families that are involved. One of the steps needed to turn our economy around is to ensure our young people are equipped with skills that can get them jobs. This means that we need to fix our education system.&#8220;We need to create a climate in this province that is conducive to attracting investment. Only the private sector can create jobs. We need a province of entrepreneurs. The government must do its bit by eradicating corruption, fixing the infrastructure, improving safety, delivering services and governing well,&#8221; he said.TNA Reporter
