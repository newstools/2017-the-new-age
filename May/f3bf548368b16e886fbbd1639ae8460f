Police in Watervaal have launched a search for a motorist who failed to stop after knocking down two men along the Chavani-Bungeni road on Saturday morning.Police spokesperson Capt Mamphaswa Seabi said the two dead men believed to be in their 20s, who have since been taken to a state mortuary, were still unidentified by yesterday. The driver of the motor vehicle involved did not stop after the incident. As police we appeal to anyone who might have seen the incident to come forward or call crime stop number 0860010111 or visit Watervaal police station. We also request those who may identify the two victims to come forward as well, Seabi said.In another horrific crash, four people were killed on Sunday morning at Tom Beuke village in a collision involving a truck and a sedan. We have opened a culpable homicide case after four passengers of a white Polo Vivo were certified dead on the scene. No one sustained injuries in the truck. The process of identifying the dead is progressing and their names will be released once their next of kin are informed, Seabi said.The provincial transport and community safety department spokesperson, Joshua Kwapa, said most of the weekend crashes were due to human errors. We are saddened by this carnage in one weekend. It is unfortunate that despite traffic officers deployed during weekends many people continue to ignore road safety rules. Factors which mostly cause road accidents include drunk driving, excessive speed, negligent or reckless driving and fatigue, Kwapa said.Pedestrian deaths also continued to be a big concern. Many of the pedestrians were killed while crossing roads, an indication that some may not have observed safety factors before crossing, he said. The department said it would improve on its education programmes on pedestrian safety.MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
