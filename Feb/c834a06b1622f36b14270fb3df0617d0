The rate of drug abuse in the Northern Cape has increased so much that the government has now decided to build rehabilitation and treatment centres across the province.The social development department said the centres should give hope to the people of the province, especially the youth.The announcement was made by President Jacob Zuma during his state of the nation address in Parliament last week.The Northern Cape is one of the provinces with a high rate of drug and alcohol abuse, which contributes to the escalating crime rate in and around the province.Zuma said the government was working with society to ensure they fight the social ills that continue to tear communities apart. The social development department is building health treatment centres in provinces which they do not have such facilities, like in Northern Cape, North West, Free State, Limpopo and Eastern Cape, Zuma said.Zuma also urged law enforcement agencies to work around the clock to arrest those who sell drugs to young people.The call to build rehabilitation centres comes after local and national leaders called on the private sector to fight drug abuse in the province, especially in previously disadvantage communities.Recently, Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini urged communities to work together to fight gangsterism.Dlamini said the young people must come up with innovative ideas on how to turn the province around and fight social ills. Young people must come up with ideas on how we are going to save water as a society, creating a conducive environment for everyone to live in, Dlamini said.She spoke during the youth camp in Kimberley hosted by the department in partnership with the National Youth Development Agency.Dlamini encouraged young people of the province to stay away from drugs and alcohol to better their lives and endure a healthy lifestyle.She said parents have a huge role to play in ensuring the youth are empowered and motivated to deal with challenges.Meanwhile, the provincial government had been calling on members of the society to come forward and assist the police in cracking down on drug lords in the province. Premier Sylvia Lucas said there should be a concerted focus on the fight against alcohol and drug abuse. She said it was unforgivable for drug lords to use young people to carry out their dirty work for them and ruin lives. We need more public awareness campaigns in order to protect young people from being used in this manner, our future cannot be destroyed by a few greedy individuals who have nothing but profits from drug proceeds at heart, Lucas said.The premier also urged community members to play their part to ensure that the fight against crime is won. I wish to stress again that we cannot win the fight on crime without the active support of communities and individuals. We depend on your buy-in because the only and most effective way to fight and eradicate crime is when we have involvement of the communities we serve. TIISETSO MANOKOtiisetsom@thenewage.co.za
