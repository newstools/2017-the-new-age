Teenage striker Dominic Solanke, capped for England at the recent Under-20 World Cup, signed for Liverpool from Premier League champions Chelsea on Tuesday.The 19-year-old forward scored four goals in England&#8217;s Under 20 campaign which saw them beat Venezuela in June&#8217;s final and win their first global trophy since the senior team in 1966.&#8220;It feels amazing and everyone has made me feel welcome already,&#8221; said Solanke.&#8221;Even just pulling on the training top, I was over the moon. Hopefully I can put on the shirt in the near future and make some history here.&#8221;He could cost Liverpool around 3 million ($3.8m, 3.4m euros) according to the BBC but that will be decided by a tribunal because although his contract with Chelsea has expired, the club are due a fee for nurturing his talent and because he is under 24.Solanke, who played just once for Chelsea coming on as a substitute in a 2014 Champions League match, has senior level experience having spent the 2015/16 season out on loan in the Netherlands with Vitesse Arnhem where he scored seven times in 25 appearances.-AFP
