Research by the World Economic Forum (WEF) has found that women work nearly an hour longer than men.According to the WEF Gender Gap report women on average work for eight hours and 39 minutes a day while men lag behind, putting in seven hours and 47 minutes of work a day.According to the report which was released earlier this month, in South Africa women worked for an average seven hours and 41 minutes a day while men only clocked in slightly over 7 hours. In many societies, even as women have entered the labour force, they have also retained primary responsibility for unpaid work such as care-giving and household chores, the Gender Gap report states.According to the report &#8220;the gap between men and women s unpaid work was narrowest in Sweden and widest in Turkey, out of a set of 26 wealthy and three emerging economies&#8221;.Earlier this month StatsSA released its Labour Force Survey for the first quarter of 2017.The report (which recorded an unemployment rate of 27,7%, the highest observed since September 2003) revealed that &#8220;Black African women are more vulnerable in the labour market, with larger employment shares in low-skilled occupations&#8221;.The report showed that the proportion of black African women employed in low-skilled occupations was around 43.0% in both Q1:2016 and Q1:2017In contrast, more than half of white and Indian/Asian women were employed in the skilled occupations, compared to 18.0% of black African and 20.2% of coloured women.-TNA Reporter
