Somalia rejoined the world wide web on Monday, more than three weeks after internet access was cut when a container ship damaged an undersea cable connecting the Horn of Africa nation to the world.&#8220;The technical issue, which has disrupted the internet connection, is resolved and the service is now resumed,&#8221; telecommunications minister Abdi Anshur Hassan told a press conference in the capital Mogadishu.The blackout affected the majority of the 6.5 million people living in Somalia&#8217;s south-central region, cutting off access to everything from hotel booking sites to remittance platforms and costing $10 million (nine million euros) each day in lost business, according to a government estimate.The outage started in late June when a container ship, believed to be the Panama-flagged MSC Alice, accidentally dragged its anchor through the main fibre optic cable connecting Somalia to the internet as it was docking outside Mogadishu&#8217;s port.Despite years of conflict, Somalia is home to a thriving telecommunications sector that drives businesses and allows Somalis in the country to communicate with the estimated two million-strong diaspora population.By themselves, remittances from abroad make up $1.4 billion annually, or a quarter of the country&#8217;s GDP, according to a World Bank estimate.In the capital, young people greeted the news that the internet was back with jubilation.&#8220;You cannot imagine how happy I am today. The internet is back and I can browse to read and publish all my delayed posts on Facebook,&#8221; university student Farhiyo Adan said, likening the weeks without social media to &#8220;being in a dark room alone.&#8221;-AFP
