Violent protests in Joe Slovo Park have cost the city and ratepayers at least R2m.Residents in Phoenix, Milnerton scrambled to save their homes from burning down amid violent protests in neighbouring Joe Slovo on Monday night.The protest, which follows the removal of about 20 shacks by the city s anti-land invasion unit, led to more than 500 people going on the rampage, setting fire to a local community hall and a clinic.On Sunday night, a MyCiTi bus was torched by protesters.Residents living in Capricorn Way behind the clinic, said they battled to put out the flames themselves as the fire engine could not get to the clinic, while rioters were stoning passing vehicles.A woman, who wanted to stay anonymous, said she went to Phoenix to see her boyfriend who lives behind the clinic and when the fire broke out, residents could not get help. At the same time they burnt the community hall and the fire engine was there. We went to Milnerton police station, but they told us that the protesters were stoning them and they could not get in, she said.The woman said the residents rallied together and gathered buckets and hoses to stop the fire from spreading. We basically put it out ourselves, but we did eventually get help from principal inspector Vivian Henry who jumped in and ran down Koeberg Road to get the water truck to come to help us, she said.Residents used tap water to douse flames and were now worried about the high water bills at the end of the month.Police spokesperson Lt-Col Andr Traut said police took action to disperse the crowds and to maintain law and order. No one has been arrested. The circumstances surrounding the public violence are being investigated. Meanwhile, member of the mayoral safety and security committee JP Smith condemned the damaging of the community hall and said it was extensive.All the rooms in the centre, including the hall, kitchen and sports equipment were gutted. This is particularly hard to swallow when on Tuesday the department of recreation and parks finished extensive repairs to all ceiling boards and doors in this facility after years of motivating for the funding for these repairs. More than 2000 children a week visit the centre to take part in recreational activities, including aerobics, basketball, drama and cr che programmes.The centre also has a very popular gym.He said no room in the facility was spared in this act of violence.The main hall and kitchen have both sustained substantial fire damage.Tatenda Chiriseriprovinces@thenewage.co.za
