Lebanon seeks cooperation with Saudi Arabia, the country&#8217;s Hezbollah-backed President Michel Aoun told Saudi television on Tuesday, after a tense year in relations between the two countries.Aoun arrived in Riyadh on Monday night with a delegation of ministers.It is his first trip to the kingdom since his election in November ended a two-year deadlock between Iran- and Saudi-backed blocs in the Lebanese parliament.In an interview with Saudi state news channel Al-Ekhbaria, Aoun said his ministers of foreign affairs, education, finance and information would meet their counterparts &#8220;to find some fields of cooperation.&#8221;Aoun himself held talks over lunch on Tuesday with King Salman, but the official Saudi Press Agency gave no details of their content.Aoun, a Maronite Christian former army chief, clinched the presidency with shock support from Saudi ally Saad Hariri, a leading Sunni figure who in return was named prime minister.Analysts say Saudi Arabia is hoping for a more stable Lebanon, after concerns about the role played by Hezbollah in the Lebanese government.The Iran-backed Shiite militant group has fighters in Syria supporting forces of President Bashar al-Assad.Saudi Arabia, Iran&#8217;s regional rival, backs some rebels opposed to Assad.Riyadh last March declared Hezbollah a &#8220;terrorist organisation&#8221; and urged its citizens to leave Lebanon.In February, the kingdom halted a $3 billion programme of military aid to Lebanon to protest what it said was &#8220;the stranglehold of Hezbollah on the state&#8221;.The programme, funded by Riyadh, would have provided vehicles, helicopters, drones, cannons and other military equipment from France.It aimed to ensure stability in a Lebanon weakened by internal divisions and threatened by jihadists.Asked vaguely by Ekhbaria about the agreement, Aoun said: &#8220;Of course we will discuss all the possible issues.&#8221;Syria&#8217;s nearly six-year civil war has been a major fault line in Lebanese politics, and the country hosts more than one million Syrian refugees.Aoun told the Saudi channel that Lebanon&#8217;s partners &#8220;have agreed to build Lebanon, regardless of the results in the other countries, because building Lebanon is for all, and secondly, security and stability is for all.&#8221;He said his country&#8217;s internal political situation has improved, and expressed confidence that &#8220;balance&#8221; can be maintained.&#8220;The state must realise, and maintain, security and stability for individuals and groups even if there are different political visions regarding neighbouring and regional countries,&#8221; Aoun said.-AFP
