Barcelona&#8217;s Turkish midfielder Arda Turan will be out for around three weeks because of a &#8220;muscular injury in his right thigh&#8221;, the Catalan club said Wednesday.Medical examinations revealed a &#8220;damaged adductor muscle&#8221;, leaving the midfielder out of the squad for &#8220;approximatively three weeks&#8221;, Barca said in a statement.Turan turned out for Turkey in their 2-0 World Cup qualifying victory over Finland on Friday, but will have to sit out the friendly against Moldova on Monday.The injury means he will also miss La Liga games against Granada and Sevilla, as well as likely sitting out the April 11 Champions League quarter-final at Juventus.-AFP
