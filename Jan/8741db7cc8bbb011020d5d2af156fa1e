Top -flight Greek side Olympiacos and Ligue 1 campaigners Montpellier from France are not giving up on their quest to lure Keagan Dolly.The two clubs have reportedly made strides by upping the price for their Mamelodi Sundowns target.This development comes right on the heels of Downs owner Patrice Motsepe s extraordinary attack on overseas teams, whom he accused of disrespectful conduct when dealing with southern African teams.Dolly has courted attention in recent weeks with his team taking him to the PSL s Dispute Resolution Chamber over a mistake in his contract, stating the buyout clause.Sundowns, who won the case, insist he is worth about R24m and Olympiacos and Montpellier have tabled an improved offer of R21.7m on the table for the Bafana Bafana midfielder.Previously Montpellier offered the African champions R14m, which was deemed peanuts by Sundowns.Motsepe told the media in a press conference this week that he would not hesitate to sell the player, but only if interested suitors match the player s buyout clause.It is believed the buyout clause Motsepe is referring to is R24.8m.It remains to be seen if Sundowns will accept the new offers and let the former SA U-23 captain realise his dream of playing overseas.While the 23 year old still attracts suitors, his representatives and the SA Football Players Union are busy finalising papers to lodge an appeal against the DRC s decision which ruled in Sundowns favour.But that will hit Dolly hard on the pocket since he has to pay the legal costs.The initial fee is R23000 and if the matter goes to arbitration he will have to pay R30 000.Already the player is thought to have paid more than R200000 on legal fees on the case.Dolly s representatives have indicated they will first appeal with Safa s AppealBoard and approach Fifa in order to find justice .The transfer window closes on January 31.LINDA XIMBAnews@thenewage.co.za
