A strong demand for jewellery and watches has led to a 5% increase in sales for Swiss luxury goods group Compagnie Financiere Richemont compared to the prior year s period,the company said in a trading update yesterday.Richemont said its growth was driven by jewellery across most regions and watches in the retail channel in Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Americas. In Europe, sales increased by 3% in the third quarter, in contrast with the 17% decline registered in the first six months of the year.This improvement was primarily driven by robust local sales and tourist purchases in the US as well as strong jewellery sales across the region. The 10% growth in sales in the AsiaPacific region reflected strong performances in mainland China and Korea, mitigated by continued declines in Hong Kong and Macau.Sales in the Americas region grew by 8%, supported by jewellery and the reopening of the Cartier Mansion in New York. A decline in Japan was limited to 1% due to strong resilience of the domestic clientele and the reopening of the Cartier flagship store in Tokyo. Retail sales grew by 12%, compared to the 5% decline in the first six months of the current year, underpinned by solid jewellery sales, positive watch sales and the reopening of the two Cartier stores.In the wholesale channel, the decline in sales was limited to 3%. The other businesses posted good growth, mainly driven by Chloe, Montblanc and Peter Millar.-Thelma Ngoma|thelman@thenewage.co.za
