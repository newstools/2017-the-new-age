The most anticipated Bail verdict of the accused Nigerian televangelist Tim Omotoso has been postponed to June 9.Women representing different political parties and those who support the Pastor stood outside the Port Elizabeth New law court on Tuesday waiting the outcome.State advocate Nceba Ntelwa told the court that it is sickening to see what is happening outside the court. Just look at what is happening outside, It really pains me that there are people defending him. They don t understand why he is here. I ask the court to protect the victims by not releasing that man,&#8221; said Ntelwa.In his expensive shiny Blue suit Tim Omotoso smiled when his defence team accused Hawks investigating officer Peter Plaatjies of lying, generalising and including exaggerating facts.Omotoso&#8217;s lawyer Alfonso Hattingh told the magistrate that his client had given an undertaking that he would stand trial, not interfere with state witnesses and abide by any bail conditions set.Ntelwa argued that the evangelist knew his pending investigation since 2016 but he made it impossible for the Hawks to arrest him.&#8220;He had allegedly continued his sexual encounters with young women and this just shows you the type of man we are dealing with, said Ntelwa.Meanwhile his supporters continued giving the man of God their support outside the court , some expressed themselves on a Facebook page named &#8220;free Omotoso&#8221;.Tinashe Banhamombe one of his supporters said he is disappointed with some media houses reporting senseless stories on the alleged pastor.&#8220;The Devil is a toothless lion I was watching news on SABC how on earth can someone fly from one country to another for such years with fake papers? this is total madness on its own ,the Bible says many times a righteous person shall fall in to troubles but God will deliver him from them all,&#8221; said Banhamombe.Ntelwa said Omotoso was an illegal immigrant and should he be released, there was nothing stopping him from jumping on an aeroplane out of the country.The 58-year-old married father of two was was arrested on 21st of April and faces 22 counts of rape and sexual assault from numerous women.TNA Reporter
