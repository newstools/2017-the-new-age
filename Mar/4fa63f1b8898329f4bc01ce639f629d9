The concept of fake news , previously largely associated with Donald Trump and his political shenanigans yesterday hit South Africa like a sledgehammer.A disturbing headline loudly proclaimed that South Africa s 400m Olympic champion Wayde van Niekerk had been stripped of his Rio de Janeiro Olympic gold this week, by a website purporting to be American sports channel ESPN and on social media.However, the real ESPN site had no mention of the headline Wayde van Niekerk stripped of Gold in Rio , among its top stories. In fact, the last time ESPN posted a story on the 24-year-old world record holder was in August.The fabricated report also went on to say that Van Niekerk, who last night was headlining a Speed Series meet in Bloemfontein, had been taking a new supplement stack. Bogus! Not Wayde. Maybe somebody else, Sascoc boss Gideon Sam scoffed.TNA REPORTER
