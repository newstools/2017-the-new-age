Municipalities in the province set to work with the department of local government and human settlements in prioritising water and sanitation projects.Premier Supra Mahumapelo had on his state of provincial address said the municipalities should work together to achieve this goal. The executive committee has directed the department of local government and human settlements, working together with national Department of Water and Sanitation, to develop a provincial plan to upscale municipalities with proven capacity to apply for and be granted Water Services Authority status, Mahumapelo said.Provincial local government and human settlements spokesperson Ben Bole said the move was in line with Mahumapelo s pronouncement early this year, that the Municipal Infrastructure Grants in all municipalities in the province be utilised to prioritise water and sanitation. This enjoys support of our national Cooperative Government and Traditional Affairs Department. Consultation is ongoing between the department and the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) to assist municipalities to prioritise their water and sanitation infrastructure projects and a devise means of dealing with the financial challenges thereof, Bole said.In 2014, Premier Mahumapelo signed a memorandum of understanding on infrastructure development with DBSA.The department is also working with the national Department of Water and Sanitation to develop a provincial plan for municipalities to be granted water services authority status.A Water Service Authority, defined as any municipality responsible for ensuring access to water service in the Act, may perform the functions of a Water Service Provider, and may also form a joint venture with another water services institution to provide water services. The DBSA is a development financial institution, which provides financing, project preparation and implementation support in South Africa and the rest of the African continent with the intention of improving the quality of life of people in support of economic and regional integration, he said.Minister of Water and Sanitation Nomvula Mokonyane said.The country has been hit by the worst drought in the last 100 years and the severest for the Western Cape in the last 104 years. This drought has not only affected SA, but also the rest of the world because of global warming and climate change, the minister said. In North West, we will supply water to five mines and provide reliable supply of potable water to the municipal areas of Moses Kotane, Rustenburg and Thabazimbi local municipalities, which will benefit a combined population of about 826212 people who stand to benefit, Mokonyane said.The department of water and sanitation will implement water restrictions in major dams in North West to limit the use of water for urban and irrigation purposes.The department said it was in the process of publishing a gazette on water restrictions to limit the use of water for urban and irrigation purposes from Sehujwane, Marico-Bosveld, Kromellenboog, Swartruggens, Pella, Madikwe, Molatedi, Lindleyspoort, Setumo and Koster dams and river systems.The restrictions come as a result of the continuing drought, which has seen the dams running below normal water levels. The department plans to implement restrictions to mitigate the risk of complete system failure to supply water.CHARLOTE HLANGWANEprovinces@thenewage.co.za
