Drug abuse continues to spread pain and havoc in our daily lives. Families have been dismantled, jobs and lives have been lost, careers have been shoved down the drain, all for the next fix.We all have been affected by this monster.You either know someone who has been affected or you are the victim of this heinous activity.Many reasons have been cited as to why the country is experiencing this epidemic and these include socio-economic challenges such as unemployment, poverty, lack of proper guidance, to name only a few.According to the African Journal for Physical Health Education, in the past few years South Africa has experienced an increase in the amount and types of illicit drug manufacturing, use and distribution.This has resulted in an increase in the burden of mental health across communities. The patterns of drug use have been linked to regional variations, racial and geographical differences. Nyaope is one of the low-end heroin-based designer or cocktail drugs commonly used in predominantly black townships and has been in circulation for more than ten years. There is unfortunately a shortage of scientific studies on this addictive psychoactive substance.However, a study explores the experiences of nyaope users in three provinces of South Africa, involving a combination of in-depth interviews and focus group discussions, was used to collect data.The results showed large numbers of both male and female users, who initially enjoyed experimenting with the drug, but became addicted, regret ever starting to take the drug.The cravings for nyaope cause extreme body pain, which pushes them to increase both the amount and frequency of use.Nyaope users are characterised by deteriorating hygiene, dazed looks and are known to steal to perpetrate their habit.This is a clear indication we have a problem as a nation and one that requires a concerted effort from all. Recently we have been hit with reports of a new phenomenon called bluetooth .This is when the blood of a person who has just injected drugs is drawn and then injected by another.Bluetooth occurs when a person does not have money for a fix and starts experiencing withdrawal symptoms. It is imperative to note that one cannot get high from sharing blood.Furthermore, blood transfusion by this method carries health risks.Research by the South African Medical Research Council in 2013 indicates that injection drug use is associated with infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.Gauteng city officials therefore appeal to our youth to refrain from this life-threatening practice.NGOs such as StepUP aim to reduce HIV and similar harms in people who inject drugs by offering health services to them.StepUP runs a needle and syringe programme which provides clean needles and syringes to people who inject drugs, so that sharing of needles is minimised, but does not to address the actual bluetooth phenomenon.A published article, Continuing Education in Anaesthesia, Critical Care &amp; Pain: 2006, states that complications from blood transfusion are rare but can be life-threatening and this is attributed to the fact that blood transfusion occurs in the presence of trained medical staff.Most reported complications are because of transfusion of mismatched blood products and are avoidable through clinical vigilance.Mismatch of blood can kill by causing a rapid and catastrophic reaction in which the person s body starts destroying the red blood cells almost immediately after infusion. So one can t help but worry about the selfinflicted danger of those exchanging blood without any medical attention.This has indeed opened a new whole world for the nation and the government at large. The National Drug Master Plan 2013-17 indicates that there can never be a single effective drug policy, due to the fact that the drug problem differs within or across societies.This is an indication that drugs are indeed a social problem that the government alone cannot not curb. The government conducts awareness programmes that seek to educate on the dangers of abusing drugs and also has programmes that deal with the aftermath.Rehabilitation and aftercare programmes are extended to ex-users and those that want to kick the habit, but these seem to have a modest impact on society.Law enforcement, health and social welfare departments and other stakeholders make a significant contribution in fighting the scourge.Some community members and civil society organisations are taking a stand against drug abuse as well. One addict is one too many. We cannot stand back and see the nation swallowed by this monster. We must blow the whistle on substance abuse.BUSI KHESWABusi Kheswa; Gauteng department of social development
