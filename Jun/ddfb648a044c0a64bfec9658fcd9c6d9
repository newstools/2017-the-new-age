The North Gauteng High Court today granted President Jacob Zuma leave to appeal the ruling compelling him to provide reasons for his cabinet reshuffle.Zuma went to the court seeking an appeal against a ruling ordering him to provide records detailing reasons for his Cabinet reshuffle.Last month judge Bashir Vally ordered Zuma to supply all records and documents relating to correspondence, contracts, memoranda, advice, recommendations, evaluations and reports, that influenced his decision to reshuffle the Cabinett.In today s proceedings, Zuma s lawyer, Advocate Ismael Semenya, SC, argued that Rule 53 of the Uniform Rules of Court had not been interpreted correctly. He argued that it was possible that a different court could arrive at a different decision.However, the defence counsel for the DA, Advocate Steven Budlender, argued that Rule 53 executive decisions could be taken on review, and that leave to appeal be granted, only if there were compelling reasonsVally in his Friday ruling said based on the merit he is not of the view there would be prospects for a successful appeal in a different court however there may be other compelling reasons.pic.twitter.com/pCXhx5eN4g Siphiwe (@SK_MCHUNU) June 2, 2017-TNA Reporter
