THE Reserve Bank said it had been notified about scam emails that purport to be correspondence from the senior executives, in which recipients are informed they have payments due to them. The emails go further to say that the release of these funds is conditional on the recipient paying a certain fee. The Bank said this was clearly a scam and warned people not to be taken in. In emails in possession of The New Age, fraudsters are using fake email addresses purportedly from deputy governor Aaron Mminele, notifying the recipient of unpaid funds worth R126m at the Reserve Bank that need to be collected. The email also asks for the recipients’ cellphone numbers, age, private email addresses and occupational details. The Bank has clarified that its activities do not include making payments to nor receiving payments from the public, either locally or abroad. “Any emails or other forms of correspondence purporting to be from the Reserve Bank and informing recipients of funds due to them by the Bank must be rejected as a scam,” the Bank said. The Bank said this type of scam was more prevalent at this time of year.  -THELMA NGOMA|thelman@thenewage.co.za
