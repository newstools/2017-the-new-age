South Africa is among a raft of countries that will be more vulnerable to a ratings downgrade if president-elect Donald Trump follows through with some of his economic plans.Trump s plans to slash taxes could threaten even the US s triple-A credit rating over the medium term, the head of EMEA sovereign ratings at the Fitch agency said yesterday. We do see increasing medium-term pressures on the US rating, Ed Parker said at the agency s annual credit outlook conference in London. Even before elections the US had the highest level of the government debt of any triple-A country. If we add on top of that Trump s plans to cut taxes by $6.2 trillion (R84 trillion) over the next 10 years that could add around 33% to US government debt, he said.Emerging markets are particularly vulnerable because higher US interest rates could lure investors away from their bonds, and a stronger US dollar could make it more expensive for them to service foreign debt. Two of the key ratings decisions for Fitch this year in the developing world will be South Africa and Turkey, both of which are on the cusp of a drop into junk territory at BBB with a negative outlook.South Africa s economy is barely growing, threatening to leave millions unemployed and fuelling social unrest.With President Jacob Zuma enmeshed in corruption scandals, there are doubts over whether the country can implement the economic reforms needed to shore up growth. In terms of what could trigger a downgrade, the key issues we are looking at are, very weak growth, a rising budget deficit and how politics affects economic performance and economic policies, Parker said, adding that their next rating review on South Africa would likely be in May or June.Trump will take office on January 20 but some of his promised policy changes have sparked market and economic concern, including tax cuts, a repeal of the healthcare reform enacted under President Barack Obama and a threat to slap tariffs on firms moving jobs overseas.Parker said that in the short-term Trump did not pose a risk to the US credit rating because the country continues to benefit from strengths such as the role of the dollar as the world s predominant reserve currency Fitch has a stable outlook on its AAA rating on the US. Of the other two main agencies, Moody s also has the top rating for the No 1 world economy but Standard and Poor s has it one notch lower at AA. Reuters
