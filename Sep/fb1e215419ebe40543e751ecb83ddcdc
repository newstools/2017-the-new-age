McDonald&#8217;s workers staged the first ever strike in Britain on Monday in protest at pay and working conditions at the US fast-food giant.About 40 workers gathered outside two restaurants in Crayford, southeast London, and in Cambridge before attending a protest outside parliament.Workers are demanding an hourly wage of 10 ($13, 11 euros), union recognition and an end to zero-hours contracts, under which employees are required to be available for work but have no guaranteed minimum hours.&#8220;For far too long, workers in fast-food restaurants such as McDonald&#8217;s have had to deal with poor working conditions, drastic cuts to employee hours, and even bullying in the workplace, viewed by many as a punishment for joining a union,&#8221; Ian Hodson, president of the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union, said in Cambridge.Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour party, lent his support, saying the demands &#8220;are just and should be met&#8221;.McDonald&#8217;s highlighted that those on strike made up less than 0.01 percent of its workforce and that 86 percent of its workers had opted for flexible contracts.&#8220;McDonald&#8217;s UK and its franchisees have delivered three pay rises since April 2016, this has increased the average hourly pay rate by 15 percent,&#8221; it said in a statement.-AFP
