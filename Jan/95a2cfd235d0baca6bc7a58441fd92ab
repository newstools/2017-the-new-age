I want to be myself, play like I did at Zanaco, I am a goalscorer and goal creator; that [attribute] has helped all the teams I have played for and I think that will also help here those are qualities that can get you into any team, said Funga on the club&#8217;s website.He also said that joining the team was a positive stepping stone for greater things to follow citing the quality that is presently in the team as well as players that have played at the club, further stating that this will add to his motivation.CEO Ari Efstathiou said that he was given a mandate to bring in more attacking players for the remainder of the season. He said he looks forward to seeing the flair of the pair on the field. He also said that the club is in positive mood for the second half of the season, including the players that have recently joined the club. Aubrey was scouted at the same time as Rodrick, between them they scored 24 goals for Zanaco when they won the league last year. They both have goals in them and we are definitely bringing an attacking flair to the team which is what we have been looking for, said Efstathiou. Having a pair of Zambians at the club together makes the process a lot more comfortable for both of them. Both play in behind the strikers, Funga is more versatile; he can play left-wing, right-wing and in attacking midfield,&#8221; Efstathiou added.TNA Reporter
