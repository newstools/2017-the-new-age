Fans and followers of media darling Khanyi Mbau can breathe a sigh of relief as the singer s skin won t be falling off due to skin lightening procedures.Mbau has come out to set the record straight on a picture that went viral last Tuesday and resulted in her being labelled pink and resembling pink polony by social mediatrolls.As soon as the commotion died down the Metro FM DJ opened up during an interview with Phat Joe on East Coast radio. She explained that her complexion was not pink but it was a case of an over-filtered picture. It was a picture that was over-filtered and people assumed that was the colour of my skin. Meanwhile, Hardus Bester, founder and inspiration for Best Body Skin clinic, where Mbau does her beauty enhancement treatments and its ambassador said there was a difference between skin bleaching and skinlightening. We do not do skin bleaching, we do skin lightening and Khanyi has never done any bleaching with us. We use injections and do a follow up treatment with carefully selected skin care products, Bester said.Asked what the difference was Bester did not elaborate but directed The New Age to one of the dermatologists at the clinic. But just to add, there are no dangers to Khanyi s procedures because we follow correctprocedures. We first consult with her and go for methods that best suit her skin. he said. Nontokozo Gxumisa
