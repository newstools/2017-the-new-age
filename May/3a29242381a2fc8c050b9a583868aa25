The defence competitive international landscape requires, among other elements, that companies such as Denel maintain the highest degree of agility and with this in mind, the state-owned arms company conformed to all governance and statutory prescripts leading up to the formation of the Denel Asia joint venture.This is according to the company in reaction to what it said it had noted in recent media reports on former national Treasury director-general, Lungisa Fuzile, in court papers regarding the establishment of a joint venture company that Denel entered into as a vehicle to penetrate the Asia-Pacific markets. Denel would like to reiterate the fact that this Asia Pacific market was critical for any progressive global defence company, it said.Denel said the selection of a partner for this joint venture followed a rigorous process which started with two major defence businesses. Unfortunately both had already committed themselves to exclusive partnerships with other competing global defence businesses. VR Laser Asia s proposition was found to be the next best opportunity given the financial commitment made risk free to Denel, demonstrable defence adjacent industry network as well as direct links to defence capabilities.Zwelakhe Ntshepe, the acting group chief executive of Denel, said the financial commitment was adequately embedded into the shareholders agreement with the necessary default clauses to deal with the unlikely event when the commitment was not fulfilled. He said since its inception, Denel Asia had not traded and this was in line with instructions from the public enterprises minister and Denel board to allow the engagement process with the Treasury which is under way. Given the competitiveness of our environment, this delay and negative publicity around Denel Asia has cost us some valuable time in positioning Denel appropriately for export opportunities that would have been of huge advantage to our developmental agenda as a nation. There are, however, still a number of opportunities opening up this market which we are resolute in chasing. The East Asia market, in particular India is the fastest growing defence market in the world. This is an important region for Denel to expand its business and find new markets for our world-class products, especially in the fields of artillery, armoured vehicles, missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles, Ntshepe said.-SELLO RABOTHATA|sellor@thenewage.co.za
