Journalists in The Gambia urged the country&#8217;s new leadership on Tuesday to uphold its pledge to respect media freedom following a violent assault on a reporter by supporters of President Adama Barrow.Kebba Jeffang, a journalist for Foroyaa newspaper, described being hit, scratched and insulted at a press conference on Sunday held by ministers from three parties who joined together to form Barrow&#8217;s new coalition government.Barrow has made press freedom a pillar of his reforms since taking power earlier this year from Yahya Jammeh, whose authoritarian 22-year rule was marked by arrests and intimidation of reporters.&#8220;We condemn the attack on Kebba Jeffang and call on the leaders of the three political parties to take appropriate action to address this matter,&#8221; said Gambia Press Union Secretary General Saikou Jammeh.Describing &#8220;an attack on freedom of expression, particularly media freedom,&#8221; Jammeh added the supporters&#8217; actions were illegal and had &#8220;no place in a democratic society.&#8221;Madi Jobarteh, who writes for the popular Gambian blog platform Fatu Network, said the violence was &#8220;utterly unacceptable and totally unbecoming of the new Gambia we wish to build.&#8221;Eyewitnesses said Jeffang was attacked for asking pointed questions to the ministers about whether their parties would continue to maintain their coalition in The Gambia&#8217;s upcoming legislative elections.&#8220;The journalist&#8217;s only &#8216;offence&#8217; is to ask questions to Ousainou Darboe and Mai Ahmad Fatty, the respective leaders of United Democratic Party (UDP) and Gambia Moral Congress (GMC),&#8221; said Amadou Bojang, who saw the attack take place.Darboe is The Gambia&#8217;s foreign minister while Fatty currently serves as interior minister.Members of UDP, GMC as well as the National Reconciliation Party &#8212; all member parties of the coalition that brought Barrow to power &#8212; are alleged to have taken part in the attack.Barrow had been a member of the UDP until he resigned to stand as the coalition candidate in a December election that unseated President Jammeh from power.-AFP
