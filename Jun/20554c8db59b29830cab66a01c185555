The youth of Mawiga near Mabopane, Tshwane, have shut down the local Big Save supermarket in the area, accusing the retailer of not providing any economic opportunities to youth in the area.According to members of the youth group blocking entry into the supermarkets, no one from the local community has been employed by this company since it opened its doors.&#8220;It&#8217;s only foreigners who are employed in the store as well as being employed as security officers,&#8221; a community youth who wished to remain anonymous said.According to the youth group, they had previously sent a proposal to the store owners to highlight their plight. The youth group claimed that they had been promised that their concerns would be listened to.However, they accused the company&#8217;s management of perpetually postponing meetings with them and not making good on their promises to provide employment.ANC ward councillor Joel Sindane who was also present on the scene said he attended the meeting to see how the matter could be resolved.&#8220;We are trying to engage with the company management because someone here cannot take decisions on behalf of management,&#8221; he saidThe councillor added that he supported the action of the frustrated youth.&#8220;We need radical economic transformation because people need to be employed, so I fully support that,&#8221; Sindane said.Sindane criticised the store for allegedly only employing foreigners and not people from the community.&#8221; If business operates here it must create opportunities for the poor people in the area. They are correct in saying that what is happening here is wrong,&#8221; Sindane said.Group financial director of Big Save, Johnny Jardim, has however denied the claims made by the youth.&#8220;I was made aware of the protest at one of our stores.We are meeting with one of the organizers of the protest tomorrow afternoon. The allegations are all untrue,&#8221; he said.-Siphiwe Mchunu
