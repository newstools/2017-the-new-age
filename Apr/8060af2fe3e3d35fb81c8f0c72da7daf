Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has on Wednesday set the record straight on who cancelled the memorial service of the late stalwarts Ahmed Kathrada.Deputy President s spokesperson, Ronnie Mamoepa said in a statement that Ramaphosa postponed the memorial service but it had not been cancelled like it was reported in the media. The Presidency has noted conflicting media reports and social media commentary on the events surrounding the request for postponement of the Official Memorial Service of the late Mr Ahmed Kathrada. The event was due to take place on Saturday, April 1, 2017 in Soweto.We wish to place it on record that Deputy President Ramaphosa did not cancel the memorial service but requested a postponement, Presidency said.The Deputy President&#8217;s statement follows public bashing of President Jacob Zuma by mourners who attended Saturday s memorial service in Johannesburg City Hall.Speaker after speaker accused Zuma of being petty saying this was motivated because he was asked not to attend the funeral of Uncle Kathy as Kathrada was affectionately known. The event had been cancelled without informing the family.The accusation continued despite Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) issuing a statement clarifying the President s lack of involvement in this decision. The Presidency wishes to correct a wrong impression that has been created in the public domain that President Jacob Zuma cancelled the memorial service that he had declared for stalwart Mr. Ahmed Kathrada. This is not true the Presidency sai.dThe President had declared Kathrada s funeral a special funeral. The Ahmed Kathrada and Nelson Mandela Foundations and the South African Communist Party hosted a memorial service for Kathrada last week Saturday afternoon &#8211; after the official event was postponed.Meanwhile, Deputy President cited the reason for postponement saying it was due to inadequate preparation to afford South Africans an opportunity to honour Kathrada. On the eve of the scheduled memorial event, Deputy President Ramaphosa was of the view that inadequate preparations had been made to enable a successful official memorial service and that in view of political developments in the country, a postponement was required to afford South Africans an opportunity to honor Mr Kathrada with the requisite honor and dignity, Mamoepa said.The statement also revealed that Presidency had communicated the news of postponement to the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation.The Office of the Deputy President added that it regretted the confusion, hurt and confusion caused due to the postponement and that it will soon announce the date and details of the memorial.-Sipho Jack
