Energy company Enel has brought two new South African solar plants into commercial operation, through its renewable energy subsidiary, Enel Green Power RSA.The solar plants include 82.5MW Adams and Pulida solar PV plants located in Northern Cape and Free State provinces respectively.William Price, Enel s country manager, said the projects were completed ahead of schedule and were making a significant contribution to the country s economy.Together, Adams and Pulida will be able to generate 318GWh per year, equivalent to the annual consumption needs of around 100000 South African households, while avoiding the emission of more than 290000 tons of CO into the atmosphere each year.The two solar plants are supported by a 20-year power supply agreement with South African power utility Eskom, which Enel was awarded in 2014 following the third round of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme tender promoted by the South African government.EGP RSA owns and operates three other PV plants in South Africa, Paleisheuwel (82.5MW), which is situated in the Western Cape province, Tom Burke (66MW) in the Limpopo province and Upington (10MW) in the Northern Cape province.The company operates the 88MW Nojoli wind farm in the Eastern Cape, where it is also building the 111MW Gibson Bay wind facility.The company s renewable energies division, has made 2016 a record-breaking year after building an all-time high 2018MW of new capacity in the past 12 months.The renewables capacity that entered into service last year will allow Enel to avoid the emission of around 4.1 million tons of CO into the atmosphere each year and will be able to satisfy the annual energy needs of around 1.8 million households.THELMA NGOMAthelman@thenewage.co.za
