We will continue to monitor the situation,&#8221; said De Ruyte.De Ruyte added that they still don&#8217;t know what the cause of the protest was, as it took them by surprise.&#8220;We will be having a meeting to get to the root of what caused the protest. What is surprising is that we have been engaging with students as we have weekly meeting with the leaders and management where they discuss issues. So it is important for us to meet with the students to find out what is going on.&#8221;There will be no classes at the Pretoria campus and other campuses will continue as normal.-TNA Reporter
