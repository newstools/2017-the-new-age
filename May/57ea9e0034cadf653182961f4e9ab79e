In a very conciliatory move following last week s legislature reshuffle and running battles leading up to ANC conference, Sylvia Lucas has wished her rival Zamani Saul well and good luck.The premier and her camp did not contest any of the top five positions of the provincial leadership of the ANC as expected. They were expected to go head to head with Saul s faction during elections on Friday night.Lucas declined nomination and a chance to contest Saul for the position of chairperson. All the five provincial executive members were elected unopposed as the Lucas camp declined nomination.Lucas said their reason fro withdrawing from election was because the issues they had raised were not attended to.She said there were issues of discrepancies that took place and were never addressed by the audit that verification team sent by the national executive committee of the ANC at Luthuli house. The next step will be requesting the national executive committee to review the whole process leading to this conference. There are still a lot of things that have not been corrected and unfortunately, we are just hitting a brick wall, she said.Meanwhile, Lucas said her working relations with Saul had been up to standard since she joined the provincial elective conference. Very good luck to Zamani, the two of us have been working very well together, he has really guided me. Comrade Zamani gave a lot of guidance when I became the treasurer and we have been having a good working relationship. The fact that we contested does not make us enemies, she said.She said Saul was one of the leaders in the ANC that she respected and his credentials for themselves.Meanwhile, Lucas said it was up to the provincial executive committee to unite the ANC in the province and end the infighting.Kenny Mmoiemang and Alvin Botes all declined to contest the position of deputy chairperson and secretary respectively.Mmoiemang is the speaker in the provincial legislature while Botes is the MEC for cooperative governance, human settlements and traditional affairs.Lucas came under fire from Cosatu and the ANC both national and provincial for reshuffling the legislature on the eve of the conference.She axed Pauline Williams and Mac Jack who were serving in transport, safety and liaision as well as finance, economic development and tourism portfolios. Jack did not mince his words when he spoke about his removal from the legislature.He said the move was more about the conference than performance and it was irrational for Premier Sylvia Lucas to make a reshuffle on the eve of the conference. We must remain focused as members of the ANC, we must not allow any disruptions. We need to work very closely in ensuring that we serve the people of the Northern Cape, he said.Jack said he took the move as positive and there was no bad blood between him and the premier. I took the news very positively, she did it on her own. It was personal. He said it was important that the ANC came out of the conference united to ensure that the movement remained to be true and the only one which community members could rely on.Gail Parker is the new MEC for finance, economic development and tourism and Alexandra Beukes will take over the reins of the transport, safety and liaison portfolio.Parker, who has been the ANC chief whip in the provincial legislature, will have to deal with the budget vote in the coming month.Beukes is a former provincial chairperson of the standing committee on public accounts as well as mayor of Khai-Ma municipality.Bongiwe Mbinqo-Gigaba was moved to public works and Mxolisa Sokatsha was taken to sport, arts and culture.Meanwhile, Cosatu provincial secretary Anele Gxoyiya said the ANC needed to recall Lucas for disrespecting the ANC-led alliance by not consulting them when she reshuffled.He said the only discipline the ANC had to give Lucas was to remove her and put someone who was capable of leading the province in her place.TIISETSO MANOKOtiisetsom@thenewage.co.za
