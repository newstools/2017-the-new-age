Five Cabinet Ministers and two Deputy Ministers are at President Jacob Zuma s side at the 28th ordinary session of the African Union s Assembly of Heads of State and Government in Ethiopia.The meeting, which started at the weekend and ends today, is scheduled to elect a successor for the outgoing chair of the chairperson of the AU Commission Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma.Her term of office ended last June but was extended to January by the AU.She is expected to return to South Africa and re-enter the political arena as the ANC Women s League preferred candidate to replace her former husband as president of the ANC when elections are held in December.The AU session was also due to consider items such as economic integration, continental passport and peacekeeping missions.In Parliament this week, Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini can expect to come under fire from opposition members of Parliament when she appears with the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) on Wednesday.They will have to inform the social development portfolio committee on plans to implement a new social grants payment system that will service the millions of South Africans whose sole source of income is government grants.The briefing should have taken place last week, but was postponed.The DA accused Dlamini of going to Ethiopia on ANC Women s League business instead of being in Parliament to update the portfolio committee. This is quite frankly a slap in the face of the millions of South Africans who rely on social assistance from the state to get by and who are rightfully worried they may be without support in less than three months time, the DA said.Dlamini and Sassa CEO Thokozani Magwaza can expect to be roasted on Wednesday when the DA is expected to use the opportunity to present itself as the defenders of the interests of the poor and present the ANC as uncaring.Tomorrow sees different portfolio committees entertaining issues such as rhino poaching, the SABC s ban on covering violent protests, the sugar tax and legislation around South Africa s withdrawal from the International Criminal Court.Making South Africa a healthier and less obese nation by weaning the country of its sugar habit will be the subject of public hearings on the taxation of sugar sweetened beverages tomorrow.On the same day, one of the major state-owned entities, the Post Office, which has lost a lot of credibility because of its poor performance, will appraise the portfolio committee on telecommunications and postal services on its turnaround strategy.But the taste of sugar and its addiction is not the only sensory issue that will be on the committee circuit this week. The results of research done on, hemp, which comes from a plant which it is said has other feel-good uses, will be raised with the portfolio committee on agriculture, forestry and fisheries.SANParks will inform the environmental affairs portfolio committee on how successful it has been in curbing wildlife crime, in particular in the fight against rhino poachers.The SABC will also feature, this time in the portfolio committee on communications which will get a briefing from the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa on its monitoring of the implementation of the compliance and complaints committee s ruling on the SABC s ban of violent protests.The Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment Bill, which was the subject of a public hearing last week, will be subject to discussion by the National Assembly s standing committee on finance on Wednesday and Thursday.news@thenewage.co.za
