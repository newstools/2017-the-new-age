The US decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement has given a &#8220;global push&#8221; to the deal, as other signatories have strongly recommitted to the landmark accord, UN chief Antonio Guterres said Monday.President Donald Trump, whose country is the world&#8217;s second biggest producer of greenhouse gases after China, drew widespread criticism when he announced on June 1 that he would quit the 2015 pact.&#8220;Since the decision by the US government to abandon the Paris accords, we have been witnessing a global push and a reaffirmation by all the other governments of their commitment&#8221; on climate change, Guterres told a conference in Lisbon.&#8220;It&#8217;s obvious for the European Union, China and India,&#8221; he added.Guterres recalled that he had recently met the leaders of China and India, describing them as countries which were &#8220;crucial&#8221; for the success of the Paris accords.&#8220;Their commitment is clear,&#8221; he said.&#8220;In the United States, this push is generating at the level of cities, in some states and in the business world a very strong commitment towards the green economy,&#8221; the UN chief said.Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has become a UN special envoy for cities and climate, &#8220;is convinced that the United States will be able to reach the targets it set itself under the Paris accord,&#8221; said Guterres.The Paris agreement, struck in the French capital in December 2015, aims to keep the increase in average world temperatures to &#8220;well below&#8221; two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.-AFP
