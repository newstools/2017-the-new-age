Singapore Airlines said Thursday it had ordered 39 Boeing passenger planes worth $13.8 billion as it seeks to expand its capacity in the face of growing competition.The carrier said it had signed a letter of intent with the US manufacturer for 20 of its 777-9s and 19 of its 787-10s, with options for six more of each aircraft, bringing the total to 51 if exercised.&#8221;Today s major order for widebody aircraft enables us to continue operating a modern and fuel-efficient fleet, providing the SIA Group with additional expansion opportunities to ensure that we retain our industry-leading position,&#8221; chief executive Goh Choon Phong said in a statement.&#8220;This order is also another demonstration of our commitment to further growing the Singapore hub, as we will be able to offer even more travel options for our customers.&#8221;The 787-10s, powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines, are due to be delivered in the 2020/21 financial year, while the 777-9s, fitted with General Electric&#8217;s GE9X engines, are scheduled to arrive in 2021/22.SIA has a fleet of 182 planes across five brands which include the main airline, regional wing SilkAir, medium- to long-haul budget carrier Scoot and low-cost arm Tiger Airways, as well as its cargo business.Aviation analyst Shukor Yusof said the deal was SIA&#8217;s attempt to move into its next stage of growth.&#8220;The new Boeing 787 aircraft are likely to be given to Scoot and Tiger Airways, which will be used for shorter journeys around the region,&#8221; said Shukor of Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics.He said the 777-9s will complement the airline&#8217;s fleet of Airbus A350s, which it uses for non-stop flights to San Francisco.SIA has been facing tough competition from Middle Eastern carriers on long-haul routes and budget airlines within the region.On Tuesday it said it booked a net profit of Sg$177 million ($125 million) in the third quarter to December, down 35.6 percent year on year, and warned 2017 would be &#8220;another challenging year&#8221;.SIA pointed to &#8220;tepid global economic conditions and geopolitical concerns, alongside market headwinds such as overcapacity and aggressive pricing by competitors&#8221;.It also said &#8220;loads and yields for both the passenger and cargo businesses are projected to remain under pressure&#8221;.SIA shares closed at Sg$9.94 Thursday, up 1.43 percent from the previous day.
