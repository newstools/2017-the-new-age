The National Taxi Alliance (NTA) has assured commuters in Gauteng that taxis will tomorrow be operating as usual and transporting passengers amidst talks of a possible strike by their rival taxi association.Confirming that NTA would not be on strike, NTA spokesperson Theo Malele said: &#8220;Taxi operation throughout Gauteng will tomorrow be operational as normal.&#8221;But reports suggest that NTA&#8217;s opposition organisation, the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) in Gauteng, will tomorrow halt its operations and take part in a march to the SA Taxi headquarters in Midrand, Johannesburg.The NTA said it did not want to add to current economic woes by hampering commuters&#8217; ability to report to work.&#8220;&#8230;we are aware of the current economic climate and can therefore not jeopardise the little that is left of our current economic status,&#8221; he said.The NTA said they would hope that Santaco would not interfere with their operations.However, in a statement , Santaco warned that no taxis would be running and advised commuters to seek alternative transport.The march by Santaco is expected to deliver a memorandum to the SA Taxi, an organisation that helps with the financing, purchasing and arranging of insurance to prospective owners, to highlight the plight of drivers affected by current economic woes.&#8220;Some members of the taxi industry have been hard hit by high interest rate of 28% and blacklisting due to the payment of R15000 monthly installments over 72 months. We can&#8217;t take it anymore,&#8221; Santaco Gauteng provincial secretary, Ralph Jones said.However, NTA&#8217;s Malele slammed Santaco for their scheduled march claiming they were not the legitimate representatives of the industry.&#8220;When we spoke to the very issues with government and corporate South Africa, they never partook and now they want to act and behave as legitimate leaders of the industry when in essence they sold out long time ago,&#8221; Malele said.At the time of publishing, Santaco was no available for comment.-TNA Reporter
