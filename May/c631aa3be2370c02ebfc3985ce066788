As the cutoff date for online applications looms, some schools are already inundated by parents looking to secure a spot in either Grade 1 or 8 for the 2018 calendar year, while other schools received less than 100 applications.Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi yesterday said almost 230000 parents had applied for space with 11 schools being high in demand.This translates to 125 547 applications for Grade 1 and 104 281 for Grade 8.Benoni High School in Ekurhuleni, Pretoria High School for Girls in Tshwane and Mondeor High School in Johannesburg are among the most sought after schools in the province.These schools have recorded between 1 000 and 15 000 applications when some of them can take in at most 300 pupils in a single grade.Conversely, Lesufi said, there were 391 schools with less than 100 applications, 249 with less than 50 applications, 204 schools with less than 25 applications and 58 schools with less than 10 applications. If we have 391 schools where less than 100 parents applied, it means there s something wrong with the schools, Lesufi said. In other areas, especially in the townships, it is very difficult to place the large numbers of pupils but the 391 schools which are part of our system, are very concerning. Similar to last year, many parents in townships waited for the late application period or flooded GDE offices in January to apply for their children. We appeal to parents not to delay and try by all means to apply before June 12. We just want to urge parents that are still waiting to apply that the June 12 midnight cut-off is non-negotiable because it will allow us to start placing the pupils who have applied. The placement process is expected to start on July 24 and will be conducted on a first-come first-served basis.Lesufi said the key determinant ultimately of how many children can be placed in a school was availability. During the placement period, principals will receive the approved and signed waiting lists from district directors to process offers of placements. Schools will send offers of placement to parents from July 24 to August 10, he said.Lesufi said the department was looking at extending its online school admissions process to all grades between 1 and 11.lillians@thenewage.co.za
