The area of Vuwani in Limpopo is again facing a total shut down after residents took to the streets on Monday over the lack of services.Limpopo police are on high alert after threats emerged from the pro-Makhado Task Team stating that government is not complying with the decision taken by the President that proper services would be rolled out by the district municipality in the area. In July, members of the community embarked on a protest to the Vhembe District Municipality offices to demand services.Over 30 schools have been torched and vandalised during demarcation protests last year and at least 27 000 learners were prevented from attending school. By the 1st of August, we expect that when you go to the traffic center and the regional office in Vuwani you will get a service which is being rendered by the district,&#8221; community representative Nsovo Sambo said.Read moreState Security department knew about Vuwani protests: MahloboHistoric roots of violencePeople of #VuwaniShutDown are the real strikers Mastie_SA (@JimmyNtshebele1) September 4, 2017#VuwaniShutdown continues!
