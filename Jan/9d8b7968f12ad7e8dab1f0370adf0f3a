French DJ David Guetta will take the stage in Mumbai on Sunday, organisers said, a day after his fans were left deflated when authorities cancelled his show over logistics and security issues.The Grammy-award winning dance music producer was scheduled to perform in Mumbai on Friday as part of a four-city India tour.But police abruptly called off the concert, saying organisers had not complied with certain formalities and had not shared their security plan with officials.The Mumbai-based promoter Sunburn confirmed the cancellation as fans started gathering outside the concert venue.But hours later Sunburn and police managed to iron out their differences, paving the way for a Sunday afternoon performance in Mumbai that will be followed by another show in New Delhi that evening, the organisers said late Friday.&#8220;David Guetta will be doing two shows on Sunday in two different cities. We are complying with all the regulatory requirements as prescribed by the authorities,&#8221; they said in a statement posted on Twitter.&#8220;The existing Mumbai tickets will be valid for the show on Sunday.&#8221;Guetta, best known for hits like &#8220;Titanium&#8221; and &#8220;When Love Takes Over&#8221;, has a sizeable following in India with thousands expected to attend Sunday&#8217;s concerts.The 49-year-old musician was supposed to kick-off his India tour in the IT hub of Bangalore on Thursday but authorities cancelled the gig, saying it clashed with a local election and that security would be a problem.&#8220;(Bangalore) cancellation has been completely out of my control and I just feel very sorry for all the fans that were looking forward to attend,&#8221; Guetta had said in a statement posted online.-AFP
