French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault began a four-day visit to India with a meeting Sunday with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bolster the &#8220;strategic partnership&#8221; between the two countries.Ayrault held talks for 45 minutes with the Hindu nationalist leader in the southern hi-tech hub of Bangalore, where he will stay until Monday evening.&#8220;The number one objective (of this trip) is to stress the strategic partnership and move it into a higher gear,&#8221; the minister told AFP afterwards.The visit is part of a series of meetings between Indian and French leaders. President Francois Hollande has visited India twice during his five-year term, in 2013 and 2016. Modi, who took office in 2014, has twice visited France.Ayrault and Modi discussed in particular collaboration in the defence sector, a few months after the sale of 36 French Rafale fighters to India for about eight billion euros ($8.4 billion).Asked about the possibility of future arms deals with India, which has become the world&#8217;s largest weapons importer as it tries to modernise its arsenal, the minister said Modi was &#8220;ready to examine everything&#8221;.India &#8220;is a huge country, which has a very important need to ensure its security against all the challenges it faces&#8221;, said Ayrault.The minister will on Tuesday visit the western state of Gujarat, where Modi was chief minister for over a decade, accompanied by a delegation of about 100 representatives of French companies.Annual trade between France and India is worth some eight billion euros, a figure that has grown markedly since 2000.-AFP
