Police said the minivan driver lost control and ploughed through a central reservation into oncoming traffic in the eastern province of Chonburi. Both vehicles burst into flames.&#8220;Twenty-five people were killed in the road accident,&#8221; Police Lieutenant Colonel Wiroj Jamjamras at Ban Bueng provincial police station told AFP, adding two toddlers were among the dead.&#8220;The victims were killed by fire or the impact,&#8221; he added.Wiroj said 15 people were inside the minivan while 12 passengers were packed into the pickup truck.Two were injured but are expected to survive, he added.Footage broadcast on Channel 3 showed firefighters tackling the burning, twisted wreckage of the two vehicles.Despite relatively good infrastructure, Thailand has the world&#8217;s second most dangerous roads in terms of per capita deaths, according to data collected by the World Health Organization in a 2015 report.Fatalities tend to rise in the New Year week and during Songkran, a religious festival in April, when millions of low-paid workers return to the countryside from their city jobs to see family.Both weeks are dubbed the &#8220;Seven Deadly Days&#8221; in Thai media, with the government keeping a daily death tally during those two periods to try to encourage better road safety.As of Sunday &#8212; the fourth day of the country&#8217;s New Year holiday week &#8212; 280 people had died on Thailand&#8217;s roads, a 10 percent increase on last year.Some 43 percent of the recorded smashes involved drink-driving and 82 percent involved motorbikes.-AFP
