There has been expectation of a somewhat moderate economic growth recovery in 2017.Nothing too impressive, but mildly stronger economic growth compared to the very weak 0.3% in 2016. This expectation has been based upon news of the alleviation of drought conditions, which should boost agriculture production, along with recently improved metals commodity prices, which should provide mild support for mining output.And indeed, in Q1 2017 economic growth numbers, it was agriculture and mining GVA (gross value added) growth that rebounded quite sharply to register 10.3% and 6.9% year on year growth rates respectively.However, outside of these sectors the situation was bleak, with four sectoral GVA s showing negative year on year rates of change, and four showing positive but slowed rates of growth.And using a quarter on quarter rate of change measurement, the first quarter of 2017 represented the second consecutive quarter of contraction, which implied a much publicised technical recession.The weak growth rates outside of agriculture and mining can, however, merely be due to normal lags, with especially mining often being a leading sector in the business cycle. However, after surges in the two SA Composite Leading Business Cycle Indicators, there have been some slight renewed declines in recent months, the SARB version s reading declining slightly in April, while the OECD version has declined mildly for four consecutive months from January to April.While it was actually global factors, including some weakening in commodity prices relevant to South African export sectors, that were largely responsible for a slight decline in the April SARB Leading Indicator, the concern going into the second quarter has been more that negative news domestically will begin to impact on business and consumer confidence, thereby stifling any possible economic growth recovery.The key negative news has been the widely publicised downgrades of certain of South Africa s credit ratings to junk status , while more recently, the news of the quarter on quarter GDP technical recession has added to the national misery .And so, perhaps unsurprisingly, the freshly-released RMB-BER Business Confidence Index for the second quarter of 2017 showed a decline to a reading of 29 (on a scale of 0 to 100), the weakest reading since the final quarter of 2009. So what hints does the residential market give about the economy in the near term?Our key question here is what does the residential property sector show, with certain of our residential indicators also being leading ones in the business cycle.Unfortunately, the second quarter FNB Estate Agent Survey provides a further hint that economic recovery is at risk of stalling fairly quickly should some fresh news not arise to bolster the national sentiment.The sample of agents questioned is asked to rate activity levels in their areas on a scale of 1 (weak) to 10 (strong). In the two summer quarters of 2016-17, this indicator began to show a rise, after a prior decline since early 2014.From a multi-year low of 5.59 (5.69 on a seasonally-adjusted basis) in the third quarter of 2016, it rose to 6.31 by the first quarter of 2017 (5.99 on a seasonally adjusted basis).However, in the Q2 2017 survey, it fell back (both non-seasonally and seasonally adjusted) to 5.69 (5.80 seasonally adjusted). This renewed q/q decline meant that, y/y, the indicator remained in negative rate of change territory too, to the tune of -1.39%.Admittedly, this year on year rate of decline has steadily diminished since mid-2016, as the smoothed trendline shows.This diminishing rate of decline in the smoothed rate of change has closely been tracked by the rate of change in the OECD Leading Indicator, whose rate of year on year decline has also diminished.The 2 growth rates correlate very well, normally the residential activity rating leading the OECD Leading Indicator by a small time margin.However, should both the OECD recent month-on-month rates of change, and the Residential Activity Rating s quarter on quarter rate of change, remain in decline, this can mean that the two indicators year on year rates of change battle to return to positive growth, and the Leading Indicator is usually a useful indicator of near term economic growth.But more of a concern than 1 quarter s Activity Rating decline is that, delving a little deeper into the survey shows agents seemingly reflecting what the FNB-BER Business Confidence Index says about the broader sentiment levels.We ask agents for their near term expectations of residential activity. This answer is of limited use due to seasonal factors in the sector.However, as a follow up we ask them to cite reasons.Insightful is the fact that 51.3 of Q2 respondents cited economic stress/pessimism as a perceived factor.This percentage has been sharply rising in the past three quarterly surveys. By comparison, those that site Positive Consumer Sentiment as a factor are now a far lesser 6.7% of survey respondents.For new mortgage lending, this can all have implications with a considerable lag.Residential activity starts to change when households begin to plan the home buying decision, viewing homes first for a considerable length of time in many cases before starting the home purchasing process.Therefore, trend changes in growth in value of Household Mortgage Loans Granted (NCR Data) can often lag trend changes in the Activity Rating by as much to four quarters.This should mean that in the near term, given the diminishing rate of decline in the Activity Rating, and 2 quarters of positive quarter on quarter growth up to the first quarter of 2017 (before the second quarter decline), New Mortgage Loans Granted could return to mildly positive growth territory in the near term after recent quarters of decline.However, whether this positive growth will be sustained for any length of time depends on the second quarter 2017 Activity Rating decline ultimately proving to be nothing more than a temporary occurrence.In short, given the generally good correlation between the FNB Residential Activity Rating and the Leading Business Cycle Indicators for South Africa, a seasonally-adjusted quarter on quarter decline in this activity rating raises questions as to whether a potential economic recovery will be sustained.Of the estate agents surveyed, there has been a major increase in the percentage of them experiencing economic stress/general pessimism in the market, which ties in with a second quarter drop in the RMB-BER Business Confidence Index for the country as a whole.It also ties in with a raft of highly publicised negative news in recent months, notably the ratings downgrades to socalled junk status , along with more recently the news of a technical recession.Agents appear to be perceiving the dampening of sentiment in the residential market as a result of such factors.John LoosJohn Loos is the household and property sector strategist at FNB
