Arts and culture MEC, Bongi Sithole-Moloi in the province, has joined other political leaders in the country to pay homage to jazz musician Thandi Klassen, who died on Sunday after a long battle with pancreatic cancer.Conveying her condolences to the family of the late diva, the MEC said Klaasen was not only a brilliant musician but also an artist with a social and political consciousness. During the dark days of apartheid Thandi composed songs that exposed the brutality of the regime, in the process becoming the target of the apartheid machinery with police constantly harassing her without success, Sithole-Moloi said.Born in Sophiatown in 1931 to a shoemaker father and a domestic worker mother, Klaasen, 86, beat the odds and went on to have a successful music career despite a disfigured face as the result of an acid attack.In a career spanning 50 years, Klaasen performed with US stars such as Roberta Flack and Patti LaBelle. She became the voice of the voiceless and a symbol of hope for millions of South Africans who longed for freedom and democracy. The lyrics of her songs reflected the untold sufferings of ordinary people while at the same time creating hope for a better future. The MEC described Klaasen as a colossus of the music industry. She helped South Africans appreciate their identity and instilled a sense of belonging in a country where indigenous people were made to feel as visitors through apartheid legislation. Klaasen, who will be buried this weekend, performed with SA s great female musicians such as Dolly Rathebe, Miriam Makeba, Dorothy Masuku and Sophie Mgcina.provinces@thenewage.co.zaCLIVE NDOU
