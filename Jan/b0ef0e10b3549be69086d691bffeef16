Amid a bloody weekend on Gauteng s roads, in which at least 20 were killed, motorists are continuing to drive at excessive speeds which are among the main causes of accidents.Gauteng traffic police went on a highspeed operation on the province s freeways at the weekend with zero tolerance maintained. Among those apprehended was a 33-year-old man from Bethal travelling at a speed of 215km/h in his M6 BMW on the N4 freeway outside Bronkhorstspruit. He was caught by the police. At some stages, the officers themselves were travelling at 239km/h following the vehicle in rainy conditions, Gauteng traffic s Busaphi Nxhumalo said. He claimed that he was afraid to be hijacked and accelerated to the speed he was caught at. The video recording made with the onboard digital eyewitness camera proved otherwise. He was arrested on the spot and taken to the Bronkhorstspruit police station where formal charges of reckless and negligent driving were opened against him with an alternative charge of exceeding the general speed limit of 120km/h.The man was released on R1000 bail and will be appearing in the Bronkhorstspruit Magistrate s Court tomorrow. In total, the unit arrested nine speedsters on Gauteng s freeways who exceeded the speed limit by more than 40km/h. This unit made a commitment that they will maintain the zero tolerance approach on Gauteng s freeways for the remainder of 2017 to make Gauteng roads safer for everybody to travel on and will show no mercy to any speedsters, she said.This comes amid a spate of serious accidents in various parts of the province, with the worst occurring on Saturday afternoon on the N1 between Murrayhill and Hammanskraal where 16 people including six children under 10 were killed.According to Netcare, two more people died from extensive injuries when an SUV rear-ended a bakkie with commuters on Sunday night on the same road just before the Hammanskraal offramp.
