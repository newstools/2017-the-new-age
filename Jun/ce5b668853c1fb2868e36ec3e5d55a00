Twitter has made major changes to its interface on twitter.com, iOS, Android, TweetDeck and Twitter Lite. The updates have been rolled out across Twitter s various platforms. Twitter said it took on board user comments and feedback in a bid to refresh its interface with aesthetic and ergonomic changes to help make the social network easier to use. Today, with lots of feedback and ideas from you, we re refreshing our product too and making it feel lighter, faster and easier to use. We listened closely and kept what you love. And for the things you didn t, we took a new approach to fix and make it better, the social network said.Tabs are being streamlined into a side menu. After being tested on Android last year, the new navigation menu for access to profile, accounts, settings and privacy will roll out to iOS. Still for iOS, links will no longer automatically open in the Twitter reader.-INDIE BOYCE|indiphileb@thenewage.co.za
