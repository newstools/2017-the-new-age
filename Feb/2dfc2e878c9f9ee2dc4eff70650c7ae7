In the jungle of Limpopo, the predatory hunters have become the hunted.Here up north, lions, known for their predatory instincts, are under siege following the recent spate of killings that have become widespread in several game farms much to the dismay of tourism authorities.In most cases, the big felines were found killed, possibly through poisoning.At Turffontein Farm south of Polokwane, police confirmed that two of the lions, both males, were found with their heads and paws hacked off. The third one, a lioness, was not dismembered, though. The incident is similar to the cases that were previously reported in Tzaneen, Mara, and Hoedspruit.In Phalaborwa, five suspects were arrested during an intelligence driven operation for illegal hunting of specially protected wild animals, lions.The arrests came after information was received that there were people selling a lion s head.A trap was set and five suspects, including a Mozambican national, were found in possession of a lion s head and were arrested forthwith.They were denied bail when they appeared in court.Meanwhile, police are still looking for illegal hunters in connection with the killing of a lion at Ingogo Safaris game lodge near the small town of Alldays.The suspects apparently threw poi soned chicken meat into the enclosure.All three lions that were in the cage ate the meat.The other two lions were only incapacitated due to the effect of the poison but the white one unfortunately died.The illegal hunters then cut off the paws, head and attempted to remove the skin.The suspects appear to have been disturbed as they failed to remove the skin.A veterinarian was called to the scene to treat the surviving animals which could not walk and the other one was even vomiting.One man was later arrested, leading to the recovery of the lion s head and all four paws. In one of the recent incidents, three lions in Tzaneen were slain.A manhunt was launched for the perpetrators who killed three male lions and cut off their legs and heads.According to provincial police spokesperson Lt Col Moatshe Ngoepe, the illegal hunters cut through a fence and entered a lion enclosure at the Letaba River Lodge, killed the three felines and cut off their heads and paws.The lions were part of the Tzaneen Lion and Predator Park, which is on the grounds of the lodge. The total value of the lions was around R900000.No arrest has been made yet.It is understood that the poachers bypassed a newly-installed, state-of-the-art security system and killed the lions by feeding them poisoned meat.Police have since appealed to game farm owners to beef up their security.It is believed that this recent upsurge in animal killings is directly related to the traditional healer market and that the cause can be directly traced to people believing the inyangas claims that these animal body parts will clear up many curses, including HIV and political problems.Spokesperson for the provincial department of economic development, environment and tourism, B Napo says: It is very bad and worrying. We are perplexed by the sudden onslaught on our most prized wild animals. We appeal to our people to act quickly when confronted with any information that may link to such actions. This affects tourism negatively because people travel from all over just see these beautiful animals, what will happen if these are wiped out? We will most certainly lose our number one spot on local tourism in the country. Moyahabo Mabebaprovinces@thenewage.co.za
