Road accidents remain the number one cause of deaths among young people aged 15 to 29, a report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) reveals.The report, Managing Speed, says young male drivers who drive under the influence of alcohol are more likely to be involved in speed-related crashes.Figures contained in the report say excessive or inappropriate speed contributed to one in three road traffic deaths.The report comes ahead of the Fourth UN Global Road Safety Week, which starts today. Speed is at the core of the global road traffic injury problem. If countries were to address just this key risk, they would soon reap the rewards of safer roads, both in terms of lives saved and increases in walking and cycling, with profound and lasting effects on health, WHO director-general Dr Margaret Chan said.Figures say around 1.25 million people die every year, worldwide, on the roads.The WHO says around 90% of the global road deaths occur in lower and middle income countries.The report says road crash fatalities are nearly three times lower in Europe than compared to Africa.South Africa is among some of the countries with a high rate of road fatalities due to crashes.The festive season and the Easter weekend are known to be the deadliest time on the country s roads with hundreds losing their lives on various roads.About 1700 people died on the country s roads during the festive season while 235 died during the Easter weekend.Human behaviour, which includes speed, drunk driving and reckless and negligent driving have all been blamed for the country s road carnage.The report comes when the department of transport is expected to implement the new changes in legislation, sometime this year, aimed at curbing road crashes.Drivers will have to be re-evaluated when renewing their licences, speed limits are to be adjusted from 60 in urban areas to 40 and no children are to be transported in the back of a bakkie among other places.The report calls for countries to implement speed management measures such as roundabouts and speed bumps, set speed limits on various roads and raise awareness about the dangers of speed among others to reduce road crashes.-LERATO DIALE&nbsp;
