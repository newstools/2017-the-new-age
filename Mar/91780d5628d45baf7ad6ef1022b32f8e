Minister of Transport Dipuo Peters has on Wednesday dissolved Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) board.The news comes right at the time the board was addressing parliamentary committee on State owned Enterprises on the status of the rail agency. William Steenkamp a board member told Parliamentary committee that there was no agreement between Prasa and transport ministry on secondment of Collen Letsoalo.&nbsp; The committee is right to say they are errors in how he was brought in. There&#8217;s no agreement between Prasa and department of transport regarding the secondment of Mr Letsoalo as acting GCEO, Steenkamp added.He further told the committee that upon Letsoalo s arrival he behaved like he was an administrator of PRASA, and that they then asked the board chairperson Popo Molefe to ask Dipuo Peters if that was the mandate. We ve been trying to get a meeting with the Minister to try find answers. Because the relationship with Mr Letsoalo was hard, Steenkamp said.Letsoalo was removed from his position as acting GCEO amid allegations that he hiked his salary by 350%.However Letsoalo provided evidence that included his letter of appointment that he said backed his claims of being a victim of an ugly media campaign.Steenkamp said the board took a decision to fire Letsoalo on 24 February.On the issue of whether they had recovered the money owed to them, he said the matter was not cut and dry. The search for the Group Chief Executive Officer continues.Meanwhile, Prasa board chairperson Popo Molefe told ANN7 that the board was expecting the minister to read the report not take such a drastic action, adding that there was no rational engagement from the minister.&#8220;Board sacking is an attempt to protect Letsoalo. This is a possible abuse of executive power by the minister,&#8221; Molefe said.He further said the board will challenge the minister&#8217;s actions.&nbsp;-Sipho Jack
