As much as it is hard to resist overtures from PSL s big spenders, SuperSport United are not prepared to entertain any interest for striker Jeremy Brockie.The New Zealander is reportedly on the radar of nouveau-riche Mamelodi Sundowns as well as the moneyed Kaizer Chiefs, the two sides looking to test United s resolve on keeping hold of their prime striker. But United boss Stan Matthews has made it clear Brockie is going nowhere and was going to remain with Matsatsantsa a Pitori at least for next season. There is a lot of interest in Jeremy, but he is going nowhere, Matthews said. We ve sat down with Eric and asked him what he thought of the squad and which players he want to build around. And he has indicated Jeremy is one of those players. And we are not going to sell him short, regardless of the interest. Unlike most clubs in the PSL, United have often matched the big clubs for big signings over the years. With 38 goals to his name since he arrived at United two seasons ago, Brockie is one of the most consistent foreign national strikers in the PSL, averaging a goal every two matches.He has been crucial for United in the Nedbank Cup, scoring two goals en route to the final, and he could be key in the decider against Pirates in Durban this weekend. He hit a bit of a slump towards the end of last season, but was hailed a saviour after his extratime goal in the Nedbank quarterfinal win against Kaizer Chiefs. Everything has a price but this is more than money for us, Matthews said. But no, we are not going to be selling him. I think Naturena (Kaizer Chiefs) and Chloorkop (Sundowns) will both have a bit of disappointment. Maybe we can speak next season. Brockie admitted he was flattered by the interest from Sundowns but that was before outgoing coach Stuart Baxter confirmed he was leaving United. It remains to be seen whether his stance would change with Baxter now gone.-KGOMOTSO SETHUSHA|kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
