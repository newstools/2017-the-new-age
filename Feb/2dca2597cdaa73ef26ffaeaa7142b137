An Egyptian believed to be the world&#8217;s heaviest woman will fly to India for weight reduction surgery Saturday after intervention from the country&#8217;s foreign minister ensured her a visa.Eman Ahmed Abd El Aty, aged 36 and weighing around 500 kilogrammes (1,100 pounds), is slated to arrive in India&#8217;s financial capital Mumbai in the early hours of Saturday, Muffazal Lakdawala, her doctor, said in a statement.She will be flown on a specially modified Airbus and will be taken to Mumbai&#8217;s Saifee Hospital upon arrival, the statement said.&#8220;To prepare her (Eman) for the flight, a team of doctors has been in Egypt for the last ten days to optimise the conditions for her travel,&#8221; the statement said.Abd El Aty&#8217;s sister had approached Lakdawala in October saying her sibling needed urgent medical attention.Her family told the doctor that as a child she was diagnosed with elephantiasis, a condition that causes the limbs and other body parts to swell, leaving her almost immobile.She later suffered a stroke and was rendered bedridden, triggering a series of ailments including diabetes, high blood pressure, hypertension and sleep apnoea.After hearing about her case Lakdawala had offered to carry out the procedure free of charge.Her request for a visa was initially rejected, prompting Lakdawala in December to tweet a request for help to India&#8217;s foreign minister Sushma Swaraj.At the time Swaraj was in hospital awaiting a kidney transplant but was quick to respond with an offer of help.Abd El Aty has had a long wait as no airliners were previously willing to fly her from Egypt to India owing to her health complications.&#8220;&#8230;Transporting Eman to Mumbai is a challenging task keeping in mind the complexities of her case as she is a high risk patient who has not been able to move or leave the house for the past 25 years,&#8221; the surgeon said.If Abd El Aty&#8217;s weight claims are proven medically, she will beat Pauline Potter (643 pounds) from the United States to become the world&#8217;s heaviest woman alive.Bariatric surgery is essentially a stomach-shrinking bypass procedure carried out on those wanting to lose excessive weight.It is increasingly common in India, which has a growing problem with obesity, particularly in urban areas.India is a key destination for medical tourists because it offers quality services at a fraction of the cost of western countries and no waiting lists.-AFP
