THE ANC s national executive committee (NEC) has been told to back off from the ongoing battle between the provincial executive committee and rebel branches.The provincial ANC Youth League (ANCYL) yesterday also told the secretary-general, Gwede Mantashe, that he could not instruct the provincial executive committee (PEC) not to appeal Tuesday s Pietermaritzburg High Court ruling declaring the provincial ANC s November 2015 elective conference unlawful.The ANCYL chairperson, Kwazi Mshengu, had a blunt message for Mantashe: This is our battle. The league s secretary-general Thanduxolo Sabelo said: We don t need the NEC s permission to appeal the decision. The provincial youth, women s and veterans leagues and the leaderships of eight regions, have instructed the provincial ANC to appeal the ruling with or without the NEC s official nod. They did not join us when the court case started and they should leave everything to us as this is our fight, not theirs, Mshengu said.Spokesperson for the ANC s PEC, Mdumiseni Ntuli, said the PEC would be meeting with the NEC to discuss the court ruling and its implications.ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa chided the leagues for their statements saying that Luthuli House would not respond to their unfortunate and ill-advised statement but instead meet with the provincial leadership to discuss the ruling. The ANC will be meeting with the provincial leadership soon to discuss the political ramifications of the court s verdict. The ANC will work with the ANC s PEC to find a workable solution, he said.SIHLE MAVUSO
