One of the highlights of this year s Armed Forces Day in Durban later this month is that locals will get to learn about the sinking of the SS Mendi, a South African troopship that was to take part in World War 1.According to South African History online, the sinking of the SS Mendi on February 21, 1917 became South Africa s worst tragedy of the First World War (1914-1918).A total of 616 South Africans, including 607 black troops serving in the South African native labour contingent, died when the steamship sank in the English Channel on the way to France.The incident happened in the early hours when another ship, the SS Darro (100000 tons) travelling at full speed and emitting no warning signals, rammed the SS Mendi.The South African army ship had sailed from Cape Town on January 16, 1917 en route to La Havre in France, carrying the Fifth Battalion of the South African Native Labour Contingent. On board were 805 black privates, 22 white officers and a crew of 33.Speaking ahead of the commemoration Siphiwe Dlamini spokesperson for the South African National Defence Force said the centenary of the sinking of the SS Mendi will be held on February 21 at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in eThekwini and the English Channel in England. During the Armed Forces Day parade and the centenary commemoration of the sinking of the SS Mendi, President Jacob Zuma will lay a wreath in honour of the fallen heroes who perished in the tragedy. Among the black Africans lost were some prominent men such as the Pondoland chiefs Henry Bokleni, Dokoda Richard Ndamase, Mxonywa Bangani, Mongameli and the reverend Isaac Wauchope Dyobha. Like so many other military disasters, the story of the SS Mendi is a story of supreme courage in the face of death and valour shown between brothers toward each other in dire circumstances. The courage displayed by these men has remained a legend in South African military history, Dlamini said.The wreath-laying ceremony will be followed by a medal parade where the commander-in-chief, President Jacob Zuma, will bestow various military medals to deserving SANDF members including the awarding of a 40 year service medal to the chief of the SANDF, Gen Solly Shoke. Various other activities have been planned as part of the celebrations. A convoy of the various types of military vehicles and support elements will arrive in Durban in preparation for the main events and other supporting activities, Dlamini said.SIHLE MAVUSO
