Two people were killed and one sustained injuries when a light motor vehicle crashed into a concrete pillar on the N4 Highway before the Mooinooi turn off outside Rustenburg on  Wednesday night. On arrival, paramedics found that the light motor vehicle had split into two pieces and was found on the side of the road. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said: “Two bodies, that of a woman and a baby girl, were found lying approximately 30 metres away from the light motor vehicle. A third patient, a man, was found walking around on the scene”. Sadly, there was nothing the paramedics could do for the woman and child as they had sustained numerous, fatal injuries. “The man was treated for his injuries and was thereafter transported to Brits Provincial Hospital for further treatment,” Meiring said. The cause of the collision is being investigated by local authorities. -TNA Reporter
