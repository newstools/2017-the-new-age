What Apple leaks have told us is that the technology giant has redesigned the new iPhone and is planning its most extensive iPhone line-up to date. Dubbed iPhone 8, Apple is testing a new type of screen, curved glass and stainless steel materials with more advanced cameras.According to Bloomberg Technology, for the finest model, Apple is testing a screen that covers almost the entire front of the device. We understand that Apple has also experimented with integrating the iPhone s fingerprint scanner into the screen of the OLED version. The illustration as tweeted by Sonny Dickson, features what appears to be a space at the back below the Apple logo for a potential fingerprint scanner.Dickson has a reputation as a reliable source of phone leaks, quoted widely by news sources. One of the features expected in the upcoming iPhone 8 is a fingerprint sensor placed under the phone s glass exterior. That sensor is expected to go under the phone s cover glass to let Apple remove the iPhone s home button and create a larger display. Dual vertical cameras are here, touch ID sensor on the back. Definitely a shift in design, Dickson tweeted. It is rumoured that although the screen size of the iPhone X could be 5.8-inches, the actual workable area might be much less. The wraparound display is said to be limited to the iPhone X only. It is expected to use a fixed flex screen, something users in recent Samsung Galaxy smartphones. Lastly, it has been suggested that the iPhone 8 or the iPhone X could sport a stainless steel casing and a durable metal that will hold glass panels at front and back.Previous reports say that all three models will get an IP68 rating, which would make them dust and water resistant. The Samsung Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 Edge smartphones already come with this rating. The new iPhone is expected on the device s 10th anniversary. Apple s new iPhone is expected to be revealed in September.-Indie Boyce|indiphileb@thenewage.co.za
