Germany-based Bosch, the world&#8217;s largest car components supplier, on Thursday warned against nationalism even as it presented an optimistic forecast for the full year.&#8220;Our environment is not only transforming in terms of technology and business, but also more than ever with regard to politics, I would even say populism,&#8221; said chief executive Volkmar Denner.&#8221;We want a world and above all a Europe without nationalism,&#8221; the CEO continued in a speech at a research centre in Renningen, near Stuttgart in southwestern Germany.German business leaders have watched with anxiety as France&#8217;s anti-EU, anti-euro presidential contender Marine Le Pen has come closer to the Elysee palace than ever before, becoming one of two candidates in a run-off vote slated for Sunday.Le Pen&#8217;s headline policies include calls to close France&#8217;s borders and return to the former national currency, the franc. &#8220;Globalisation is useful to our business, while returning to borders would harm it,&#8221; Denner went on, echoing the arguments of Le Pen&#8217;s pro-business opponent Emmanuel Macron in a television debate Wednesday night.Bosch, which employs some 390,000 people from 150 countries, aims to boost revenue between 3.0 and 5.0 percent year-on-year in 2017 after achieving a 3.6-percent expansion last year.It reported a 12 percent increase in revenue in the first three months of this year compared with 2016&#8217;s first quarter.The privately-owned firm releases less detailed results than companies listed on the stock market.-AFP
