A number of families from the Jeffsville informal settlement in Atteridgeville were yesterday moved to another temporary site following violence that broke out when they moved there a few weeks back.The families were initially relocated to Bremmer Street by the city following a sinkhole incident. While they were erecting their shacks at the new site, violence broke out when residents of the nearby suburb of Booysen began attacking them. A number of people sustained serious injuries during the violent clashes and at least one of them later died. Housing MMC Mandla Nkomo condemned the violence that broke out during the initial relocation. The department is committed to finding a more suitable, habitable and permanent accommodation for the destitute Jeffsville families whose homes had been affected by the sinkhole, Nkomo said. As a caring municipality we will ensure that our people get the services they deserve such as water, electricity and ablution facilities. Nkomo said a geotechnical assessment of the impact of the sinkhole was done in Jeffsville and the total number of families affected had been determined. The number is sitting on 115 families .-Kutullo Madisha|kutullom@thenewage.co.za
