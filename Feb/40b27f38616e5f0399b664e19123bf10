The Chinese owner of the Aston Villa football club will buy a $100 million majority stake in the US film production company behind the &#8220;Expendables&#8221; series, the two companies announced, despite Beijing tightening controls on overseas investment in cultural sectors.Recon Holdings, owned by 40-year-old Tony Xia, will purchase a 51 percent stake in Millennium Films, the firms said in separate statements Thursday.Recon will also acquire rights to 300 of the American company&#8217;s titles. Millennium Films will keep its original management team.The deal comes as China has increased its scrutiny of overseas investment, especially in real estate, movie theatres, and sports clubs, to curb capital outflow as the falling yuan has cause the country&#8217;s foreign exchange reserves to fall.The Asian giant&#8217;s foreign exchange stockpile &#8212; still the largest in the world &#8212; dropped below the psychologically important threshold of three trillion dollars in January for the first in six years.Wanda Group, China&#8217;s most prominent buyer in the overseas movie industry, hit a wall in a $1 billion bid for Golden Globes award operator Dick Clark Productions, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday, allegedly due to Beijing&#8217;s new restrictions on overseas acquisitions.Headed by one of China&#8217;s richest men Wang Jianlin, commercial property developer Wanda has diversified rapidly in recent years into entertainment and sports, partly as a buffer against Chinese real-estate volatility.It previously purchased AMC Entertainment Holdings for $2.6 billion in 2012, and last year acquired Legendary Entertainment for $3.5 billion. The Dick Clark Productions deal would have marked its entry into television production.Millennium s chief executive Avi Lerner and chief operating officer Trevor Short described Xia, whose Chinese name is Xia Jiantong, as well-connected and said they &#8220;see enormous value in placing the Chinese market at the forefront of our global strategy , the statements said.The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of this year.Xia and his Recon Group were largely unknown to outside world before buying second-tier English club Aston Villa for a reported $87 million in May last year.Lotus Health Group, a branch of Recon that makes food seasoning, appointed Xi Yinping, who is reportedly a cousin to Chinese president Xi Jinping, as an independent board member in December 2015.Though there was never confirmation of Xi Yinping&#8217;s identity, the move sent the company&#8217;s stocks surging. But the firm cancelled the nomination a day later, without explanation.-AFP&nbsp;
