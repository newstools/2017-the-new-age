Black employment equity is an investment imperative and that the failure of business to appreciate its urgency will result in greater frustration and a negative perception of business SA s commitment to undoing the wrongs of the past.Black economic empowerment (BEE) and its later, adapted incarnation, broad-based economic empowerment (B-BEE), has largely been made a mockery of by established businesses thumbing its collective noses at the government and society as a whole.Earlier this month, Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant launched the Commission for Employment Equity s annual report which showed that top posts are still held by white men.She was reported to have said: We challenge those who believe that the employment equity and affirmative action policies have gone past their sell-by date to read this commission s report carefully and check if, in all honesty it is really the time to scrap employment equity and affirmative action. Do they truly believe that we have achieved what the Employment Equity Act was set out to do? Nefarious activities by companies who continue to window-dress at the expense of socio-economic progress will be tackled headon, no matter how long it takes.Last year acting B-BBEE commissioner Zodwa Ntuli was quoted as saying that there are too many companies that are using black employees by putting them forth as stakeholders without their knowledge as a form of fronting in order to get a higher BEE ranking.The democratically elected government, 21 years into its tenure, is constantly reminded that a little over two decades should have been enough for it to have completely transformed South Africa.Maybe it is time companies are held to the same standard and expectation. The 17th Commission for Employment Equity (CEE) report showed that among other things, 68.5% of top management positions were occupied by whites, 14.4% by Africans, 8.9% by coloureds and 3.4% by foreign nationals.Men occupied 78% of top management positions and women 22%, with people with disabilities constituting 1.2% of top management.Whites occupied 72% of the positions in the private sector and Africans 73.2% of the positions in the public sector.White people held 58.1% of senior management positions black people held 22.1% Indian people held 10.6% coloured people held 7.7% and foreign nationals held 1.4%.In the professionally qualified category 41.5% of positions are occupied by black people 37.5% by white people 9.7% by coloured people 8.5% by Indian people and 2.8% by foreign nationals.Technically skilled positions were mostly held by black people at 60.2% followed by white people at 20.8% coloured people at 11.5% Indian people at 5.8% and foreign nationals at 1.8%.Semi-skilled labour positions are mostly held by black people at 76.1%. At the unskilled level 83.2% of positions are held by black people.Last year s CEE report unsurprisingly showed that the pace of transformation was to say the least, pedestrian, especially at the upper levels of management where whites (especially males) still dominate.This, despite the common misconception that whites are being pushed into the margins by their black counterparts because they are being forced to do so because of legislation.But the numbers don t lie there are nearly 70% (68.9%) white people at top management level, more than six times their economically active population.The report said the top management levels in the public sector are mostly populated by black South Africans, while white people were mostly concentrated in the private sector.The CEE said the SA economy remains white male dominated in most sectors of the economy. Clearly progress has been slow.Institutionalised discrimination continues to hold back real transformation in companies.Companies need to realise that B-BBEE is not just a piece of legislation that they are expected to comply with, but rather a transformational imperative that will in the long run make sense for their bottom line.Surely the advancement of a truly inclusive, in the practical/pragmatic sense, would yield greater economic stimulation. The inability of companies to see this speaks to their lack of interest in sustainable economic development.Therefore, B-BBEE has to be enforced and is here to stay.Economic apartheid cannot and must not be allowed to continue.Meokgo Matuba is secretary-general of the ANC Women s League
