Students at the new University of Mpumalanga have been urged to remain committed to their studies because education is regarded as the most important tool to achieve success.Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, in his capacity as the university s chancellor, made the plea during the institution s first graduation ceremony in Mbombela at the weekend. The university s first group of graduates received diplomas and degrees in the fields of agriculture and hospitality.Ramaphosa said the graduates should ensure that they utilised their qualifications to help create job opportunities in order to conquer the triple challenges of poverty, unemployment and inequality encountered by various communities.He also called on the graduates to continue furthering their studies to advance their educational knowledge and become tomorrow s best future leaders. The infrastructure of the University of Mpumalanga is cutting edge but, more importantly, it is building the instruments of academic instruction, graduating the first cohort of students who began their course of study at this university, Ramaphosa said. The young people who are graduating today are not the sons and daughters of the privileged. They are the sons and daughters of those people who have toiled, who have struggled and who also sacrificed much to build a better future for our children. Ramaphosa also voiced his satisfaction regarding the construction of the university.The University of Mpumalanga opened its doors in 2014 following President Jacob Zuma s call for Mpumalanga and Northern Cape to have their own institutions of higher learning.It incorporates the infrastructure of three existing institutions the Lowveld College of Agriculture, the hospitality school at KaNyamazane and the Siyabuswa Education Campus.It offers Bachelor of Education and Bachelor of Agriculture degrees, as well as a diploma in hospitality management.FRANCE NYAKAfrancen@thenewage.co.za
