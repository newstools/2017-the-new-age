Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has called on the Hawks to speedily investigate the theft of 33 firearms that disappeared from two police stations (Bellville South and Mitchell s Plain) in Cape Town.This comes after it was discovered that 18 firearms which were handed in as exhibit could not be accounted for in Bellville South Police Station and 15 state issued firearms were also missing. Police stations are supposed to be safe havens for all. When firearms in the hands of police go missing, there must be dire consequences.&#8220;People from Cape Town are already plagued by ugly scenes of gang violence and other serious crimes where innocent people including children get killed on a regular basis. What cannot be tolerated is violence sponsored from within the police ranks,&#8221; said Mbalula.Mbalula reiterated his previous call that those responsible must face the full might of the law. In the main, it is these guns that end up in the hands of gangsters, who daily torment our people, and destroy the lives of many young people, he said.-TNA Reporter &nbsp;
