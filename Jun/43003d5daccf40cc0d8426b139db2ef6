The dismissal of the North West MEC for public works Madoda Sambatha had to do with alleged fraudulent selling of government land, the North West ANC has alleged.The office of the premier announced last night that Sambatha, also the provincial secretary of the South African Communist Party, had given reasons in writing for his dismissal.ANC provincial secretary Dakota Legoete said Sambatha had admitted that fraudulent document bore his signature, but that he had been misled into signing the document. A meeting was convened with the ANC Bokone Bophirima provincial executive officials with Sambatha on Wednesday, Legoete said.Legoete said the PEC had resolved that an investigation must be undertaken to look into other land transactions, and that Sambatha must face an ANC disciplinary process.Several attempts to have Sambatha comment on his dismal were unsuccessful.-Siphiwe Mchunu
