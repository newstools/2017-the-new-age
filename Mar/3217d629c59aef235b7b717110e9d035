Former group acting Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) Collins Letsoalo’s court application has been dismissed. Letsoalo wanted to be included as an intervening party in the court application between former Board chairperson Popo Molefe and transport Minister Dipuo Peters. The Gauteng High Court on Thursday postponed the case to allow the Minister more time to prepare her response to the application regarding her decision to dissolve the board and appointing an interim board. Peters dismissed the board after the acting CEO was sent packing, for allegedly awarding himself a 350% salary hike. Meanwhile, in her affidavit before the high court, Peters said some employees reporting to Molefe were earning more than R4 million a year. Molefe accused the Minister of protecting some individuals within Prasa in her bid to block the board’s probe into wasteful, fruitless and irregular spending totaling some R14 billion. The court is still in session in Gauteng High court. -Sipho Jack
