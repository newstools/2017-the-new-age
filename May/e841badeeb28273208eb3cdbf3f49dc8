Jakarta&#8217;s Christian governor was jailed for two years Tuesday after being found guilty of committing blasphemy, capping a saga seen as a test of religious tolerance in the world&#8217;s most populous Muslim-majority nation.Presiding judge Dwiarso Budi Santiarto told the Jakarta court that Basuki Tjahaja Purnama was &#8220;convincingly guilty of committing blasphemy and is sentenced to two years in prison&#8221;.He ordered Purnama, known by his nickname Ahok, to be detained. Purnama said: &#8220;We will file an appeal.&#8221; Islamic hardliners outside the court cheered as news of verdict emerged and shouted &#8220;God is greatest&#8221;.Purnama was hauled into court last year to face trial for allegedly insulting Islam while campaigning for re-election in a case critics said was politically motivated.The trial came after a series of major protests against the capital&#8217;s leader that drew hundreds of thousands onto the streets.His once unassailable opinion poll lead shrank amid the controversy and he lost the race to lead Jakarta last month to a Muslim challenger, a result that fuelled fears of Indonesia&#8217;s moderate brand of Islam coming under threat from increasingly influential radicals.-AFP
