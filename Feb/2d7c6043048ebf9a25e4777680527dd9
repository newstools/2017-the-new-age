As part of its effort to implement President Jacob Zuma s radical economic transformation agenda, Durban Tourism, a wing of the city of Durban, spent a large chunk of its Metro FM awards budget on township and blackowned businesses.This was to ensure that these businesses get exposure and benefit from the money-spinning awards which were hosted in the city for the fifth time on Saturday at the Durban ICC.The budget for the award s festivities was worth R500000.Speaking on the eThekwini municipality s drive to push ahead with transformation of the economy on the sidelines of the awards, Philip Sithole, the head of Durban Tourism, said this was an intensification of their agenda to put township tourism on the map and benefit black business.He said more was yet to come for township-based tourism establishments and black-owned businesses which will be given priority in terms of procurement and hosting of visitors whenever Durban hosts a major event. This was an intensification of what we always do to ensure that township tourism establishments and blackowned benefit whenever there is a major event in our city. Townships will always be our priority in the city, Sithole said.Among the establishments that have benefited were KwaMashu s Artizen Lounge, Eyadini Lounge and Maxi s Lifestyle in Umlazi.Out of the township were blackowned establishments like Bertoa cafe in Musgrave and Classique braai lounge in Hillcrest.Sithole said eThekwini supported these establishments because they were owned by the previously disadvantaged. In as much as these establishments and others are based in affluent parts of the city, we support them because they are black-owned and they have taken some unique concepts from the townships to the suburbs, Sithole said.Sithole, who champions the promotion of Durban to the world, added whenever there are visitors or delegates from outside the country, they will take them to townships for meetings and to make them feel the warmth of the people.SIHLE MAVUSOnews@thenewage.co.za
