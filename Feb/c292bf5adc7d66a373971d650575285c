Parliament s presiding officers are due to receive a report tomorrow into the mayhem that disrupted president Jacob Zuma s Sona last Thursday.This was said yesterday by the institution s spokesperson Manelisi Wolela.At the same time, the DA said it was studying footage of the incident to see if people other than Parliament s presiding officers were on duty in the house last week. If this was the case the presence of police would have been in contravention of a court ruling.Last Thursday s opening night was disrupted as the EFF tried to scupper President Jacob Zuma s official opening and the speaker, Baleka Mbete, ordered the Parliamentary Protection Services to remove EFF members of Parliament from the chamber.Bricks, plastic hats and punches caused injuries to eight members of the parliamentary protection forces as they evicted EFF MPs from the National Assembly.They are receiving medical and counselling services, Parliament said in a statement, which added that secretary to Parliament Gengezi Mgidlana has established an interdivisional committee to investigate incidents that occurred last Thursday night.This committee is expected to table a report to the presiding officers tomorrow for a decision on the course of action Parliament will take.Parliament s statement said: The allegations of brutality levelled at PPS officials are unfair. Evidence shown on national television stations clearly indicates that these officials were brutally assaulted when they were merely doing their work of removing some MPs as instructed by the presiding officers. They have done their job successfully, in spite of the difficult conditions created by some of the MPs. Equally so allegations that the PPS had any weaponry such as cable ties, injections or any other equipment are false. At a press conference yesterday DA federal council chair James Selfe said that the party has had a categorical assurance from Parliament s presiding officers that there would not be a military presence at Parliament apart from those on ceremonial duty.However there were armed military personnel at Parliament, which meant that either the officers had lied or the military personnel were there illegally.The ANC has condemned what it called the repulsive conduct of the EFF.Chief whip Jackson Mthembu said: The behaviour of these MPs warrants a criminal and parliamentary investigation by the powers and privileges committee. A clear message must be sent to these individuals that the people s institutions cannot be subjected to acts of criminality with impunity. DENNIS CRUYWAGENdennisc@thenewage.co.za
