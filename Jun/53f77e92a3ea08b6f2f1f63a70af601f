The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) yesterday said it was unconvinced that data released by Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) which reported mining job increases of 1.8% (or 8000 jobs) was a true reflection as retrenchments remained a scourge in mining. As you know the situation at Sibanye Gold s Cooke operations where close to 1100 of the NUM members have been dismissed. We do not really see mining jobs increases that Stats SA is reporting about. Things on the ground have been experienced differently by the NUM, national spokesperson Livhuwani Mammburu said.According to the Stats SA report released on Tuesday, employment contracted by 48000 jobs during the first quarter of the year. Sectors that recorded declines were trade with 1.5% (or 32000 jobs), business services 1% (or 23000 jobs), community services 0.3% (or 8000 jobs), manufacturing 0.3% (or 4000 jobs) and transport (0.2% or 1000 jobs). However, along with mining jobs increases, the construction industry recorded an increase of 2% (or 12 000 jobs).As the NUM we do not know if these increases in mining jobs are sustainable or not. If the report by Stats SA is true we then welcome it but our members encounter the daily threats of retrenchments and dismissals as they are common features in the South African mining industry, Mammburu said.The NUM said the Stats SA report was not specific with which sort of mining created all these jobs and that Stats SA should have for example identified whether coal, platinum or gold mining were the drivers of the increase in mining jobs.Meanwhile, Cosatu said they were mainly focused on job losses and that the triple challenges of inequality, poverty and unemployment had reached epidemic proportions.REFILWE MAGASHULEnews@thenewagee.co.za
