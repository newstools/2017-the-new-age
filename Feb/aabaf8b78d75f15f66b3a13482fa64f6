The long awaited delivery of textbooks and stationery for learners in Limpopo schools is over, the provincial Department of Basic Education said.The department said it has delivered all the pending supplies needed at schools that have been left short of teaching material at the beginning of the 2017 academic year.Basic Education provincial spokesperson Dr Naledzani Rasila said: &#8220;The delay came when we moved from the expired contract then the logistics delayed the new one.&#8221;Rasila confirmed that delivery for 2018 will be on time, as the current contract is for the next 3 years.He added that principals and teachers who run out of supplies should contact the toll free number which is 0800265266.For the past three years the provincial and national department have been dragged to court several times by civil rights groups demanding orders to force delivery of textbooks on time.In 2012, Section 27 and Basic Education For All launched an urgent application to force the government to give textbooks to pupils in Limpopo.At the time, more than 18000 textbooks had not been delivered to about 18 schools in the province.Furthermore, In January, the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) threatened to take legal action against the department if all outstanding textbooks and stationery are not delivered by January 26, 2017.Rasila added that they communicated with the SAHRC to indicate the commitment that they had made.-Keitumetsi Motlhale
