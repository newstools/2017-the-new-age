Communications Minister Faith Muthambi has come under fire for engaging in a power grab that sought to concentrate powers over the SABC into her ministry.An interim report by a parliamentary ad hoc committee into the SABC has also said that her role in the removal of non-executive members of the SABC Board, as well as her pressuring the board to appoint Hlaudi Motsoeneng as chief operating officer might well have been in contravention of the Constitution and Broadcasting Act.She is also suspected of having broken the Executive Code of Ethics and the Privileges Act.The SABC Board and Motsoeneng were also criticised in the interim report.The interim report also pilloried Muthambi s irregular amendment of the Memorandum of Incorporation, as well as her proposed amendments to the Broadcasting Act.This, according to the interim report released by the committee, demonstrate efforts to concentrate power in the ministry by curtailing and removing the powers of both the board as the accounting authority and Parliament s role in the appointment and removal of non-executive board members .The Interim Report was clear that the current Memorandum of Incorporation cannot be used as basis for interpretation as it is under dispute. Accepting the MOI would be tantamount to giving it the status of having repealed provisions of the Broadcasting Act .The interim report was adamant that the Broadcasting Act is undoubtedly specific to the SABC, and is therefore the primary law applicable to the public broadcaster .The interim report was candid about the SABC s cash reserves, which had been in decline in the past two years. In 2014 cash and cash equivalents amounted to R1,4bn, decreasing to R1bn in 2015 andR874,7m in the current financial year. Revenues need to increase significantly in order for the SABC to return to profitability, the interim report said.The broadcaster s cash balances after year-end also deteriorated. The bank balance dropped from R874,7m at the end of March 2016 to R837.8m at the end of April 2016. This represents a 4.2% decrease in one month. The SABC reported recurring losses for the past financial years. Losses are driven by employee costs, broadcasting costs and signal and distribution costs. Professional and consulting fees increased significantly, by 45%, the interim report said.Under fiduciary duties, the interim report the SABC Board was ultimately accountable and responsible to the shareholders for the performance and affairs of the broadcaster. The board must therefore retain full and effective control of the SABC and must give strategic direction to the SABC s management. It is responsible for ensuring that the SABC complies with all relevant laws, regulations and codes of business practice, the report said.Evidence during the inquiry, said the report, confirmed and in some instances revealed that the challenges faced by the Board, including instability, dysfunction and political interference, had impeded the board s ability to hold the SABC executives accountable.In addition instability at senior management level has had a significant impact on the SABC s ability to fully execute its mandate.On irregular expenditure in contravention of supply chain management, the interim report carried a table that showed in 2014, the SABC incurred irregular expenditure to the amount of R990.7m; R2.4 billion was incurred in prior years but discovered in 2014, resulting to a cumulative figure of R3.4bn.In 2016, R441,2m was incurred. In addition, R3.223bn was incurred in prior periods but only identified in 2016, resulting in the escalation of irregular expenditure to R5.1bn.Fruitless and wasteful expenditure, which has been defined as expenditure made in vain, totalled R34.7m in 2016. A total of R92.5m in fruitless and wasteful expenditure awaits condonation.On Parliament s role, the ad hoc committee acknowledged, that Parliament may have relinquished its constitutional duty to hold the executive and consecutive SABC boards to account. This may have rendered Parliament complicit in the gradual decline of good governance, accountability and commitment to public broadcasting at the SABC .When the committee requested documents to be handed in by the SABC before it began sitting in December the chairperson of the board, Prof Mbulaheni Maguvhe, through his legal representative informed the committee that certain documents could not be delivered because they were commercially sensitive.In its interim report the committee said: It should be noted that the committee does not consider any of the documents it has received as being commercially sensitive as Maguvhe has alleged. Out of eight members of what used to be then SABC board invited to give evidence, three declined. They were Dr Aaron Tshidzumba, Nomvula Mhlakaza and Thembinkosi Bonakele.Tshidzumba was unavailable on the dates on which the hearings were scheduled owing to prior commitments; Mhlakaza declined to participate as she did not wish to testify against a board she had served on since September 2013 and Bonakele declined as he had resigned from the board in October 2014 when he was appointed as a commissioner on the Competition Commission, the interim report said.Initially former SABC head of news and group CEO Jimmi Matthews declined to participate, but could not be accommodated when he later changed his mind and indicated his willingness to give oral evidence.According to the report, acting SABC political editor Sophie Mokoena would have appeared as a witness but later decided against doing so following consultations with the evidence leader .DENNIS CRUYWAGENnews@thenewage.co.za
