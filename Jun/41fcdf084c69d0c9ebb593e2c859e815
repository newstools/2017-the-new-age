Former national police commissioner Riah Phiyega earned more than R3m while she was on suspension for two years, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula said.But Phiyega was not the only senior police officer collecting millions while suspended.Mbalula said the former head of crime intelligence, Richard Mdluli, earned R8.3m from August 2011 to March this year.A disciplinary process against Mdluli has started.Mbalula was answering written Parliamentary questions from DA member of Parliament, Mike Redelinghuys.Redelinghuys asked him when Phiyega s suspension started and also for the total amount the South African Police Service had paid her.Mbalula said Phiyega was suspended from October 14, 2015. The total package that she received during this period was R3 292 785.55, of which her basic salary was R2095 502.70.Redelinghuys asked a similar question about Mdluli. During his suspension he earned R8 307 860.84, of which the biggest chunk was his basic salary of R4 985 795.27.Meanwhile, the DA, which has referred to Mdluli as a couch potato, will lay a complaint about the progress of the disciplinary process with the Public Services Commission which, it said, was empowered by the Constitution to investigate, monitor and evaluate the organisation and administration of the public service and of personnel practices of the public service. Mdluli s disciplinary proceedings have been drawn out for far too long and are in no way reflective of an effective administration of the public service. The process must be urgently expedited so that no more public money is flagrantly wasted, DA MP Zakhele Mbhele said.DENNIS CRUYWAGENdennisc@thenewage.co.za
