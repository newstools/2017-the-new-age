A baby boy has been born in Ukraine to an infertile couple after the first ever use of a new technique using the DNA of three parents, the head of a Kiev fertility clinic said Wednesday .The boy was conceived using DNA from his mother and father but also from an egg donor in a technique called pronuclear transfer, said Valeriy Zukin, director of the Nadiya private fertility clinic in Kiev.&#8220;It is the first delivery (using) pronuclear transfer all over the world,&#8221; Zukin told AFP.The clinic said in a statement that the 34-year-old mother gave birth to a healthy boy on January 5 after trying for a baby for more than 15 years and undergoing several failed rounds of IVFThis became possible after the woman&#8217;s eggs were fertilised with her partner&#8217;s sperm, but then their nuclei were transferred to a donor&#8217;s egg which had previously been stripped of its own nucleus.As a result of the procedure, the egg was almost entirely made up of genetic material from the couple, plus a very small amount (some 0.15 percent) of the female donor&#8217;s DNA.Zukin said he hopes the pronuclear transfer technique could help other women whose embryos stop developing at a very early stage of development during cycles of IVF.The boy is considered to be the second &#8220;three-parent&#8221; baby after a similar baby was born in Mexico in 2016 after the use of a different technique.Zukin said the pronuclear transfer method could be used to help women who suffer from a rare condition called embryo arrest.Zukin estimated that annually some two million women across the world try to have a baby using IVF and around 1 percent of these suffer embryo arrest.&#8220;So I think approximately 10-20 thousand women per year could be potential candidates for using this method,&#8221; Zukin said.Experts urged caution over using the method as a fertility treatment, however, stressing that it was intended for those at very high risk of passing on serious genetic disease.&#8220;Caution and safety assessment is urged before widespread use of this technology,&#8221; said Yacoub Khalaf, director of the Assisted Conception Unit at Guy&#8217;s and St Thomas&#8217; Hospital in London, quoted by the Science Media Centre website.-AFP
