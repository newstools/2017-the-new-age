Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger conceded his team had been punished for a &#8220;disastrous&#8221; performance after they were thrashed 4-0 by fellow Premier League title hopefuls Liverpool on Sunday.Liverpool scored through Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane, Mohamed Salah and Daniel Sturridge at Anfield to condemn Arsenal to a second successive defeat after last weekend&#8217;s 1-0 loss at Stoke City.&#8220;Mentally it was difficult,&#8221; Wenger told Sky Sports. &#8220;A very disappointing performance. It was disastrous.&#8220;The result is a consequence of the performance. It was not good enough. We were beaten everywhere physically and in the end we made it easier for them.&#8220;We have done recently well in the big games. That is why today is even more disappointing.&#8221;Arsenal goalkeeper Petr Cech was similarly damning.&#8220;The only positive out of the game is that we have time to respond, because it is early in the season,&#8221; he said.&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it can get any worse than this.&#8221;Wenger faced dissent from large sections of Arsenal&#8217;s support last season as his side missed out on Champions League qualification for the first time in 20 years.But he masterminded a stunning victory over Chelsea in the FA Cup final and then signed a new two-year contract.Asked about shouts of &#8220;Wenger out!&#8221; that were heard from the away end, Wenger replied: &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to answer that. It&#8217;s part of the crowd&#8217;s feeling.&#8220;If some people feel as if I am the problem, then I am sorry that I am the problem.&#8220;But we want the fans to be with us even when we lose like that. All we can do is come back and give them a different level of performance.&#8221;Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was left purring after a superb display that elevated his side to second place in the table behind Manchester United.&#8220;We were really well organised,&#8221; Klopp told BBC Sport.&#8220;If you give Arsenal space and time, you lose before the game starts, so I don&#8217;t think they could do a lot of what they wanted, Arsenal, and that is all credit to the boys because they worked really hard.&#8221;-AFP
