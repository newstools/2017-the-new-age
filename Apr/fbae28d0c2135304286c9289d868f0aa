(www.liverpoolfc.com)&#8220;We will fight for the Champions League spot. That&#8217;s the only thing we can do now. We can&#8217;t change this game anymore, so we have to look forward.With four games left to play, Liverpool visit Vicarage Road on Monday to face 10th-placed Watford, who have won their last three home fixtures.&#8220;Against Watford we can change everything and get a good result. We have to look game by game and at the end of the season we will see what happens,&#8221; said Wijnaldum.-AFP
