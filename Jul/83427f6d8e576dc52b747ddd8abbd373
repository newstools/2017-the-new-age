The DA has on Tuesday called on the Minister of Health, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi to make an urgent intervention to halt the looming National Pathology strike. The looming strike follows the admission by the National Health Laboratory Service’s (NHLS) which pronounced that it would not be able to meet the demanded 7.3% salary increase by the pathology professionals and their trade unions. However NHLS says that it was only able to offer the professionals a 3% salary increase. Unions are allegedly finalising their strike ballot and could be on a national strike this week. “It is crucial that arrangements are made with private laboratories in advance, as a strike at the NHLS will be devastating for patients in need of urgent tests for HIV/Aids, Malaria, Cancer and Multi-Drug Resistant TB,” the DA said in a statement. The DA also request that the Minister provides a detailed plan of action in order to mitigate the possible consequences which will be caused by this strike. A recent strike by mortuary workers in Gauteng left devastating consequences in a number of mortuaries where families waited weeks to conduct burials for their deceased family members. “These strikes, like the mortuary strike in Gauteng, can have debilitating implications on the healthcare sector. We simply cannot have another Life Esidimeni or oncology crisis as we saw in KwaZulu-Natal, which cost hundreds of sick and vulnerable South Africans their lives,” said DA. -TNA Reporter
