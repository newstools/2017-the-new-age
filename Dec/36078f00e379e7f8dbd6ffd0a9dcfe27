ANC presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma has urged delegates headed to the national elective conference to commit that they will accept the results and outcomes thereof. Speaking during the KwaZulu-Natal provincial general council (PGC) an emboldened Dlamini Zuma stressed the need for the ANC to emerge from the elective conference intact. “Let’s accept the results. Those who win should embrace everybody and those who lose should support those who win,” Dlamini Zuma said. On Tuesday morning, the official results of the nominations by branches in the leadership race underwent a review during a open session. The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) verified the nomination results following allegations of vote tampering. Dlamini Zuma gained 21 more nominations, bringing the total number of votes in her favour to 454. On Monday, it was announced that she had received 433 nominations. Her rival in the presidential race, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa’s nominations were scaled down from 193 to 191. The former AU chairperson also stressed that the unity of the ANC remained imperative as well as the decorum of the conference, which begins on 16 December. “The conference of the ANC must be the safest place to be. When our families release us to go to the conference, they must not have any worries about our safety inside the conference.” Dlamini Zuma also urged delegates to sing songs that will unite the party and not only the songs of the presidential hopefuls. “The ANC conference is of interest to the whole world and the ANC must survive so that we are able to give to future generations, intact.”  -TNA Reporter
