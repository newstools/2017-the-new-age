Manchester United moved up to fifth in the Premier League on Sunday with a 3-1 victory away to struggling Middlesbrough, who sacked manager Aitor Karanka on Thursday.Jose Mourinho had said his team would &#8220;probably lose&#8221; because their current fixture congestion would lead to fatigue, but despite missing Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Paul Pogba, Wayne Rooney and Ander Herrera, they counter-attacked well.Belgium international Marouane Fellaini headed them in front after almost half an hour&#8217;s play for his first league goal of the season and Jesse Lingard scored the second just after the hour mark from 20 metres.Boro&#8217; substitute Rudy Gestede pulled a goal back with 12 minutes left, but in added time goalkeeper Victor Valdes slipped, allowing Antonio Valencia to score a third United goal.Middlesbrough, by far the lowest scoring team in the league, have still not won a league game in 2017.With United going into the game unbeaten in the league since October, there could hardly have been a greater contrast between the two sides&#8217; form.By halftime Mourinho&#8217;s side had made twice as many chances and taken the lead.Valdes, after saving with his legs in quick succession, from Rashford and Valencia, was caught in no-man&#8217;s land when Ashley Young crossed for Fellaini to head home.It was the Belgian&#8217;s first in the league since December 2015.The second goal came from a classic break after regaining possession. The home defence stood off for too long, allowing Lingard to run on and score with a fierce drive from just outside the penalty area.Boro&#8217; did show greater attacking intent than in many games this season and pulled a goal back when Chris Smalling failed to clear and Gestede poked in from close range.Any hopes of a dramatic recovery were dashed, however, when Valdes fell over lining up a clearance and Valencia was able to walk the ball into an empty net.Mourinho praised the &#8220;attitude and desire&#8221; of his players.&#8220;Our guys gave absolutely everything and were magnificent,&#8221; he told BT Sport.Victory made United the first club to record 600 wins since the Premier League began in 1992.They moved to within three points of fourth-placed Liverpool while Boro, who have scored only three league goals this year and 20 all season, remain bottom but one. -Reuters
