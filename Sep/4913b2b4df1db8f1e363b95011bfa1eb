It s a massive challenge for us, we re under no illusions. We ve shown tremendous improvement as a team so far this season, but this is a huge test for us this weekend, said Coetzee.The Boks were joined by Ruan Dreyer in Perth to complete the assembly of the full Springbok squad.The front ranker arrived at around midday at the team hotel and joined his teammates shortly after lunch on the training fields of the nearby Hale High School.Springbok vice-captain, Siya Kolisi said the preparations for Saturday s clash is going well. We put in a couple of hard sessions in Johannesburg before we flew over, and the full squad kicked off the week s preparations with another good training effort here at the school. It was nice to hear so many South African accents amongst the spectators, it s always pleasing to get good support here in Perth and the boys enjoyed the interaction afterward with the supporters, said Kolisi.
