Under-reporting of the abuse and neglect of the elderly, may be an indicator of a bigger social problem, according to the South African Human Right Council, which said at least 3% of the complaints it received in the past financial year, were on the alleged violation on the grounds of age.The SAHRC s Gushwell Brooks noted when conducting inspections at various residential facilities as part of the commission s investigation process when handling complaints, that many older persons were unaware of their rights. It could be argued that the biggest challenge to realising the rights of older persons is the general attitude of society towards older people, as reflected in the way they are treated, he said.KwaZulu-Natal recently experienced an increase in the number of cases of elderly abuse. They include rape, neglect, assault, robbery especially of pension money and often committed by those close to them.In 2015 the community of Mtubatuba was left in shock after 78-year-old Fikile Sithole from the Nkundusi area died while in hiding from her 58-year-old son Bonginkosi Sithole.The pensioner had run away from home after allegedly being abused for a long time by her son, who repeatedly raped, assaulted and stole her pension money. After reporting him to the police, she feared he would return and inflict more pain on her so she fled her home.In 2016, in Umlazi township, there was outrage among the community of L-section, following the rape and murder of 79-year-old Belinda Mthabela by her 32-year-old neighbour who was on parole for another rape charge.The pensioner who lived alone at her home had relatives living nearby.A neighbour said two local boys were walking past Mthabela s home when they heard noises from inside and looked through the window and saw a knife on the chair but not the pensioner.Knowing she lived alone they forced the door open and found the suspect naked. A plastic bag covered Mthabela s face.Mthabela s niece and a neighbour to the accused Ntombenhle Ncalane said she regreted not forcing the pensioner to spend the night with her on that fateful evening. I will always have that regret. If only I could have made her stay instead of going home. When he walked her home around 7pm we never thought that he would do this, especially to a defenceless old lady, Ncalane said.Society needs to work together, according to Femada Shamam of the Association For The Aged under the guidance of the Older Persons Act which provides the legal framework for the protection of the elderly.Shamam said the situation could be remedied by all stakeholders including medical professionals, social workers, members of SAPS as well as staff within the justice system working together to address the problem. The elderly living on their own should be prioritised for safety and security systems for the purposes of patrolling and monitoring.Family members have a large role to play as well by visiting their elderly relatives often and making sure that they are well, thereby alleviating their isolation which increases their risk of abuse, Shamam said.There are only eight government facilities that house the elderly.SIBONGISENI MAPHUMULOprovinces@thenewage.co.za
