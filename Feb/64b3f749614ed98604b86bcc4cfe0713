While searching around the pipes, we found one shoe.&#8220;Emergency services were immediately alerted and responded at about 4pm to the scene in Winnie Mandela Zone,&#8221; Malatsi&#8217;s mother said.EMS Spokesperson William Ntladi said the search along the stream was initiated by rescue teams from both Ekurhuleni Emergency Services and the SAPS K-9 Unit until around 7pm when the search was called off without success.&#8220;The search resumed Tuesday morning where rescue officials discovered the body. Information on-scene states that four pupils from the same school attempted to cross a strong stream before the tragic incident happened,&#8221; Ntladi said.Ntladi added that the other three pupils watched horrifically as their friend got swept away by the strong water and finally disappeared. Eventually the three girls managed to reach safety and call for help.Members of the public who witnessed the incident also tried in vain to save her life.Yvonne Mpesheya
