Zille&#8217;s representations on why she must not be suspended unveil the internal battle of the soul of the DA. She is not only fighting to remain premier but she is fighting to keep the liberal ethos of the DA alive.The question is, which way will the Western Cape caucus go?In the year 2000 Nelson Mandela once said that: (The) DA is a party of white bosses and black stooges which cares for black voters on the eve of the election. What picture does this paint about the DA that today shields its racial agenda by hanging on to a distortion of the legacy that Mandela stood for.The DA willingly or unwittingly can never wash away the white privilege that still lingers in the consciousness of many white liberal South Africans.If Mmusi Maimane thinks that Helen Zille will go easily, he must think again. Helen Zille is South Africa s iron lady. She has survived up until now and been able to deliver electoral successes for the DA because she is a liberal to the core. In this liberal democracy of ours, it is liberals who win.The slave cannot shackle the master and if the slave sees a mirage of freedom, the master will whip the slave so much that the slave quickly remembers its place in the society.In her response to the letter of the chairperson of the DA s federal executive, James Selfe, a letter that had requested her to make representations why she should not be suspended, Zille outlined two elements that would appeal to any liberal conscience. Firstly, the rule of law and secondly, the right to freedom of expression.Any layperson would know that Maimane s initial declaration of suspension was a downright politically immature mess. Selfe later confirmed this, saying that the DA s Federal Constitution allowed for Zille to make these representations, within a certain period of time, before a final decision could be made.Her making representations and her right to do so is based, one could argue, on a liberal principle of audi alteram partem. The other side must be heard.Maimane though is politicising the process and is therefore not interested in following proper procedure. For him, the rule of law is a means to an end rather than an end in itself, as would be the case for a liberal.Zille points this out when she says: This initial material failure to comply with due process (not to comply with the liberal principle) has serious implications. The leader has, in a public statement, made it clear that he wants me suspended and has already decided to suspend me In other words, in this instance, Zille would have no objection if she was suspended, but the proper procedures must be followed first; this after she has had the opportunity to argue why she should not be suspended.While the entire first section, 10 out of 45 paragraphs, of Zille s response is dedicated to issues of procedure, she goes on to question procedural points about timing. Why was she not suspended when she was charged, she asks. The constitution of the Western Cape mirrors the provisions made in the Constitution of the Republic under which circumstances the premier made be removed.Two-thirds of the provincial parliament will need to vote in favour of the premier s removal if they have found him or her to, a) have seriously violated the Constitution of the Republic or of the Western Cape, b) be guilty of serious misconduct, or c) be unable to perform the functions of the office.Presently, Zille cannot be found guilty on any of these.As with the Constitution of the Republic, the preamble of the constitution of the Western Cape reads: recognising and striving to heal the injustices of the past&#8230; recognising the need for peace, justice and reconciliation . While one could argue that Zille was guilty of not recognising the injustices of the past or that she was not recognising the need for reconciliation, it is hard to judge this seriously enough to warrant her removal.Yet both constitutions provide for a vote of no confidence in the premier. In this instance, a simple majority is required. The political question of course remains whether DA members of the Western Cape caucus will follow an instruction from the federal executive to pass such a vote.Herein lies the second liberal element, the right to freedom of expression, which Zille addresses. In her response, Zille maintains the right of the Western Cape provincial council to adopt such a motion.In defending two members of her inner circle, Bonginkhosi Madikizela and Debbie Sch fer, who proposed the motion as well as three others including Ivan Meyer, who drafted the motion , she states that the executive dismissal of the motion shows how executive is trying to clamp down on any dissenting voice in the party, while using (her) as a scapegoat. Furthermore, in her 28th paragraph she refers to a meeting she held with Maimane, in the presence of her legal representative.A meeting that should have been off the record, she states, but which has now become a source of information being used against her.Zille is explicit though that these are the kinds of discussions that SHOULD (sic) be the substance of debate in a political party. If a person can be suspended for simply expressing a different view, in confidential conversations, to that of the leader, the DA is on a slippery slope, and no longer represents or upholds the values of freedom, fairness and opportunity No-one else will feel free to express a contrary opinion to that of the leader The existential question for the DA and its members is therefore whether they will go with Maimane s vision of a new DA where the rule of law and freedom of expression are merely a means to power, which is the goal, or whether they will remain faithful to the traditional values of the DA, represented by Zille, through liberalism and defend these rights as goals in themselves.Both Maimane and Zille admit they hold very different views of the future of the DA.The old is refusing to die, while the new is struggling to be born. This is what faces many organisations in the post-apartheid era.Maimane s clear political project is that Zille must lose the premiership. Her vision and values and those who support her, have no place in his administration.How long will the divisions of the Liberal DA be managed and kept under the radar? In 2014 in Gauteng, Maimane, running as provincial premier with R100m budget, was able to up the DA s votes from 21% in 2009 to 30% in 2014.In other words, he was able to increase DA votes by nearly 400000 or 9% .Zille on the other hand, with half of Gauteng s voting population in the Western Cape, was able to increase DA votes by 200 000 or 8%. In 2009, the DA received 51% of the vote, in 2014 it was 59%.Unlike Maimane, Zille had an entire administration behind her and a term in hand, but could not reap the same results in 2014.Even more so, it would seem that growth areas for the DA, like Gauteng, are squarely behind Maimane and his politics.Lwandile Mtsolo is the chairperson of Sasco in KZN and Buyile Sangolekhaya Matiwane the chairperson of Sasco in the Western Cape
