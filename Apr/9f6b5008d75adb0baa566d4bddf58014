Cosatu has called on its members not to participate in Friday&#8217;s &#8220;peoples march&#8221; saying they wont march alongside agents of monopoly capital to remove a democratically elected government.&#8220;We refuse to be useful idiots to those who want to remove President Zuma in order to remove the ANC from power and protect their ill-gotten wealth and inherited privileges.&#8220;We do not support the regime change agenda. These are the same employers who always refuse workers, the right to participate in May Day activities and who will not hesitate to deduct workers wages when workers embark on genuine struggles for a living wage,&#8221; said Cosatu spokesperson Sizwe Pamla in a statement.Thousands of South Africans are on Friday expected to take to the streets across the country s major cities to take part in multiple protest marches.The protests have largely been sparked by the cabinet reshuffle announced by President Jacob Zuma last week.During the fallout from last week&#8217;s cabinet reshuffle, Cosatu said it could no longer ignore Zuma&#8217;s negligent and disruptive actions and called for him to step down with immediate effect.Cosatu said Zuma s attempts to seek an audience on the reasoning behind last week s reshuffle were a little too late.However on Thursday Cosatu called on the alliance partners to close ranks against organisations it accuses of pushing a regime change agenda.&#8220;Despite our strong differences, we should not walk in fear of another and allow to be driven by that fear into an age of unreason,&#8221; said Pamla.Cosatu pledged to host a protest march of its own against racism and neo-colonialism.&#8220;This will include a march to remove racists like Helen Zille of DA wherever they are in charge of economic and or political levers of power,&#8221; Pamla said.Meanwhile DA leader Mmusi Maimane has accused the ANC of undermining the right to stage a protest saying the party has &#8220;threatened peaceful marches and gatherings with violence.&#8221;&#8220;These threats and actions must be rejected by all South Africans who believe in democracy and the rights enshrined in the Constitution.&#8220;I have today spoken with the Acting National Police Commissioner, General Khomotso Phahlane, to assure him that the DA will conduct itself in a peaceful and democratic manner,&#8221; said Maimane.The ANC has called for calm to prevail during the multiple protests. The ANC is concerned at reports of sporadic violence and intimidation in the run-up to the planned so-called day of action on the 7th of April. Such actions have no place in democratic South Africa and threaten to turn the country back to a time where civic activism by citizens was stifled in the name of preserving law and order, said the ANC in a statement,&#8221; said the ANC.-TNA Reporter
