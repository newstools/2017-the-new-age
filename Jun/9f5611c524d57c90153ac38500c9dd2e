The rand dropped like a stone yesterday after public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane recommended constitutional changes that would alter the objectives of the Reserve Bank to focus on economic growth rather than currency and price stability.The currency, which has been relatively strong in the past few weeks, nosedived 3% during the day to trade at almost R13/$, having opened at R12.80/$.Shares in Barclays Africa tumbled 2.61% to R142.68 on the protector s comments that the bank-owned Absa had unduly benefited from apartheid era bailouts and must repay R1.125bn. Government bonds also weakened.Mkhwebane said the Constitution should be changed to state that the primary objective of the Reserve Bank should be to promote balanced and sustainable economic growth. She said the phrase to protect the value of the currency should be removed.The government and the Reserve Bank had failed in their role over the Absa bailout, she said. It is unclear why she deviated into monetary policy as she delivered her findings against Barclays Africa.Nomura emerging markets economist Peter Attard Montalto said it was quite unusual that a public protector has been so specific on changing the Constitution or indeed be so radical on transformation. I see the Bank strongly and resolutely defending its independence and existing mandate including via court action if necessary, he said. Absa denied any wrongdoing. Ian Cruickshanks, chief economist of the Institute of Race Relations, said yesterday s developments were likely to hurt the bank s share price and the sale price of Barclays Africa, the owner of Absa.BERNARD SATHEKGE bernards@thenewage.co.za
