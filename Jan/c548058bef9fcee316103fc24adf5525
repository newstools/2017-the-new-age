Chears to you if you still look lovingly at your partner every time you re together and even better if the mere thought of being apart gives you hives.The New Year can be gloomy for many couples whose relationship feels more like a boxing ring than a love affair.One in five divorces are filed in January. A recent startling report by legal firm Co-operative Legal Services predicted a 332% rise in divorce inquiries in January compared with previous months.The high rate of divorce during this time of the year shows that the trend is often blamed on stress that comes with important family celebrations such as Christmas. However, it turns out that this is not always the case Separation or divorce is usually already in the pipeline, Sam Hickman, head of family law at Co-Op Legal Services says. The decision to separate is not taken lightly and couples have already considered divorcing for a number of months and hold off announcing their plans until after the festive period, mainly to avoid upset among family members, Hickman said.According to the research, which involved 500 divorcees, 27% of men are marginally more likely than women (23%) to refrain from instigating divorce proceedings until after a significant family event.Looking to make a fresh start and get out of crumbling marriages, women are overall more likely to raise the issue of separation and divorce than men. While infidelity still plays a significant role in many of the couples filing for divorce, there usually are underlying reasons that causes a spouse to cheat anger, resentment, having varied interests, growing apart or unequal sexual appetites.Some of the most common reasons cited for divorce was adultery (51%), falling out of love (32%) and arguing more frequently (11%). The report backs a number of previous studies by divorce experts who claimed a pattern of an annual rush of divorce inquiries on the first full working day in January nicknamed Divorce Day.While in the past the apparent trend could have been easily attributed to several cases of extramarital affairs coming to light through festive calls and text messages, it is rarely, if ever, the direct cause of break-ups. At risk couples may be disillusioned if their hoped for idyllic family vacation was anything but, or come to the conclusion that their differences are in fact irreconcilable, University of Washington sociology professor Brian Serafini said.Serafini recently led a study that found that for troubled couples, the holidays may come as a time to mend relationships and start anew. Statistics South Africa shows 24 689 cases of divorce reported in 2014 an increase of 3.4% from the 23 885 cases processed in 2013.In 2014, black people accounted for 37.1% of divorcees, while 28.2% were from the white population group. The 2014 data released showed that more wives 12 769 (51.7%) than husbands 8 499 (34.4%) initiated the divorce.-TNA Reporter
