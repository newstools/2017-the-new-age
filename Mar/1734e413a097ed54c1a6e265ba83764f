The Soweto Eskom debt has increased by R2bn despite interventions to decrease the money the residents owe the power utility.Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe yesterday said Soweto has the largest outstanding debt increasing that has ballooned from R10bn last year to R12bn. Phasiwe said Eskom s debt collection efforts have been focused on Soweto as it is the area with the largest debt by installing smart and prepaid meters.He said to date they have installed 10 071 meters and have converted 10404 meters to prepaid. In Soweto prepaid meters are helping, out of 185 000 customers, only 50000 has prepaid meters. The majority of 130000 do not have them, it makes logical sense that there will be more debt coming through as more people are still using the post paid meters, Phasiwe said.Eskom also said the culture of nonpayment in Soweto has been a huge challenge for them.The debt owed by other municipalities increased again to a whopping R10bn. Most of the top defaulters that owe Eskom are in Mpumalanga, Free State and North west.Phasiwe said yesterday Eskom s executive appeared before Parliament s standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) to explain and put plans in place to deal with municipal debt. We have asked fellow parliamentarians to help with the debt and make sure that we have long lasting solution to the municipalities that are defaulting, he said.DIKELEDI RAMABOPAnews@thenewage.co.za
