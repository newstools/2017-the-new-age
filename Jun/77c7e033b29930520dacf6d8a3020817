Leopards maintained that play should have been stopped as their goalkeeper had been injured .Leopards&#8217; lawyer Advocate Justice Mnisi said the team would today write to the PSL, raising their concerns about the referee&#8217;s decision. We are saying this is a PSL matter and we believe the result must be nullified and the game must be replayed, Mnisi said. It is clear that on the day that the referee influenced the outcome of the game; it is clear that there was an infringement, there was contact and the goalkeeper sustained severe head injuries but the referee failed to the and Baroka FC as a result benefited from the such. Mnisi told the Metro FM.He said the goalkeeper had received medical attention for his injuries. Mnini said that they would not rest until they get a resolution in the matter. I can confirm that currently we hold instructions and resources to proceed with this matter until its finality, if it means we must go to Fifa we will go there if means we go to Safa we will go there, but it is our prayer that this matter must be treated as a matter of urgency.
