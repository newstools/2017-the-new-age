Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said his party&#8217;s stinging defeat in weekend Tokyo assembly elections represented a &#8220;severe criticism&#8221;, after it lost over half its seats in the vote in a historic loss.The polls, seen as a bellwether for national political sentiment, come as Abe is buffeted by a series of setbacks and scandals that have driven down his popularity.A new political party set up by former TV anchorwoman Yuriko Koike, elected Tokyo governor in a landslide vote last year, was able to capitalise on this to seize 49 seats out of 127, becoming the leading group in the capital&#8217;s assembly in Sunday&#8217;s election.&#8220;We have to take (the result) seriously as a severe criticism against our party the LDP,&#8221; a chastened Abe told reporters Monday morning, after his Liberal Democratic Party&#8217;s seat count shrunk dramatically from 57 to just 23, a record low.&#8220;I&#8217;m determined to reshape the party to work together and win back trust among the public through realising achievements,&#8221; he said.Abe was elected prime minister in late 2012 with a mandate to revitalise the economy.But the 62-year-old is under fire over allegations he showed favouritism to a friend in a business deal, which the prime minister has denied.The claims come a few months after he was forced to deny connections to the controversial director of a school that had purchased government land at a huge discount &#8212; and counted Abe&#8217;s wife as its honourary principal.Koike, 64, is a former member of parliament and defence minister who is widely seen as having ambitions to return to national politics and is touted as a strong candidate to be Japan&#8217;s first female prime minister.After the election, her Tomin First party increased its assembly seats to 55 by admitting six further candidates who had run as independents.A third party Komeito &#8212; a moderate party backed by a Buddhist-linked group &#8212; has long sided with Abe in national politics, but is cooperating with Koike&#8217;s local party in Tokyo.Its 23 seats, plus another belonging to a smaller party, gives Koike and her allies effective control of 79 seats in the assembly, a comfortable majority.-AFP
