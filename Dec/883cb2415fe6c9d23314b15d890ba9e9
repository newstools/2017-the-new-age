Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa’s presidency contention of the ANC received a boost after he was announced as Limpopo’s preferred candidate at the weekend. The deputy president received 391 votes from branches while Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma received 104 votes. Ramaphosa’s win in Limpopo puts him ahead of front-runner, Dlamini Zuma. Another presidential hopeful Lindiwe Sisulu received a nod as Ramaphosa’s deputy while Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe received a nod as the party’s chairperson and Senzo Mchunu as Secretary General. Gauteng ANC Chairperson Paul Mashatile was nominated as Treasurer-General. Prior to the announcement, the ANC’s chairperson in Limpopo Stan Mathabatha criticised the creeping materialism that is facing the ANC. Mathabatha urged delegates to choose leaders who would put the community’s interests ahead of their own. -TNA Reporter
