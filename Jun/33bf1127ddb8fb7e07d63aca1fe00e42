The Muslim fasting month of Ramadan comes to a conclusion this week, marking the end of the Islamic holy month that has about 1.6 billion people in the world participating.Ramadan is the ninth month in the Islamic lunar calendar and during this time Muslims all over the world spend time fasting, in prayer and doing charity. Those who are fasting have to abstain from food, liquids, sex or any personal desires before sunrise till sunset. The main aim of Ramadan is for us to learn piety, Sheik Shuaib, a local imam at a mosque in Sandton said.Fasting is also meant to instil self-discipline and enable Muslims to be compassionate towards the poor by depriving themselves of the pleasures such as hearty food they normally take for granted. When you are marking Ramadan, you are like a person that has been learning in a workshop and when you are outside the month of Ramadan, you have to continue with these good acts. Shuaib saidThis year s Ramadan commenced on May 26 and will end on Sunday or Monday whereafter Eid Al Fitr will be observed the next day.Shuaib said it is difficult to determine the date of Eid according to the Gregorian calendar accurately because the lunar calendar follows the sighting of the moon. If people are unable to see the moon themselves, they base it on the declaration in Saudi Arabia.Eid-ul-Fitr, Arabic for celebration of breaking the fast is the festival celebration that is observed just after the last night of Ramadan.This celebration happens on the first day of Shawwal, the 10th month in the Islamic lunar calendar and is the first and only day after Ramadan when no one is allowed to fast.On the day of Eid, Muslims wake up and take a bath before sunrise, thereafter many dress in their finest clothes.A sweet breakfast consisting of dates is always advised before going to the mosque to ensure that no one fasts during this day. Most Muslims attend congregational prayers, listen to a kutbah (sermon) and give zakat al-fitr on this day.The Eid salaah (prayer) is different as it only consists of two units of prayer and is performed after sunrise.After the Salah, Muslims prepare special meals that may be shared in the congregation, visit friends, family and give gifts to children.news@thenewage.co.za
