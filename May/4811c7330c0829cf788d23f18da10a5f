Film exhibitors Nu-Metro and SterKinekor are said to have been engaged in a market allocation dispute and are facing a hearing tomorrow brought by the Competition Commission.The regulator submitted that Primedia subsidiary Ster-Kinekor Theatres and Avusa subsidiary Nu-Metro Entertainment (Pty) Ltd engaged in market allocation conflict regarding lease agreements at the V&amp;A Waterfront shopping complex. Nu Metro and Ster-Kinekor are the two biggest competitors in the film exhibition market.The Competition Commission initiated the complaint in May 2009 after Avusa applied for conditional immunity and provided evidence of the existence of collusion in the film exhibition market at the V&amp;A Waterfront shopping complex in Cape Town. A lease agreement was entered into by Nu Metro with its then landlord Transnet Pension Fund, wherein Nu Metro had an oral right of first refusal in relation to any film exhibition on the Waterfront premises.When Nu Metro discovered that there were negotiations with SterKinekor, about the operator also operating at the Waterfront shopping complex, Nu Metro filed an interdict in the high court. Nu Metro and Ster-Kinekor later entered into a settlement agreement that was subsequently made an order of the court, in which Nu Metro would withdraw its objection to Ster-Kinekor s lease agreement and that Nu Metro would only show commercial films while Ster Kinekor could only show subtitled or art movies.It is this arrangement that the commission submits amounts to market allocation. The regulator said that it was asking for 10% of Ster-Kinekor s annual turnover.-THELMA NGOMA|thelman@thenewage.co.za
