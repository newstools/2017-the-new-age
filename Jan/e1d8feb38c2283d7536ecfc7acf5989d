South African-born comedian Trevor Noah is a brave man indeed.The host of The Daily Show recently took US president elect Donald Trump to task following Trump s tweet that his recent election as president was responsible for the good run the American economy was having in recent times.The comedian did not take kindly to Trump s tweet and wasted no time in telling him who is still the boss. The world was gloomy before I won there was no hope, Trump had tweeted. Now the market is up nearly 10% and Christmas spending is over a trillion dollars. Well, the no-nonsense comedian practically deflated Trump s inflated ego with a swift tweet: Yes, president @BarackObama is doing a good job. Trump is to be inaugurated as Obama s successor later this month.Twitter continued to have its own fun at Trump s expense with many joking that Trump s presidency will be a delusional one. Trump prematurely takes credit for other people s accomplishments. It seems he has premature issues, a Twitter user said. What a joke, another user went on to say. He s so delusional.I m embarrassed for our country. Noah has taken on Trump head-on, slamming him for bragging about evading tax and poking fun at his peculiar sneezing problem, among other things.SIYABONGA SITHOLE
