THE National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) has disbursed R12.4bn to both public universities and Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) colleges this year, a 34% increase from the previous year. The entity funded a total of 451 507 students this year compared to the 414 949 students supported last year. Of the funded students 225 950 were from universities with funding amounting to R10.3bn and 225 557 from TVET college students with funding amounting to R2.1bn. This was revealed in Parliament yesterday when NSFAS presented its annual report for the 2016-17 financial year to the portfolio committee on higher education and training yesterday. NSFAS board chairperson Sizwe Nxasana said: “It is pleasing to report that the total bursaries and subsidies enjoyed by NSFAS funded students during the year under review was R10.8bn. “Without these bursaries and subsidies outlined above, access to higher education for potentially deserving students will be much lower than is presently the case.” NSFAS spokesperson Kagisho Mamabolo said: “It is worth noting that of the R10.4bn disbursed to the universities to fund students, R5.2bn of that is in the form of bursaries and R3.5bn in the form of subsidies of interest and repayments to funded students. The total R2.1bn funding to TVET college students is 100% bursaries. “The most significant contribution to student funding was the Department of Higher Education and Training to the value of R11bn (81%), followed by the Department of Basic Education with R1.0bn (8%) and the National Skills Fund (6%). Other government departments contributed at least R310m. Grants for student funding increased by 51% from R9.1bn in the prior year to R13.8bn in the current year.” Collections have also increased by 73% from R226.7m to R392.4m in the prior year, exceeding the target of R285m by 38%. The entity failed to meet its collection target for the past few years. Recoveries re-injected to fund new students amounts to R900m in the 2016 academic year, an increase of 64% from R500m in the prior year. NSFAS also utilises the recovered funds to make upfront payments to institutions during the commencement of every academic year. This allows NSFAS funded students to register without paying registration fees. NSFAS CEO Steven Zwane said: “NSFAS is making significant progress in assisting more students and improving their service to students, universities and TVET colleges. We are also mindful of our responsibility to build trust between the organisation and its stakeholders. To this end we will be running a campaign to celebrate the achievements of beneficiaries.” -LILLIAN SELAPISA|lillians@thenewage.co.za
