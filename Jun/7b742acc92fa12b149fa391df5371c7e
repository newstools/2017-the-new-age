The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) has challenged the ANC KZN provincial leadership to choose between saving people s lives or the provincial health MEC Dr S bongiseni Dhlomo.This comes after the shocking findings by the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) into the poor state of oncology services in the province. It is high time now for the ANC provincial leadership to make a hard decision of whether it save lives for patients affected by the shortage of oncologists, and broken CT scanners in public hospitals, or prefers to allow Dr Sbongiseni Dhlomo to continue as an MEC. He has failed dismally to provide bold leadership in his department, provincial IFP spokesperson on health Ncamisile Nkwanyana said.Since 2011, many patients have died while on waiting list for the provincial health department to fix radiotherapy equipment. It is either the people of KwaZulu-Natal or Dr Dhlomo. We have raised several concerns in the past about the poor state of services offered by provincial hospitals but Dr Sbongiseni Dhlomo is turning a blind eye, and our concerns are falling on deaf eyes,&#8221;Nkwanyana said.Nkwanyana said the lack of basic resources in hospitals have reached critical levels. Several hospitals in the province are in a critical state of disrepair resulting in the violation of the public s right to health care services. As the IFP we are of the view that the MEC must be held personally responsible should any patient die as a result of adverse conditions at hospitals resulting from a lack of maintenance of equipment and infrastructure, concluded Nkwanyana.-TNA Reporter
