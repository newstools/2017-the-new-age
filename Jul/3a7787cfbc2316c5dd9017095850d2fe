Ajax right-back Kenny Tete joined Lyon in a four-year deal worth four million euros ($4.5m), the Ligue 1 outfit announced Monday.&#8220;It&#8217;s a real opportunity for us,&#8221; said Lyon coach Bruno Genesio.&#8221;The position of full-back has evolved a lot in recent seasons. You are asked to attack, to defend well, and to run fast and long. Kenny has this profile and we jumped at this opportunity.&#8220;It was not easy because there was a lot of competition to sign him.&#8221;&#8221;Lyon is a great club with a history,&#8221; said Tete.&#8221;It&#8217;s important for me to link up again with Bertrand Traore, who played down the right with me at Ajax.&#8221;The 21-year-old defender, who has six caps for the Dutch national team, added: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have a great year last season at Ajax, because of the manager&#8217;s choices, but I always remained positive and that&#8217;s a good attitude to take to Lyon.&#8221;The little I played was enough to convince Lyon to sign me.&#8221;Club president Jean-Michel Aulas and Genesio also confirmed they are targeting a central defender to strengthen Lyon&#8217;s squad.-AFP
