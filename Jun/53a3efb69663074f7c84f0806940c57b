The South African Agency for Science and Technology Advancement (Saasta) is trying to make science a sexy subject for young people by running weekly competitions on Instagram.The SA Science Lens Instagram competition aims to encourage young people between the ages of 13 and 25 to value science in their everyday lives, seeing how they view the world around them from a scientific perspective.Statistics show that performance in maths and science is poor across the education system with less than 25% of students who enrol at tertiary institutions for science subjects graduating. Many of these challenges have their roots in the basic education system.The Saasta competition caters for school pupils, tertiary students, early career scientists and science communicators, as well as photography enthusiasts. Since the beginning of June, every week has had a different theme that relates to global events.In the first week of the competition, it was World Environment Day and World Oceans Day, inspiring the theme of natural glamour.This was a chance for young South Africans to celebrate what the environment and the oceans mean to them.The final week, with the theme #shootingstar started on Monday and links to World Asteroid Day.Each week three winners are announced based on viewers choice (the number of likes the image receives) and two awards for commended images, as judged by the SA Science Lens team at Saasta. Winners receive data packages worth up to R250 and their images will be posted on the SA Science Lens Instagram and Saasta Twitter feeds.-Mpho Kobeli
