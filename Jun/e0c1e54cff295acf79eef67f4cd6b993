Description: https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gifThe group alleges that that more than 700 delegates registered to attend the national elective conference organised by the Kebby Maphatsoe faction were not bona fide MK military veterans.The group has since decided to dissociate itself with the conference, describing it as fraudulent .The conference, to be held in Johanneburg, is due to start tomorrow and end on Sunday.Expressing its disquiet, the leadership expressed dissatisfaction with the ANC for allowing the fraudulent conference to take place.Chairperson of the other faction, Kebby Maphatsoe said despite the conference being an elective conference, its priority was to prepare for the upcoming ANC policy conference.However, in a turn of events, Ntuli said his group would not accept the leadership that gets elected.Ntuli s faction also criticised its rival formation, the MK Council, for boycotting the conference saying this was immature . We believe that every effort and initiative must be an opportunity to extend engagement among ourselves to build unity. We hold strongly that our unity is of critical importance,&#8221; Maphatsoe s MKMVA member Ike Moroe said.This week MK Council leader Siphiwe Nyanda said the veterans had decided to boycott the conference, describing it as as a costly detraction from requisite efforts to save the ANC.&#8221;Maphatsoe has decried the Council s decision to boycott the conference. He claimed that it was not a legitimate structure of the ANC .-Siphiwe Mchunu
