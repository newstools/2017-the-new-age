The principal of KgolaThuto Secondary, the best performing in the province, said they were already working towards obtaining a 100% pass rate this year.The school obtained a 97% matric pass rate last year and the principal, Moses Malawana, said they would add the missing 3% this year. The excited Malawane said though it would have been a great feeling to see all his pupils pass matric, he was still satisfied with the 97% pass rate the school obtained.The school produced 11 pupils in the provincial top 100 best performing pupils, where four of the 11 were among the top 10. Malawane said commitment by everyone at the school was a key element of its success. If you allow every stakeholder to perform their role this is the kind of result one obtains, Malawane said. He stressed the importance of allowing the representative council of learners to be involved in the management of the school where they are needed especially for discipline of their fellow pupils. For a school which does not camp and works only for six days, we obtained a 47% bachelors pass rate, 38% diploma and only 8% higher certificate, we are indeed proud, he said. The school had 248 matriculants last year.The province obtained a 93.2% matric pass rate which is a record breaking result and the highest in the country. The province s pass rate increased by 5.5% from the 87.7% it obtained last .-Teboho Moloi|provinces@thenewage.co.za
