Hundreds of thousands of matriculants are set for disappointment as universities around the country will not be able to accommodate them.This as almost 600000 matriculants vie for 64400 available spaces at nine tertiary institutions.Its emerged that the institutions have received 586000 applications from prospective students with some individual universities receiving more than 100000 applications for just more than 5000 first-year spaces available.To assist the thousands who did well but could not be accepted, the Department of Higher Education and Training has called on the prospective students to register with its Central Application Clearing House.The service, established in 2012, is an online government platform established to assist students who want to access university, college and skills development opportunities in post-school education and training. The services are particularly useful for applicants who applied for admission to a university or college in time, but have not been offered a place or their programme of choice. It can also be useful for prospective students who achieved better results than expected and now wish to enrol for a different course or a university or technical college, Higher Education and Training spokesperson Madikwe Mabotha said.Mabotha said the service did not guarantee placement at an institution but the system had been proven to increase prospective students chances by making data readily available to all possible institutions in the post-school system. Applicants are matched to their examination results as supplied by the Department of Basic Education and the Independent Examination Board. The information is then shared with universities, technical colleges, setas and some registered private colleges. These institutions select potential students from the list and make direct contact with them, he said.Mabotha said the service was not only confined to university and college studies but also provided information on post school opportunities which included skills development opportunities and artisan programmes. In 2016 alone the clearing application successfully placed 40% of the registered 18747 applicants.Batandwa Malingobatandwam@thenewage.co.za
