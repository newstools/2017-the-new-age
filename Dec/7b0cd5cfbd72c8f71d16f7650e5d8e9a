The Department of Energy has announced the December petrol and Diesel increase from as of Wednesday. “Petrol will increase by 71 cents per liter, Diesel will increase by 57.3c/l and 60.3c/l‚ while the wholesale price of illuminating paraffin will rise by 73.3c/l.” The department attributed the fuel increase to the weakening of the rand and the increases in crude oil prices which hit two-year highs increase in well above $60/bbl‚ and the annual margins adjustment. “In line with the application of the Regulatory Accounts System, the Minister of Energy has approved a net increase of 3.9 c/l in the annual margin adjustments on petrol and a net increase of 0.7 cents per liter on secondary storage and secondary distribution margins. “The renewed tensions and uncertainties in the Middle East were also partly due to buoyant global demand expectations and the strong likelihood that OPEC will extend its output cuts programme well into the coming year,” the department said. -TNA Reporter
