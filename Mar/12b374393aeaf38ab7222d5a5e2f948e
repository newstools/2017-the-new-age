THE tie might look like a mountain to climb, but Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane believes his side can build on their 2-1 first leg win over Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) and go to the second round of the CAF Champions League.After being on cruise control in the first half at the Lucas Moripe Stadium where Bangaly and Ricardo Nascimento scored, the defending champions took their foot off the pedal and allowed Geoffrey Sserenkuma to score a valuable away goal for the hosts.The visitors appreciated the away goal and are now hoping it could be something to fight for when the two teams meet in Kampala on Saturday. While KCCA have something to give them hope of doing the unthinkable of knocking Sundowns out of the Champions League in the first round, Mosimane does not see his defending champions bowing out of the competition they won last season in the opening round. The Downs coach is adamant his side will score in Kampala. We always score at home but we concede as well. Maybe we like it the hard way. Maybe we were overconfident. We now have to go to Kampala and fight. We have to overturn the result. We have the experience even though there are no guarantees, Mosimane said. The away goal will only work for them if we don t score and also, if they score at home. But the goal that they scored here is a thorn in the side. We put ourselves in this position and we can only blame ourselves. We have to get ourselves out. We should roll up our sleeves there. We don t have to win there. We just have to get there and score, the Sundowns coach said.The fact that Al Ahly, Zamalek and TP Mazembe failed to make the group stages in the last three seasons when they were champions is not playing in the mind of Mosimane. All that the Sundowns coach is thinking about is how he will consolidate the lead in Kampala and already he sounds like a man with a plan.mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za-Mmasekepe Matsebane
