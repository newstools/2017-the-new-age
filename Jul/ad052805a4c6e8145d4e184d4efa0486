Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane has today approved platinum miner Lonmin&#8217;s section 11 application to acquire a 42.5% stake of, Pandora a joint venture with Anglo Platinum.Zwane&#8217;s granting of the application to acquire Pandora will reportedly save up to 3000 jobs which were at risk as the company was due to be placed under maintenance.&#8220;Lonmin came and presented its case to us, and one of our primary considerations when assessing their application was how we were best going to prevent retrenchments at the mine. We are indeed pleased that we have been able to save 3 000 jobs, particularly in the current global economic climate, said Zwane.This comes after Zwane last week announced a moratorium on the granting of applications for prospecting and mining rights as well as any renewals pending a court case to review the new mining charter. The moratorium would ensure that any applications are concluded in terms of the 2017 Mining Charter, Zwane saidHowever, the saving of jobs will come as welcome news in a sector that has been hard hit by recent economic downturns and has grappled with rampant job cuts.Recently Bokoni Platinum mine announced plans to retrench its entire workforce of more than 2 651 workers in Limpopo while last month AngloGold Ashanti announced its plan to retrench 8 500 workers.Related: NUM opposes Bokoni Platinum mine retrenchment planMeanwhile Amplats yesterday announced a 55% drop in its interim profits due to a strengthened Rand and overall lower sales volumes. The lower earnings were as a direct result of lower sales volume from mined production and a weaker basket price compared to H1 2016, the company said.-Siphiwe Mchunu
