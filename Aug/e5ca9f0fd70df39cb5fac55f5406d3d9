TEN-year-old Abriella Bredell will be the youngest swimmer to tackle the gruelling 7km swim from Cape Town to Robben Island when she undertakes one of the toughest open-water swims in the world in December to raise money for charity.Bredell, a Grade 5 pupil at Victory Christian School in Jeffreys Bay, is proof that dynamite comes in small packages.Bredell hopes to raise R2m for the Red Cross Children s Hospital. Her crowdfunding campaign has so far raised R41614.Bredell has a passion for swimming and has been swimming since the age of two at Brenton s Swim School and Liquid Lines.The youngster is well prepared for the swim between Robben Island and the Big Bay mainland. One of the biggest challenges she faces is the extreme cold as the water temperature is on average about 13 C. Bredell said: I train six times a week and love the open water. I have also started surfing in cold water so I think I will be able to swim to Robben Island in December. This is my first time crowdfunding and I really enjoy it. Just knowing that you can save someone s life is awesome. On why she chose the Red Cross Children s Hospital as the beneficiary of her swim, she said: It is a hospital where kids are helped in the best way possible, which is why I want to support them. I m excited and I know I will finish the swim but I am most excited to be able to raise money for the Red Cross Children s Hospital. Her mother, Lauryn Bredell, said she was impressed by her daughter s ambition and her willingness to push herself to the limit for the greater good.She said her daughter s record attempt was cool but the impact she can have on children s lives is what her campaign is about .Zane Groenewald, marketing officer at crowdfunding platform Backabuddy, said: Sporting events create a perfect opportunity for champions such as Abriella to crowdfund for a number of important causes and have become increasingly popular on our platform.
