Former ANC treasurer and Premier of Northern Cape Sylvia Lucas says the provincial conference had discrepancies in the nomination process leading to the conference.She said because of these discrepancies it would have been futile for her to participate in the elections. I believe the discrepancies mentioned in the acceptance of the credentials made it an exercise in futility to contest, said Lucas.She said she will ask the National Executive Committee to investigate the procedures that ahead of the conference.The dramatic events in which she and her slate declined nominations saw her left out of the provincial executive committee.Meanwhile, the newly-elected chairperson Zamani Saul said it was an individual right to decline nomination and further said Lucas was within her rights to take the matter to the NEC.During Thursday s registration processes Lucas supporters refused to adopt credentials seeking to legitimise of delegates, citing reasons of branch irregularities.The credentials were eventually accepted after long delays.-Sipho Jack
