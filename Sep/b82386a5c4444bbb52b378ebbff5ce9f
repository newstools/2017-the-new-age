Three Eastern Cape municipalities have been given up until Friday to make payment or arrange firm debt settlement proposals to Eskom.The pending interruptions of bulk electricity supply to Raymond Mhlaba, Walter Sisulu, and Inxuba Yethemba planned for Wednesday have been rescheduled to Friday, Eskom confirmed.&#8220;This is to allow the municipalities additional time to make adequate payment or to table firm debt settlement proposals to Eskom,&#8221; Eskom said in a statement.Eskom reported that they have been engaging the municipalities and the provincial government regarding the pending interruptions over the last few days and they are still hopeful that they will be able to find mutually acceptable solutions before Friday.DA PR councillor Nomvano Zibonda says the DA in Raymond Mhlaba municipality is very concerned about the Eskom debt issue.&#8220;According to our knowledge there is an arrangement that the council made with Eskom to settle/service the debt and the council were not made aware of challenges that could result in the municipality not honouring that arrangement,&#8221; she said.Zibonda said she has been trying to get hold of the municipal manager and the mayor with out any success.&#8220;The residents will suffer while they have been paying for their electricity and the municipality has not made any arrangements to engage and give a way forward, as a result some ratepayers associations are threatening legal action.&#8221;Executive Mayor of Raymond Mhlaba Municipality Bandile Ketelo said their debt with Eskom is a historical one which was inherited by his municipality with a recent merger of Nkonkobe and Nxuba Municipalities.&#8220;The debt is historic and mostly inherited from Nxuba municipality, this debt was in all probability a driver in the merger decision, in an attempt to establish good governance and financial viability.&#8220;I state categorically that the municipality is keenly aware of the challenge that the municipality is keen to address the debt in a responsible manner and that the municipality is obligated to find a solution acceptable to Eskom, yet one serving the needs of the residents and ratepayers depending on the municipality for continuous basic service delivery,&#8221; he said.Ketelo said on Thursday they will be meeting with Eskom to table their proposal.Meanwhile, Eskom has scheduled blackouts in seven Free State municipalities from the 27th of September due to the non-payment of municipal Eskom bulk electricity accounts.DA MPL James Letuka says collectively, Free State municipalities owe Eskom almost R5 billion.&#8220;Punitive scheduled blackouts will negatively affect the quality of life of the people and further stifle economic activity that will lead to further job losses which the Free State can ill afford.&#8220;It is also grossly unfair that businesses and residents who do pay their electricity accounts with municipalities will also be subjected to these blackouts,&#8221; he said.Eskom said they firmly believe that the interruption of supply to any customer for non-payment is always the option of last resort and they will continue to engage the municipalities over the next 2 days in an attempt to avert the supply interruptions.Zingiswa Mndayi
