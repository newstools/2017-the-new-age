Parents of a Tembisa school are furious with teachers who have not marked their children s books since the beginning of the year.Tshidi Mabaso, whose child is a Grade 5 pupil at Winnie Mandela Primary School, said she had noticed a pattern in her child s homework not being marked.Mabaso said she was worried because the progress of her child was being compromised when her work was not regularly checked.She said teachers had a duty to ensure that they monitored the progress of the pupils. However, the pattern of children s work not being marked is developing and this is a worrying trend. If teachers are not going to mark the work, why do they even bother giving them homework in the first place? she said.Gauteng department of education acting spokesperson Oupa Bodibe said no complaint had been lodged with the department.However, Bodibe said the department had dispatched officials to the school to investigate. The outcome of the investigation will be communicated in due case.An 11-year-old pupil said their teacher did not mark their school work and this was bothering him as he did not understand how his progress would be measured. I am worried that my teacher is not helping me to know whether I am making progress or not, the pupil said.The aunt of the pupil, Eulender Mabaso, said she helped her niece with homework and appealed to the teachers to do what was right by helping their children with homework. After all, children are the future of the nation and they need all the assistance and they also need to be properly nurtured, Mabaso said.provinces@thenewage.co.za
