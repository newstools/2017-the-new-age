The woman who was photographed sitting in a cage at the back of a bakkie, on Thursday said she chose to sit at the back.Linda, who has been identified as the woman in the photograph of the Isuzu bakkie with an Eastern Cape registration plate spoke about the incident in a video which was posted on Facebook.&#8220;I asked the boss for a lift to town and when we got to town he dropped me off at the garage. The boss said I must sit in front, but i chose to sit at the back cause that&#8217;s where we usually sit,&#8221; said Linda.Speaking in Afrikaans in the video clip, a white woman asked Linda to explain that the driver of the bakkie was simply giving her lift to town as the town is far and they never get an opportunity to go to town.The unidentified woman says &#8220;so Linda we are taking this video so that we can send it to people cause they are making the story ugly.&#8221;She further says that Linda must tell the viewers that she is the one who chose to sit in the cage at her own free will. She also asked her to tell the viewers why she chose to sit in the cage.&#8220;I sat in the cage because it was hot,&#8221; Linda explained.The picture which started circulating on social media caused an uproar over what some described as inhumane.We are nothing without each other. pic.twitter.com/mBee9ilYC1 #Stop Albino killing (@kuliroberts) January 19, 2017@ShakaSisulu @kuliroberts @Thando_ThabetheHow could one do this to another Human-being #HumanAbuseMustFall pic.twitter.com/kfFeUKQEI1 Bongiwe Boh Khumalo (@Bongie_kays) January 19, 2017@FelicityShiba @kuliroberts I wonder why a person would do something like this? I can&#8217;t even come up with an insult thats safe for twitter De Wet stydom (@dewet83) January 19, 2017The owner of the bakkie has come out stating that the lady asked for a lift and when he said she should sit in front, the lady refused and jumped on the back and climbed into the cage on her own free will.DA MP Makashule Gana was shocked after he saw the picture this morning and stated that the incident should have not happened under any circumstances .&#8220;This can&#8217;t be happening, it doesn&#8217;t matter the circumstances that might have lead to that situation arising. It should not be happening,&#8221; said Gana.&nbsp;-Bianca Makondo
