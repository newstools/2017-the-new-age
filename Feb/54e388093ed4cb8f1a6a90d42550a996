THE Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (NMMU) has offered a R50000 reward to anyone who can come forward with information about the recent petrol bomb attack on campus.Yesterday, the university called on the police to arrest the attackers and asked the National Prosecuting Authority to intervene.Sunday s bombing of the procurement building follows two arson attacks in November last year which are still under police investigation. As the process is under way to find the arsonists, the university has instituted a range of additional security measures around its premises, buildings, entrances and movement of people and vehicles, supported by a high level of surveillance, the institution said.The university however denies that the recent arson attack was about the #FeesMustFall campaign, saying it was an attempt by self-serving groups to create fear and insecurity, to ride on the back of genuine struggles for access faced by poor students.The attack has also been described as an attempt to foment populist demands for free higher education now in the full knowledge that the university, on its own, cannot provide free higher education.In a letter circulated to all university staff on Monday afternoon, vicechancellor Derrick Swartz said they should focus on carrying on with often difficult day to day tasks of teaching and learning, research and engagement, supporting student life and providing key services. We expect the Heher Commission on Higher Education report to be released towards the end of June and it is not clear what policy reforms will follow this.Until then, we only have the resources of the present system, based mainly on subsidies and fees, to work with and we must do so prudently and efficiently, Swartz said.Meanwhile, the university is holding an exhibition titled Point of Human Origin. The exhibition is based on the research undertaken through the South African coast palaeoclimate, palaeoenvironment, palaeoecology, and palaeoanthrolopology (SACP4) project, which is led by palaeoanthropologist Prof Curtis Marean, a world leader in his field, from the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University.SACP4 is funded by the National Science Foundation, the Templeton Foundation, and the Hyde Family Foundations (US). Marean is an honorary professor at NMMU.The exhibition, housed at NMMU s Exhibition and Archives Centre opened to the public yesterday, from 9am to 4pm on Mondays to Fridays. The exhibition will run until the end of the year.LONDEKA DLAMINI
