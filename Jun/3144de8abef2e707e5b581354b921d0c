A number of upcoming businesses in the Ditsobotla local municipality were registered on the provincial government s central supply database (CSD) during a recent villages, townships and small dorpies outreach programme.The programme targeted areas like Itsoseng, Coligny and Blydeville.Most of the businesses have been operating informally and had no chance to get business from government.However, all that has changed now and those registered can now operate their enterprises with the full rights of legally recognised entities.About 10 new businesses were registered while officials from the finance, economy and enterprise development department assisted several others on what is needed for them to be registered.One of those newly registered, Marumo Mathipe of Oratile-Marumo Trading, thanked the department for providing them with information such as CSD registration, tenders and annual returns.He said that for most of them, they did not know which doors to knock at when face with challenges. This shows the provincial government s commitment to improving the lives of the people by assisting business people with the opportunities available. We are honoured by the gesture, Mathipe said.Another beneficiary, John Tibane, said he had a business idea but he did not know where to start due to lack of information. Now the call is in me to fulfil my dream and formalise it to turn my life around for the better, he said.The outreach programme was part of the government s intervention of addressing the issues raised by community leaders during their engagements with political leadership from the provincial government.The focus was on empowering emerging and existing businesses with opportunities on entrepreneur development with the aim of growing the local economy.The outreach was conducted in partnership with the Small Enterprise Finance Agency, North West Development Agency, Small Enterprise Development Agency, National Development Agency, National Youth Development Agency and the Ditsobotla local municipality local economic development unit.In her address to business people, chief director for business regulations at the department, Onnicah Sithole, said the sessions served as part of government s initiatives of bringing services closer to the people and also to instil the culture of entrepreneurship among young people as the future leaders of this country. Through programmes such as these we will able to improve the socio-economic conditions of local people to participate in the mainstream economy. Our plan is to change the economic landscape of our villages, townships and small dorpies by establishing sustainable enterprises. We will only achieve these if we work together with relevant institutions in supporting enterprises in the spirit of saamtrek-saamwerk, Sithole said.Services rendered during the outreach programme included the registration of businesses, assistance with submission of annual returns, registration on the CSD, information on skills development, funding opportunities, access to markets and product development. The department intends to have another engagement in finalising outstanding enquiries. We call on the young people to come up with innovative ideas that will benefit and change the current status of Ditsobotla, Sithole said.ELFAS TORERAIelfast@thenewage.co.za
