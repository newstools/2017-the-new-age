Parliamentary spokesperson Moloto Mothapo has on Friday confirmed Parliament will start the process of establishing rule for the section 89(1) which deals with the removal of a President. Parliament also noted and agreed with the strong reservation and caution underscored by both the Chief Justice and the Deputy Chief Justice in the minority judgment regarding encroachment of the judiciary into the internal functioning of the national legislature. In a statement, he said Parliament notes the judgment of the Constitutional Court in a matter between the Economic Freedom Fighters and others and the Speaker of the National Assembly, in particular, that the court neither declared that the Speaker failed to hold the President accountable nor ordered her to establish an impeachment committee of the type described by the applicants. “In this regard, the Court has held the National Assembly collectively responsible for not meaningfully implementing Section 89 of the Constitution. “The Court has thus ordered that the Rules of the Assembly be amended without delay to comply with Section 237 of the Constitution, which instructs that all Constitutional obligations be performed diligently and without delay. The National Assembly Rules Committee had already initiated a process, as part of its overhaul of rules, to outline a procedure to be followed in implementing section 89 of the Constitution. “In this regard, Parliament will ensure finalisation of the Assembly’s rules, in line with the Court’s order,” the statement read. -TNA Reporter
