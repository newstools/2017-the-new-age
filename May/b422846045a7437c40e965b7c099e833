Mamelodi Sundowns will be looking to stay at the top of the Absa Premiership table when they face in form Bidvest Wits tonight at the Bidvest Stadium.The Brazilians will be looking to continue with their recent fine form when they square off against the Clever boys away from home. Sundowns have not conceded in their last five games, winning all matches and scored 11 goals.While Wits won three games in the last five games, drew one and lost one. Wits conceded two goals and scored eight goals. However, Pitso Mosimane s charges defeated Wits 2-0 in the first round of the league at the Loftus Stadium in Pretoria and they would be looking to repeat the same thing tonight. We want to beat Wits on Monday and we will go all out to achieve that, said Mosimane.On the other side, Wits will be coming to this encounter brimming with confidence following their last Friday s 2-0 win over struggling Highlands Park. For Gavin Hunt s men this game is more important as they want to keep their titles hope alive. Wits are two points behind Sundowns and a win will see them lead Downs by one point.But this will not be easy for the Students as Mosimane s side is determined to retain the title. Mosimane has conceded that his side needs to stay focused at this time as they are approaching the end of the league season with six games remaining.-Ntsako Mashaba
