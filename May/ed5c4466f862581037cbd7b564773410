Maritzburg United s Fadlu Davids may have ruled himself out for the head coach job on a full time basis, but the players have made their desire for him to stay clear.The modest coach, who has shown signs of a future top coach, said he has his sights set on completing his coaching badges. The Uefa B licence holder intends to obtain an A licence, which is the second highest coaching certificate available in Europe. Davids argues that if he were to accept the full-time job, he won t have time to attend to the lessons fully, which will require him to travel to Europe.But one player who feels Maritzburg need not to look any further to entrust someone with the task of leading the team on a full time basis next season, is club captain Kurt Leintjies. The industrious attacking midfielder said if it were up to him, Davids would be given the job. He has done well each time he was thrown in the deep end (following the abrupt departures of Ernst Middendorp and Roger de Sa).If Maritzburg was my club I ll make the decision definitely but there are people above me. All we have to do as players, we just need to do the job on the field, so whatever the club decides on what is happening with Fadlu s future the players just have to support him. Davids, who was deservedly named PSL coach of the month for April, will be looking to end the season on a high note.The Team of Choice occupy seventh spot with 37 points and are desperate to finish inside the top eight for the second time in their history.
