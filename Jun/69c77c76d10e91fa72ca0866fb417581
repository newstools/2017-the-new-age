A Johannesburg high court judge has ruled that public schools cannot promote any one religion and exclude others. It offends for a public school to promote or allow its staff to promote that it, as a public school, adheres to only one, or predominantly only one religion, to the exclusion of others; and to hold out that it promotes the interest of any one religion in favour of others, judge Willem van der Linde said in his ruling yesterday.The judgment came after an application brought by the Organisation for Religious Education and Democracy (OGOD) for the court to rule against having one dominant religion observed at public schools.OGOD brought the application against six schools Laerskool Randhart, Laerskool Baanbreker, Laerskool Garsfontein, Ho rskool Linden, Ho rskool Oudtshoorn and Oudtshoorn Gimnasium and was opposed by Solidarity which represented the schoolsThe court ruling reaffirmed the constitutional right of South Africans to practise their religion without any particular religion being given preference at public institutions.The Department of Basic Education (DBE) said the ruling was consistent with its policy informed by the South African Schools Act and the Constitution that no one religion should be promoted above another.DBE spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said the aim was not to ban religious practices in schools but about protecting children and emphasising that schools should engage in religious education rather than religious instruction. No change will take place as a result of this judgment and it will continue to be business as usual for DBE as the court merely reinforced our existing policy in terms of religion in schools. We will however study the judgment in detail. However, we remind school governing bodies however to review their rules to ensure that they are in compliance with legislation, Mhlanga said.The African Christian Democratic Party president Kenneth Meshoe, who has been calling for Christian values to remain in schools, said they were happy with the ruling.Solidarity s Juran van der Heever said they were still going to go through the whole judgment and will decide if they will appeal.NONDUMISO ZWANEnondumisoz@thenewage.co.za
