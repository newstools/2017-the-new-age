The provincial government is seeking to a long term solution to the escalating debt municipalities to owe Eskom, cooperative governance, human settlement and traditional affairs spokesperson Xhanti Teki has said.The power utility has pulled the plug on municipalities that have not honoured their payment plan to repay the millions they owe it.The department will be convening a meeting with different stakeholders in the coming weeks to take stock of the meetings s resolution with Eskom, Teki said.He said they have been hard at work talking to defaulting municipalities to resolve outstanding debt and proposed medium to long term solutions. The main hurdle is the negative cash flow projections, municipalities do not collect enough revenue. The municipalities are urged to avail a portion of the equitable share from the national fiscus to Eskom as a way to reduce both current and arrears accounts, he said.Teki also said the progress had been made in the debt as other municipalities had managed to sign agreements with Eskom.According to the department, Magareng, NamaKhoi, Emthanjeni, Tsantsabane, Dikgatlong, Siyancuma, Ka Garib and Siyathemba have made arrangements to avoid power cuts.Thembelihle, Ubuntu and Renosterberg have not yet entered intro any agreement because of the on going discussion. We are hopeful that soon they will reach an agreement and all stated role players will continue to give support through Eskom s debt provincial task team, he said.Teki said a comprehensive report would be drafted and presented to the premier, executive council, Eskom debt national task team and provincial South African local government association.Eskom earlier this week vowed to disconnect electricity to at least four municipalities in the province that owe them billions in unpaid electricity supply.Acting CEO of Eskom Matshela Koko said while this decision remains an agonising one for them, they take solace in the fact that they spared no effort. Eskom is in a uniquely invidious position, locked between a deteriorating financial position and running afoul of the public finance management act, he said.Meanwhile Koko said since the commencement of supply interruptions early this week, a number of municipalities have come forward with their payments and signed payment plans going forward.He said municipalities contributed to almost 42% of Eskom total sales and almost 41% of Eskom s revenue annually. We hope that impacted municipalities will honour their outstanding debt in the interest of the residents and businesses in the impacted areas, Koko said.He said they would be monitoring the adherence to the municipality s payment plans and payment of current accounts and that any defaults would result in the interruption of supply without further notice.TIISETSO MANOKOtiisetsom@thenewage.co.za
