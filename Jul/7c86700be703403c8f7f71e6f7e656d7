Free State provincial government has dissolved Metsimaholo council for its failure to approve the municipal budget for 2017/18.Premier s spokesperson Tiisetso Makhele said the municipality s failure was due to political difference, which led to MEC of Finance writing a letter to the executive mayor Sello Hlasa informing him of the consequence of the delay. Following the political issues that led to the failure of Metsimaholo Local Municipality to adopt its 2017/2018 budget, MEC for finance on the 6th of July wrote a letter to the Mayor informing him of the consequences of failure to adopt the budget, Makhele said.The ANC lost power of the municipality in the 2016 local municipal election, which saw the DA, Metsimaholo Community Association s (MCA) and EFF formed a coalition to form a government.A candidate from MCA, Sello Hlasa was elected mayor, while the DA managed to get both speakers position and the whip position.Meanwhile, the provincial executive council appointed Moses Moremi as the administrator.
