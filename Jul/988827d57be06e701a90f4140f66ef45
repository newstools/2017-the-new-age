These bills included the Expropriation Bill, Medical Innovation Bill, Broadcasting Amendment Bill and Traditional Courts Bill.Also the National Youth Development Agency Bill was passed on the eve of Youth Month this year that recognised the importance of creating opportunities that would empower South Africa s young people.Ramaphosa said that during this term, ministers and officials regularly interacted with committees to ensure a streamlined legislative process and to enable legislators scrutiny of executive actions.Various members of the executive including the ministers of Public Enterprises, Social Development and Finance gave account to committees on matters of national interest.Similarly, the president, deputy president, ministers and deputy ministers presented themselves to the National Assembly and National Council of Provinces to answer questions for oral reply, Ramaphosa said.Parliament also successfully debated issues of importance such as the increase in farm murders, the marking of the 20th anniversary of the Constitution and Human Rights Day, the scourge of violence against women and children and advancing youth economic empowerment.DENNIS CRUYWAGENnews@thenewage.co.za
