President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Sunday&#8217;s attack by an armed assailant who stormed a popular nightclub in Istanbul killing 39 people during New Year celebrations sought to create chaos in Turkey.&#8220;They are working to destroy our country&#8217;s morale and create chaos by deliberately targeting our nation&#8217;s peace and targeting civilians with these heinous attacks,&#8221; Erdogan said in a statement on the presidency website.&#8211;AFP
