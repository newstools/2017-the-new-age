President Jacob Zuma has called for tough action against principals and management teams of schools which performed dismally in the 2016 National Senior Certificate examinations.Addressing the basic education lekgotla in Centurion yesterday, Zuma said: There must be consequences for principals and school management teams who recorded a zero percent pass rate. We must not allow any room in the public service for ineptitude and incompetence. Everyone must strive for excellence, more so in education. I urge this meeting to pay special attention and develop concrete plans to attend to whatever problems exist in the underperforming districts, provinces and schools. Let us attend to shortcomings and ensure that we continue improving performance in education. There were 18 schools which had no pupils passing in last year s examinations. KwaZulu-Natal had the most number of schools with a 0% pass rate, 10, followed by Limpopo, four, and Eastern Cape, two.Zuma said it was inconceivable that pupils and teachers could spend the whole year in class and not manage to get a single pass at the end of it.He called on the department to look into the matter and ensure that it was rectified.Zuma said this year s lekgotla was in honour of Oliver Tambo, who embodied all that was good and noble about the teaching profession . We encourage all our teachers to honour, protect and advance the legacy of this outstanding teacher, president Oliver Tambo, he said.Meanwhile, University of South Africa s Prof Elias Mathipa said the key to the outcome of the education gathering should be finding ways of strengthening schools at grass roots level to ensure that teaching and learning can effectively take place in all schools, especially in the rural areas. The problems are at school level. If the department at national level fails to provide enough money for budgeting for the erection of schools, provision of books, equipment, schools will not teach effectively and pupils will fail to master the subjects, Mathipa said.LILLIAN SELAPISAlillians@thenewage.co.za
