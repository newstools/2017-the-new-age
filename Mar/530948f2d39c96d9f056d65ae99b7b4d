Safety and security in schools is among the issues at the top of the Department of Basic Education s agenda as these institutions of learning have become a soft target for criminals who vandalise and steal school property.Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga has expressed concern over the safety of pupils and staff in schools as brazen criminals have turned them into their playgrounds. We put in computers and they are stolen, our property is vandalised and our pupils are exposed to danger, Motshekga said.She said some of the problems of school safety included the location of schools, the adjacent land uses, size of schools, overcrowding, lack of effective physical security measures and poor maintenance of school facilities.The minister was speaking yesterday during a briefing on the outcomes of the Council of Education Ministers meeting in Pretoria recently. The council is made up of all nine provincial MECs, the minister and deputy minister. Previously there have been no clear, comprehensive and holistic guidelines that address these problems when planning, designing and implementing school infrastructure. The norms and standards for school infrastructure cover this but not comprehensively and do not cover any specifications. As a result of this gap there are huge inconsistencies and different approaches that are adopted by the sector, some of which do not yield any return on investment as the vandals just walk through the security measures that have been provided. Motshekga said some incidents of school vandalism, theft and violence could have been reduced and avoided had proper security measures been put in place. We want to make sure our children and teachers are safe in schools and our infrastructure and investments in education are adequately protected. In light of this, guidelines for addressing safety and security problems when planning and implementing school infrastructure projects have been developed and were approved by the council. The proposed school infrastructure safety and security guidelines will provide minimum measures to be considered by anyone who is designing and providing infrastructure projects in public schools across all infrastructure programmes.Motshekga also said there was a gap within the department to guide schools in dealing with pupil pregnancy since the withdrawal of the guidelines to prevent and manage learner pregnancy in schools, known as measures, in 2012.The measures were withdrawn because schools were found to misinterpret the clause on period of absence of the girl pupil from school after pregnancy and forced pupils to stay out of school for a period of up to two years.The 2015 Annual School Survey reported that an estimated 15740 young girls fell pregnant in the academic school year, with some girls being in primary school.LILLIAN SELAPISAlillians@thenewage.co.za
