It affects about one in every four million births worldwide.Children with this rare genetic condition mostly look healthy when they are born, but show signs of the condition during their first year, including a bigger head, larger eyes, a small lower jaw and hair loss of eyelashes and eyebrows.KUTULLO MADISHA
