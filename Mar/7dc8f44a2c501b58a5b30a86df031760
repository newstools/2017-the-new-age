Disney has indefinitely postponed the opening of its film &#8220;Beauty and the Beast&#8221; in Malaysia after censors in the Muslim-majority nation reportedly cut out a &#8220;gay moment&#8221; in the movie.The cuts came after the movie ran into trouble in Russia, which slapped an adults-only rating on the film last week following pressure by an ultra-conservative lawmaker who was pushing for a ban.The film&#8217;s director Bill Condon has revealed that it contains Disney&#8217;s &#8220;first exclusively gay moment&#8221;, although some critics have said the reference is extremely mild and fleeting.Malaysian Censorship Board (LPF) chairman Abdul Halim Abdul Hamid told The Star newspaper that the film &#8220;has been approved&#8230; with a minor cut&#8221;.The cut focussed on a &#8220;gay moment&#8221; in the film, said Abdul Halim, adding that it had been rated PG-13 &#8212; which indicates that some material may be inappropriate for pre-teens.The Malaysian release of the movie, featuring &#8220;Harry Potter&#8221; star Emma Watson, was postponed by Disney earlier this week pending &#8220;an internal review&#8221;, according to theatre chain Golden Screen Cinemas which was set to show the film from Thursday.Notices posted at the chain&#8217;s cinemas in Kuala Lumpur said the film&#8217;s release had been &#8220;postponed by Disney until further notice&#8221;.Disney&#8217;s office in Singapore was not immediately able to confirm the censorship decision or say when the film would be released.In a departure from previous depictions of the fairy tale, Le Fou, the sycophantic sidekick to antagonist Gaston, is portrayed by comedian Josh Gad as a gay man, making him Disney&#8217;s first ever out LGBT character.The film has also come under fire from religious figures in neighbouring Singapore, with Christian clergy attacking Disney for deviating from &#8220;wholesome, mainstream values&#8221;.&#8221;Parents are therefore strongly advised to provide guidance to their children about this re-make of &#8216;Beauty &amp; the Beast&#8217;,&#8221; said Bishop Rennis Ponniah, president of the National Council of Churches of Singapore.Harussani Zakaria, the senior mufti for Malaysia&#8217;s northern Perak state, said the film would &#8220;sow the seeds of destruction and negative behaviour in our society&#8221;.&#8221;We must guard ourselves from Western behaviour which has gone astray,&#8221; he told AFP.&#8221;This movie must be banned in Malaysia.&#8221;The Malaysian Muslim People Coalition NGO also called for a ban, with its president Amsah Hamzah saying the film would &#8220;promote negative values&#8221;.&#8221;Youngsters can easily become excited by the gay behaviour seen in the movie and could be influenced by it,&#8221; Amsah said.But Malaysia&#8217;s minister of tourism and culture, Seri Nazri Aziz, has criticised the controversy over the film, calling it &#8220;ridiculous&#8221;.&#8221;You don&#8217;t ban a film because of a gay character,&#8221; he told the Malay Mail Online. &#8220;We must allow people to decide for themselves.&#8221;Homosexuality is illegal in Malaysia, where laws criminalising sodomy can result in imprisonment, corporal punishment and fines.-AFP
