UNSETTLED Tshepo Masilela holds the key to his future at Kaizer Chiefs, according to his agent Mike Makaab. The trusted but injury-prone defender is five months away from having his contract with Chiefs expire. The 32-year-old former Bafana Bafana man has not been a regular under coach Steve Komphela in the first round that saw Chiefs struggling. Komphela preferred to use Sibusiso Khumalo in the left back slot. Makaab said he will have a meeting with Masilela to map the way forward. It will all boil down to what he wishes at this stage of his career. Another defender whose playing future is uncertain is Kgotso Moleko. It is understood talks for a contract extension are yet to begin and former mentor Stuart Baxter, now with SuperSport United, is monitoring the situation with keen interest.The other Chiefs player linked with a reunion with Baxter is Willard Katsande. The Zimbabwe captain is yet to engage with Chiefs over a contract extension. His deal runs out in June. Makaab added that defender Lorenzo Gordinho had extended his stay at Naturena for three years. Gordinho recently underwent trials at Danish side Aalborg but was unsuccessful.news@thenewage.co.za-Linda Ximba
