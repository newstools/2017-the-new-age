The Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga expressed shock at the brutal murder of a Laduma High School&#8217;s Acting Principal Priscilla Mchunu.Mchunu was reportedly conducting Saturday classes at the school with a group of learners when two gunmen entered the school and shot the Acting Principal multiple times in front of her learners.The Minister sends her deepest condolences to the family of Laduma High School Acting Principal, Priscilla Mchunu and the entire school community for their tragic loss. This is an absolutely barbaric act which has shocked all of us in the education sector. The brutal murder of one of our dedicated educators in front of school children is completely inhumane. All of these learners will have to go for counselling after what they have witnessed,&#8221; the minister said from Dubai where she is representing South Africa at a UNESCO meeting.&#8220;My thoughts and prayers are with the family of Ms Mchunu at this time and with all of those at Laduma High School who have lost one of their own in such a traumatic manner, said Minister Motshekga.&#8220;Ms Mchunu was clearly a hardworking and devoted educator who gave up her weekends to help learners who were struggling to prepare for their examinations. Her murder is a huge loss to the education sector.&#8221;The motive for the murder is still unclear, however, the Minister is urging police to track down those responsible as they are clearly extremely dangerous criminals who need to be removed from society as a matter of urgency.&#8211;TNA Reporter
