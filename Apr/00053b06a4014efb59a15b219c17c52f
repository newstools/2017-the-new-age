The shortage of water is expected to be a thing of the past in Carolina and neighbouring areas following the construction of a bulk water pipeline by the Department of Water and Sanitation.Carolina is located in the Chief Albert Luthuli local municipality, under the Gert Sibande district municipality.The assurance about the resolution of poor water supply in the municipality was made by the Minister of Water and Sanitation Nomvula Mokonyane when she presided over a sod turning ceremony for the second phase of the pipeline s construction on Friday.Mokonyane said the bulk water supply project was part of the build-up to service delivery in achieving the standard of the National Development Plan (NDP) and Vision 2030.She said the completion of the project will cost more than R90m and will benefit a large number of communities including Bettysgoed, Smithfield, Oshoek, Lochiel, Robinsdale, Aankomst, Pampoen, Houtbosch and Hartbeeskop. All the work is meant to develop the lives of women, girls and the youth, particularly the Africans who were always at the tail-end of the services value chain. We are here to ensure this bulk supply project really is off the ground because it is vital for the socio-economic progress of at least 16 000 people in the vicinity. It is a scheme that is also cognisant of all kinds of growth, including economic and population, Mokonyane said.She further called on the residents to ensure they were always conserving water since the country experienced the challenge of water supply as a result of drought. The availability of water must also impact upon better sanitation solutions. It is essential to recognise that the infrastructure in place is meant to service all members of the community. Each member of the community has an equal responsibility to protect all water and sanitation infrastructure, together with all other infrastructure that supports communities, Mokonyane said.A few years ago, poor water supply saw the Chief Albert Luthuli local municipality being taken to the North Gauteng High Court by civil society groups and other stakeholders.This occurred after several violent protests were staged by the residents as they voiced their anger for remaining without water for almost a year after acid mine drainage from the local mines contaminated the main water supplier, Boesmanspruit Dam.The court ordered the municipality to supply the residents with clean water within a period of the three days after it was discovered that the water supply was contaminated by acid mine water seepage.FRANCE NYAKAfrancen@thenewage.co.za
