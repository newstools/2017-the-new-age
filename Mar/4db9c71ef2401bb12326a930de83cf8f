Citibank has joined Absa and Barclays in providing evidence to the Competition Commission regarding the collusion of 17 banks to manipulate the rand.The commission found that from at least 2007, Citibank and its competitors had a general agreement to collude on prices for bids, offers and bid-offer spreads for spot trades in relation to currency trading involving US dollar/ rand currency pairing. The commission found that the banks manipulated the price of bids and offers through agreements to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times.Banks implicated include Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas, JP Morgan Chase, JP Chase Bank, Investec, Standard New York Securities, Standard Chartered Bank, HSBC Bank, Credit Suisse Group, Standard Bank of SA, Commerzbank AG, Australia and New Zealand banking group, Nomura international, Macquaerie Bank, Absa Bank, Barclays Capital and Barclays Bank.The Competition Tribunal held a hearing in Pretoria yesterday to determine the validity of the terms of Citibank s settlement agreement with the commission. The commission had determined that Citibank should pay a fine of R69m, an amount less than 10% of the company s turnover (which is usually the benchmark for such fines).Citibank undertook to cooperate with the commission and avail witnesses to help in the prosecution of the other banks that colluded. The commission s head of the cartel division, Makgale Mohlala, said Citibank had decided to not disclose the percentage of turnover to which the R69m fine amounted. However, he said that the fine, despite being less than 10% of Citi s annual turnover, was justified because it was a means of incentivising the bank in providing substantial evidence to prosecute the other banks.Commissioner Tembinkosi Bonakele said that the settlement with Citibank was to encourage speedy settlement and full disclosure to strengthen the prosecution case against the other banks. He said that many of the banks involved are misleading the public in denying their involvement in the cartel, whereas in tribunal hearings they sing a different tune. The other banks are not cooperating but Citibank has already presented us with evidence on the cartel and how they manipulated the rand and to what effect, he said. Mohlala said the commission is proceeding with prosecutions of other banks as they have denied their involvement in the cartel. They refused to cooperate, therefore we are proceeding with Citibank, Absa and Barclays as our key witnesses to help bring the case to fruition. We are ready to take them on, he said.-THELMA NGOMA|thelman@thenewage.co.za
