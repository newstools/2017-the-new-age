Soulja Boy has dropped a new track taking aim squarely at his rival Chris Brown.In &#8220;Hit &#8216;Em with the Draco,&#8221; the rapper throws down the gauntlet with lyrics like &#8220;You know I&#8217;m gonna knock Chris Brown down when I see him,&#8221; in reference to an upcoming celebrity boxing match.Soulja Boy is reportedly being trained by former world champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. for the fight, while Brown will be trained by Mike Tyson, says NME.com.In the track, the rapper also calls out 50 Cent, who has publicly thrown his support behind Brown for the match.&#8220;Ayy 50 Cent what you talking about?,&#8221; he starts.&#8220;You made all that money off Vitamin Water and then filed for bankruptcy.&#8221;And in another tit for tat twist, Tyson has apparently also hit the studio to record a diss track of his own against Soulja Boy.The public feud began earlier this month when Soulja Boy liked an Instagram photo of Brown&#8217;s ex-girlfriend model-actress Karrueche Tran.&nbsp;-Relaxnews
