The fact that Kaizer Chiefs finished the last two seasons empty handed is still in the minds of the players and the only way to end this is to win a piece of silverware in the new campaign.With the new season set to get under way next month, Chiefs players will be under huge pressure to end their cup drought. Goalkeeper and captain Itumeleng Khune has challenged his teammates to step up to the plate as the club could not afford to go another season without winning silverware. He said coach Steve Komphela cannot take the blame alone. We re all in the same boat. We all have to shoulder the blame because we, the players on the field aren t delivering. It s about time that we step up and make our fans happy. The past two seasons haven t been our seasons at all. We are looking forward to this season to reclaim our glory. The only way Khune feels they can achieve that is to change their attitude in the games they play. They lost their concentration in matches leading up to the end of the season which cost them the Absa Premiership title as they dropped 18 points in the process, he said. The only way to turn things around is to perform to the best of our abilities. The coaches prepare us well but we too often lose concentration in the last minute of the game. Khune said. Two seasons without a trophy has been a bitter pill to swallow. This hasn t happened before in my time with the club. Chiefs will be looking to set the tone for the new season by claiming the Black Label Carling Cup trophy when they meet rivals Orlando Pirates at FNB Stadium on Saturday. This game is very important, every time we play Pirates there is pride at stake. Our fans want a win and it is important for us as a team and as players to deliver on the day. That s what our fans expect and that s what we also want as a team, to see how far are we with the preparations ahead of the new season. -NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@ thenewage.co.za
