The province has joined forces with five other provinces to root out corruption and irregularities in the processing and issuing of driving licences and vehicle roadworthy certificates at testing stations following the rise in the number of road fatalities over the festive season period.The interprovincial task team (IPTT) which includes Mpumalanga, Limpopo, Eastern Cape, Free State and Gauteng will meet on Friday to discuss ways of improving road safety in the country and how to eradicate corrupt and illegal methods of obtaining driving licences.This after road fatalities over the festive season rose by 5%, reaching a total of 1714 fatalities. The province had the highest number of road deaths closely followed by Limpopo which both form part of the IPTT.Transport Minister Dipuo Peters subsequently announced tough measures to ensure that drivers adhere to traffic regulations and that all drivers on the country s roads have proper, legitimate and legal driving documents.Public transport regulation and law enforcement sub-committee chairperson Sifundiswa Lunga said the IPTT welcomed and fully backed the stance outlined by Peters on the issue of road safety. The tough stance adopted by Peters is welcomed and supported by all those of us who seek and work towards the reduction of the road fatalities, Lunga said. In fact, as the IPTT we have for long now been jointly cooperating in ensuring adherence to road/traffic regulation and to have co-ordinated law enforcement initiative with these participating provinces. The IPTT chairperson, Crosby Themba Mavundla, said they also welcomed the tough stance by Peters on road safety and committed to working together to eradicate corrupt and illegal methods of obtaining driving licences.Other measures announced by Peters to curb road fatalities included continued engagement and finalisation with the Department of Justice the introduction on minimum sentences for negligent and reckless drivers and the reclassification of drunken driving from schedule 3 which is less severe, to schedule 5 which is a tougher offence. Our joint festive operations indicate to us that our provinces are making significant progress in dealing with lawlessness on the roads, including dealing with unroadworthy vehicles, reduction of accidents and general conflicts in our communities. Our message is clear that safety, both on our roads and in our communities, is a collective responsibility for all of us, Lunga said.The first meeting of IPTT, where the issue of corruption and other related issues will be discussed, will take place in Polokwane, Limpopo tomorrow and Friday.SIBONGISENI MAPHUMULOprovinces@thenewage.co.za
