French President Francois Hollande warmly greeted Emmanuel Macron on Monday in their first public meeting since the centrist&#8217;s resounding election victory the day before.Hollande smiled and clasped the arms of his one-time economy minister as the two men attended a ceremony at Paris&#8217;s Arc de Triomphe to commemorate victory over the Nazis in World War II.The president walked beside the 39-year-old Macron to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the monument, where they laid a wreath.Hollande plucked Macron from obscurity three years ago when he named the former investment banker his economy minister, marking the start of his meteoric rise to Sunday&#8217;s electoral victory over far-right leader Marine Le Pen.Final results from the interior ministry out Monday showed Macron &#8212; who will be France&#8217;s youngest ever president &#8212; won 66.1 percent of the vote against 33.9 percent for Le Pen.-AFP
