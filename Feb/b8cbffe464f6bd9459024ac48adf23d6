Sixty thousand South Africans are to take part in the country s fifth SA HIV, Prevalence, Incidence, Behaviour and Communication survey.People have been encouraged to open their homes to field workers who will do the survey and take a blood sample from randomly preselected households.The study is aimed at determining if participants are taking their ARV treatment correctly, assessing the level of resistance to ARV by those on treatment and identifying the prevalence of social factors that expose people to the risk of contracting HIV among others.The survey done every five years, was launched yesterday at the Nelson Mandela Foundation in Johannesburg Participation in the survey is voluntary and it is important for as many people who are approached to take part for the results to be representative of the country, Prof Leickness Simbayi, deputy CEO for research at the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) and principal investigator of the study said. A month into the study, more than 1000 households have agreed to participate. By the end of the study about 2000 households are expected to have taken part. Field workers have noted challenges on gaining access to some households in certain neighbourhoods particularly the suburban areas. The study is expected to take nine months. With seven months to go, I would like to appeal to the preselected households to offer their full cooperation ensuring they respond honestly on their health behaviour. The results will have significant implications for the country s future health policy and in determining the appropriate response mechanisms to address our health challenges. South Africa has a high rate of HIV, with an estimated 7 million living with HIV, more than 3 million of those are on ARVs.The number is expected to increase owing to the government s new test and treat policy as per the guidelines of the World Health Organisation.LERATO DIALEleratod@thenewage.co.za&nbsp;
