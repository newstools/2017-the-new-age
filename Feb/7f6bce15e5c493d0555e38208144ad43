Economic participation, partnerships and the mobilisation of all of South Africa s capacities would build transformation and not conquest, conflict or extortion.This was the thrust of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan s budget speech delivered in Parliament yesterday. It is a transformation that must unite, he said.Economic growth, jobs, investor confidence and avoiding a sovereign ratings downgrade, mixed in with pro-poor elements and higher taxes for the wealthy were the hallmarks of a well-balanced speech.He projected that economic growth would rise from 0.5% in 2016 to 1.3% in 2017.In the past, he said, the budget provided extensive details of developments in the economy. But there is a larger purpose, a moral vision and intent behind these plans and programmes. We need to build a new national consensus and a new commitment to deliver, focused on the triple challenges of poverty, unemployment and inequality, he said. The Constitution required that all who lived in South Africa should have access to housing, medical care, social security, water and education.There should also be a progressive realisation of access to tertiary education and other elements in a comprehensive set of social entitlements. Wealth and economic opportunities had to be equitably shared, he said.Gordhan reminded South Africans that about two-thirds of the budget about R1 trillion out of R1.5 trillion total expenditure is used for social rights such as education, healthcare, social security, housing and water and sanitation.The budget deficit for 2017-18 is forecast to be 3.1% of GDP, the same as October s forecast, but set to reduce to 2.6 % over the medium term.Government debt remains a concern, with the fastest growing item being debt service costs set to be a painful R169bn for 2017-18 (up from October s forecast of R147bn).Kenneth Creamer, economist at Wits University, said the Treasury should be praised for striking the correct fiscal balance in this year s budget. Gordhan understands that fiscal rectitude is necessary for growth and transformation. To maintain the fiscal balance, the minister will contain government spending and will raise taxes for the well off, he said.Higher taxes, combined with expenditure cuts, will help narrow the budget deficit to 2.6% of GDP by 2019-20 from 3.4%.-DENNIS CRUYWAGEN and Bernard Sathekge
