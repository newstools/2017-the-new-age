Parliaments ad hoc committee looking into the SABC board was on Friday told that journalist and senior producer at SABC Radio Suna Venter was shot in the face with a pellet gun in November.Dear all, the shooting incident reported this week occurred in January 2017, not November 2016. My own typo in letter to CP. #SABCinquiry Suna Venter (@sunav) January 27, 2017Democratic Alliance (DA) MP Phumzile Van Damme on Friday told the committee that the incident occurred after she submitted her written submission to Parliament.Venter is one of the SABC 8 journalists who were fired after they objected to the SABC&#8217;s editorial policy to not broadcast violent protests.According to an email sent to Van Damme, by Venter on Monday, she had surgery to remove objects in her face.&#8220;Dr Mark Phipson at the Sandton Medi-Clinic operated and removed two foreign objects identified by the police as pellets from an air pistol,&#8221; reads the note.The #SABC8 continue to be intimidated. Attacked immediately after written submission to Parly. NPC &amp; Minister must be summoned to Parly! pic.twitter.com/tRh5cxOmnD Phumzile Van Damme (@zilevandamme) January 27, 2017The Commitee is now set to ask Police Minister Nathi Nhleko what is being done to protect journalists at the broadcaster.Speculation over who shot Suna, someone mentions that Hlaudi has 10 body guards. #sabcinquiry #sabc Chelsea Lotz (@Chelsea_Lotz) January 27, 2017Last year the SABC Inquiry was told that a number of the SABC 8 journalists had been subjected to intimidation including receiving death threats.The DA indicated it would request from the South African Police Service that the SABC 8 be given police protection.Last year the Labour Court ruled that the dismissal of four of the SABC 8, including Venter, was unlawful and should be reversed.-TNA Reporter
