The story of Umkhonto we Sizwe fighter Makhosi Nyoka, who became a victim of the 1988 Piet Retief ambush by notorious Vlakplaas operative Eugene de Kock seems to be totally forgotten.Nyoka, comes from KwaMashu a township that was home to prominent freedom fighters such as Jeff Radebe, Dumisani Makhaye and Sam Kikine.Yet it seems the name of the MK cadre, who was described as brave and smart by those who worked closely with her, doesn t seem to feature among the list of heroes and heroines of the struggle.We spoke to Neli Nyoka, Makhosi s sister who described her as a street smart and brave freedom fighter who left the country because she wanted to see a free South Africa.In the early 80s, Makhosi left the country and settled in Swaziland on the instructions of the ANC after news came out that the apartheid government planned to kill MK operatives involved in the bombing of the Pietermaritzburg High Court in 1983.After undergoing military training in Angola, Nyoka returned to the frontline state of Swaziland where she was responsible for creating safe passage for MK fighters coming back to fight inside South Africa. She was also responsible for smuggling guns into the then Natal province via the Ngwavuma passage.However, in June 1988, she together with well-known Nokuthula Simelane were ambushed and killed in Piet Retief.It later transpired that they were sold out by one of their commanders who instructed them to re-enter the country via the then Transvaal province after tipping off the apartheid police killers about their mission. On that day we suffered as De Kock and his squad came here and sprayed us with teargas demanding to know who told us that Makhosi had been killed. They also tortured us by showing us pictures of the car Makhosi and her comrade were in riddled with bullets and stained with blood, a teary Neli said.The Nyoka family want to see a statue of Makhosi with her biography erected in the ward so that the public will know what she had done and what she had sacrificed for her country. Some know who Makhosi is while others have no idea. So we would be glad to have a museum with a statue where people can learn more about her and how she contributed in this freedom we have today. The bid comes as the local branch of the South African Communist Party is pushing for the renaming of the local Nkanyisweni community hall to Makhosi Nyoka.Speaking at a memorial lecture a week ago, Bulelani Duma, an ex Robben Island prisoner who trained Makhosi said: Makhosi was so fearless she once asked us to spray paint the walls of the vicious Inkatha stronghold of KwaMashu Hostel.During her training in Angola, she excelled in military tactics, firearms handling and military combat work, which put more emphasis in military intelligence. She had a special interest in political science and asked me to conduct political classes for local students, Duma said.Themba Ntuli, a former MK soldier who trained Makhosi said she was a brave female fighter who died because she and her four comrades were sold out.SIHLE MAVUSOsihlem@thenewage.co.za
