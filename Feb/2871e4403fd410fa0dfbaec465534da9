Dustin Johnson edged closer to golf&#8217;s world number one ranking Saturday, firing a five-under par 66 to seize a one-stroke lead after two rounds of the weather-hit Genesis Open.The US Open champion, who could jump from number three in the world to number one with a long sought victory at Riviera Country Club, had a 36-hole total of 10-under par 132.He was one shot in front of US compatriots Pat Perez, who closed with back-to-back birdies for a 66, and Cameron Tringale, who had seven birdies in an impressive seven-under 64.It was a further two strokes back to Venezuela&#8217;s Jhonattan Vegas and Americans Patrick Rodgers and J.T. Poston on 135.Johnson, whose six top-10 finishes at Riviera include a playoff loss two years ago, could supplant Jason Day atop the world rankings if he can break through for a first win at the classic course west of Los Angeles.&#8220;I want to put myself in position to win this golf tournament, that&#8217;s really all I care about is what it takes to get it done here,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;The rest of the stuff, the points and world golf rankings, yeah, I would like to get there, but I&#8217;m not worried about it.&#8221;If Johnson wins, Day must finish no worse than a two-way tie for third to hold on to the top spot.The Australian was eight off the pace after completing his rain-disrupted second round early Saturday.Day was among the players forced off the course when wind and heavy rain swept through on Friday &#8212; when Johnson never made it to the first tee.Day said the disruptions were less of a problem than his own &#8220;scratchy&#8221; game.&#8220;I didn&#8217;t hit it good,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When you&#8217;re thinking too much technique you&#8217;re losing focus of actually the target &#8212; I&#8217;m getting in my own way, really.&#8221;The third round began shortly after the second ended, but darkness fell before the leaders teed off, and Sunday was shaping up as a marathon.A confident Johnson was undaunted by the prospect.&#8220;Thirty-six holes can be a really good thing sometimes if you&#8217;re playing really well, which I feel like the golf game, I&#8217;m in control of it right now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So playing 36 in one day is not going to be a problem.&#8221;&#8211; Good touch on greens &#8211;Johnson had five birdies, rolling in putts of more than 30 feet at the fourth and 15th, and draining a 20-footer at the 18th.&#8220;I definitely rolled the putter good,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m feeling really comfortable over it. I&#8217;m seeing the lines really well and I feel like I&#8217;ve got a pretty good touch on the greens right now.&#8221;Eighteen players were within five strokes of Johnson&#8217;s lead. That included two-time major winner Jordan Spieth, who headlined a group on five-under 137.Those missing the cut at even par included Japan&#8217;s world number five Hideki Matsuyama &#8212; who also had a chance to overtake Day with a victory this week. He imploded in the adverse conditions on Friday and couldn&#8217;t get back on track as he closed out a nine-over par second round on Saturday.-AFP
