TWO men accused of assaulting and forcing Rethabile Victor Mlotshwa into a coffin have claimed that he had threatened to kill their wives.Yesterday, accused Willem Oosthuizen and Theo Martins Jackson pleaded not guilty to all charges against them in the high court sitting in the Delmas Magistrate s Court.Both accused are facing charges of attempted murder, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, kidnapping, intimidation and possession of an illegal firearm.They were granted R1000 bail each earlier this month. The accused told the court that they did not mean to harm to Mlotshwa but wanted to teach him a lesson.In a statement, Oosthuizen said it was after the threats that they decided not to go to the police but rather scare him. Oosthuizen said that he had no intention of killing Mlotshwa or any other person. He further denied having a firearm or assaulting the victim.The state called its first witness, Hannes de Beer, who is an employer of Jackson. He said he was pained when he heard about what happened to Mlotshwa.He explained that the incident occurred when he was out of the country and saw it in newspapers and on social media. The court previously heard how Mlotshwa was assaulted, kicked and forced into a coffin.The court heard that Mlotshwa s hands were tied to the vehicle s tow bar as the two farmers drove off with him.The victim was then taken to a chicken farm where he was threatened by Oosthuizen not to try to escape or he would be shot. He was allegedly assaulted with a knobkerrie as they forced him into the coffin and hit him all over the body.The accused also threatened to pour petrol on Mlotshwa and set him alight and put a snake in a coffin with him as he cried and pleaded.A harrowing video of the two farmers assaulting Mlotshwa went viral on social media last year, causing an outrage debate on racism.The video showed two white farmers, Oosthuizen and Jackson, beating up Mlotshwa and forcing him into the coffin. The court was adjourned until today and the trial has been moved to Middelburg for the interests of justice.DIKELEDI RAMABOPA dikeledir@thenewage.co.za
