Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage said he had not been contacted by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and dismissed a report that he was a &#8220;person of interest&#8221; in an FBI probe into possible collusion between Russia and Donald Trump&#8217;s presidential campaign.&#8220;No, of course they haven&#8217;t,&#8221; Farage, the former leader of Britain&#8217;s UK Independence Party, told BBC radio on Saturday when he was asked if the FBI had been in touch with him. &#8220;I mean this is just hysteria.&#8221;The Guardian, a British newspaper, said on Thursday that Farage had not been accused of wrongdoing and was not a suspect or a target of the U.S. investigation. But it said he was &#8220;right in the middle&#8221; of the relationships being looked at.U.S. officials have previously said they were unaware of any serious FBI interest in Farage.-Reuters
