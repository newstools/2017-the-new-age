Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has on Tuesday assured the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) that the personal details of grant beneficiaries will remain the property of government and not any private company.Gordhan, who was appearing before Scopa in order to provide clarity with regard to the ongoing Sassa and CPS debacle, made the comments in response to ANC MP Mnyamezeli Booi&#8217;s concerns regarding security around payment of Sassa grants.&#8220;Can you tell us where the data of our people lie because SASSA has told us they do not have control over it, so who has control over it?&#8220;Whoever has access to recipient details can control the 2019 elections,&#8221; cautioned Booi.Gordhan confirmed that the information of recipients remains the property of government and not any private company.&#8220;Treasury would be equally concerned if the information and data about 17 million recipients was not in government&#8217;s hands,&#8221; said Gordhan.During the meeting, Treasury Director-General Lungisa Fuzile clarified to Scopa that Treasury&#8217;s involvement was not because there was a lack of funds to pay social grants.According to Fuzile, a perception had emerged that there was not enough funds to pay the social grants.&#8220;We must clarify that Treasury is involved due to a lack of contract not that grants or service provider can&#8217;t be paid,&#8221; said Fuzile.Earlier in the meeting the Fiance Minister said that over R151bn has been allocated towards the payment of social grants for the 2017/18 financial year.With19 days to go, social grants to more than 17 million recipients hangs in the balance following SASSA&#8217;s failure to come up with an alternative to the unlawful contract with CPS.Earlier on Tuesday Gordhan told Scopa that he was confident that social grants will be paid on 1 April.However a contract has yet to be formally signed between CPS and Sassa. The initial contract between Sassa and CPS was declared unlawful by the Constitutional Court back in 2014.A ministerial task team led by Minister Jeff Radebe on Monday, decided that current negotiations with CPS should be terminated and that fresh negotiations should be started .Treasury has declined to sign off on a new contract with CPS saying it would not support the invalid extension of the CPS contract, unless the ConCourt agreed.Gordhan on Tuesday added that Treasury was now considering the Department of Social Development&#8217;s application for deviation to stick with CPS as a matter of urgency.According to an affidavit filed to the Constitutional Court on Monday by Sassa, &#8220;If the National Treasury approves the deviation for any resulting interim contract, the contract will comply with the applicable legislation.&#8221;-TNA Reporter
