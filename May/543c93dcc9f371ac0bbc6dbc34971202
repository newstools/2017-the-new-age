The sacking of 11 employees from the department of social development, accused of foster care grant fraud worth R19m at the Lower Umfolozi Service Office in Empangeni has been hailed a victory by community members.Social development MEC Weziwe Thusi said the arrests followed months of investigations that saw the suspension of 20 social workers and the temporary closure of the offices.In March, the MEC put 35 staff members, including 29 social workers, on leave when the fraud cases came to light.The department picked up the fraudulent activity when 169 foster care grants of R830 a month were renewed at the offices without authorisation from Sassa.This led to the department freezing 1376 grant payments while other social workers were called in to verify that the recipients did indeed qualify for the assistance.An affected community member, who wished to remain anonymous, said her family had suffered at the hands of the employees. When the grant was frozen we had to wait for months to go through the verification process so it could bereinstated, the community member said. With the family relying heavily on the social grant, there was little the family could do but to wait for the department to finish its investigations. It was not everyone who was involved in the fraud yet we all suffered due to the greed of a few individuals. I am glad they have been given their marching orders. They stole from the needy for no other reason but greed, she said.Thusi said the Lower Umfolozi office was not the only one to come under scrutiny from the department.Five other offices were investigated to destabilise the syndicate , with the intent of saving the department R11m a year. Out of the 17 officials who were charged with misconduct, 11 have been dismissed and three have been suspended for three months without pay. We are working with law enforcement agencies to ensure criminal charges are also preferred against those involved. Similar investigations are under way in five other service offices, Thusi said.During the investigation, social workers were deployed to schools to verify the existence of the children cited in the monthly grants.The department worked alongside the departments of justice and home affairs on the investigation to determine the origin of birth certificates and who approved the grants in court.Some of the suspended employees are expected to appear in the Durban Commercial Crimes Court soon.The department said they were continuing with investigations.SIBONGISENI MAPHUMULOsibongisenim@thenewage.co.za
