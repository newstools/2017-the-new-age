Football fans in Cape Town will be holding their breath hoping they don t suffer the ignominy of losing two teams to the third-tier come end of the National First Division season.As things stand Santos are bottom of the log and their sorry situation was exacerbated by a 2-0 loss to log leaders Thanda Royal Zulu at the weekend in Richards Bay. While the win saw Roger Sikhakhane s Thanda open a 10 point gap over second placed Black Leopards. The loss for The People s Team leaves them with 18 points from 22 matches.Santos neighbours, equally struggling Milano United, have reacted by sacking veteran coach Boebie Solomons. This after they were walloped 5-1 by rookies Real Kings in Durban. Milano, who shipped in six goals against AmaZulu this season, occupy 14th place and are in danger of relegation. They have 20 points from 22 games and have installed Douglas Williams and Byrone Hendricks to oversee the remaining eight matches.Cape Town All Stars, 12th on the log and FC Cape Town, who occupy 13th spot, cannot afford to relax as the curtain draws to a close. Meanwhile, Thanda coach Roger Sikhakhane says they will not start celebrating despite stretching their lead at the top of the log. We have to win our games and not be concentrating on other teams that are behind us. We are not worried about Leopards and whoever else is behind us.We ve been sitting there for nine months now so we are able to maintain that position, Sikhakhane said. With the NFD matches making way for the Nedbank Cup last 16 this weekend, fourth placed Royal Eagles and sixth-placed AmaZulu will have ample time to reflect on their contrasting fortunes.-Linda Ximba|news@thenewage.co.za
