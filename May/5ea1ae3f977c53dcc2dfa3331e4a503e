STUART Baxter returned to duty as he guided SuperSport United against Bloemfontein Celtic last night, still with a cloud of uncertainty over his future. Baxter was supposed to be unveiled as the new Bafana Bafana coach this week, but it looks unlikely Safa will make the announcement just yet.It is believed the two parties are still haggling over contractual terms, with SuperSport United holding out for a huge buyout price for their coach. Then there is apparently some disagreement between Baxter and Safa over other matters that are holding things up.Pressure has been mounting on the football federation to appoint a replacement for former coach Shakes Mashaba, who was sacked in December and the lack of positive developments on the matter hasn t inspired the public s faith in the football governing body are holding things up.Pressure has been mounting on the football federation to appoint a replacement for former coach Shakes Mashaba, who was sacked in December and the lack of positive developments on the matter hasn t inspired the public s faith in the football governing body Following a thorough, but lengthy process of seeking a replacement head coach for the men s senior national team, Bafana Bafana, the Association is pleased to announce that it has finalised an agreement with the successful candidate and is in the process of formalising the legal arrangements by exchanging signatures today, Safa CEO Dennis Mumble, said. We are mindful that the South African public has been waiting with bated breath for this matter to be concluded and we can report that we will make a formal and more detailed announcement to this effect in the next 24 to 48 hours. Bafana legend Benni McCarthy, who is part of the committee tasked with finding a coach, could not shed light on the delay. I don t know what s stalling the procedure to appoint the coach because they (Safa) have short listed pretty good candidates for the job, McCarthy said. I thought I was part of a group that was doing good to find the new coach for Bafana but I simply just don t know what has happened. By now, I was expecting that we ll be having a new head coach, but obviously the president, Danny Jordaan and the NEC knows exactly what they are doing.kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za-Kgomotso Sethusha
