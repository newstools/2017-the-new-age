British American Tobacco said Thursday that its 2016 profits were boosted by a pre-Brexit decline in the pound, as the group awaits completion of its takeover of US peer Reynolds.Net profit rose eight percent to 4.85 billion ($6.0 billion, 5.7 billion euros) last year, BAT said in an earnings release.Group revenue climbed almost 13 percent to 14.75 billion, helped by &#8220;weakness of sterling,&#8221; BAT said.With the maker of Lucky Strike cigarettes making vast sums from sales denominated in euros and dollars, BAT&#8217;s profits are inflated once converted into sterling.The results update comes one month after BAT agreed to pay almost $50 billion (47 billion euros) for control of Reynolds American in a move that targets the lucrative United States market and the fast-growing e-cigarette sector.&#8220;I am very pleased that we reached an agreement&#8230; in relation to the acquisition of the remaining 57.8 percent of Reynolds American that the group does not currently own,&#8221; BAT chief executive Nicandro Durante said.&#8220;This is a significant step towards the completion of this transaction and we look forward to putting the recommended offer to shareholders.&#8221;Shares in BAT, whose cigarette brands include also Dunhill and Kent, rose 0.4 percent to stand at 50.18 in midday deals on London&#8217;s FTSE 100 index, which was flat overall.&#8220;British American Tobacco&#8217;s final results show that it has benefited from the weakness of sterling and shareholders stand to gain from a 10 percent rise in dividends as a result,&#8221; said Ian Forrest, investment research analyst at The Share Centre.Reynolds&#8217; leading cigarette brands include Newport and Camel.-AFP
