Better known as one half of comedy duo Key and Peele, Jordan Peele makes his directorial debut with meet-the-parents scenario &#8220;Get Out&#8221; and looks to turn a knack for comedy timing to the ratcheting tension of horror.&#8211; What&#8217;s it about? &#8211;Setting itself up as a romantic drama with a race relations theme, &#8220;Get Out&#8221; has Rose bring her boyfriend Chris home to meet her well-off parents, Missy and Dean. Even before they arrive, the film starts veering off into horror territory.Missy offers to help Chris quit smoking through the use of hypnotic techniques, but it&#8217;s the entire weekend he&#8217;ll need help forgetting.A friend back home identifies Missy and Dean&#8217;s neighborhood as one in which a clutch of young black men have mysteriously disappeared, the parents&#8217; friends seem morbidly interested in Chris, and their hired help has an unsettling vacant look about them.&#8211; Who&#8217;s in it? &#8211;Daniel Kaluuya comes in from &#8220;Sicario&#8221; and &#8220;Skins&#8221; to play Chris, with Allison Williams of &#8220;Girls&#8221; becoming Rose.Oscar nominee Catherine Keener (&#8220;Being John Malkovich,&#8221; &#8220;Capote&#8221;) is Missy, and Bradley Whitford (&#8220;The West Wing&#8221;) is her husband Dean.The cast expands to include Keith Stanfield (&#8220;Straight Outta Compton,&#8221;) Caleb Landry Jones (&#8220;X-Men: First Class,&#8221;) Betty Gabriel (&#8220;Good Girls Revolt,&#8221;) Lyle Brocato (&#8220;American Horror Story,&#8221;) Marcus Henderson (&#8220;Django Unchained&#8221;) and Lil Rel Howery (&#8220;The Carmichael Show.&#8221;)&#8211; Who&#8217;s behind it? &#8211;Since the final season of &#8220;Key and Peele,&#8221; Jordan Peele has appeared in &#8220;Bob&#8217;s Burgers,&#8221; &#8220;Storks&#8221; and &#8220;Keanu,&#8221; the latter of which he also co-wrote, while &#8220;Get Out&#8221; is his own creation.Producer Jason Blum is well known as the CEO of Blumhouse Productions, whose horror-themed output has included &#8220;Paranormal Activity,&#8221; &#8220;Insidious,&#8221; &#8220;Sinister,&#8221; &#8220;The Purge,&#8221; and &#8220;Split.&#8221;&#8211; Is it any good? &#8211;Having premiered at January 2017&#8217;s Sundance Film Festival, &#8220;Get Out&#8221; has a 100% approval rating and an 8/10 review average at Rotten Tomatoes, an average score consistent with its Metacritic score.Some 257 IMDb users contributed to a weighted average of 6/10; of those, 69 gave it the lowest score possible and 104 awarded top marks.&#8211; When&#8217;s it out? &#8211;Debuting in the US and Canada one month after its Sundance premiere, &#8220;Get Out&#8221; opens February 24, with a March 17 date announced for the UK.-Relaxnews
