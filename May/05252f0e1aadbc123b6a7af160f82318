The New Age s expos of NSFAS-funded students using their state allowances to start up businesses as textbookprenuers comes amidst revelations that hundreds of other students are struggling through the academic year without any money for textbooks, food or accommodation.The academic year is almost halfway through and students are still waiting for SMSs instructing them to sign the online loan agreement forms (LAF).Frustrated students said it was difficult getting through the year without their textbook and meal allowances.Sibusiso Mthimunye, a Tshwane University of Technology (TUT ) student, said he applied for NSFAS a year before he was admitted but had problems with uploading the necessary documents. I sent an email to NSFAS explaining my problem and I was told to email my documents directly to them but there was no reply after emailing them, Mthimunye said.He continued sending emails to NSFAS and was later told that his application was still being processed. Even now, I haven t been given a reply regarding my application and I do not know how my fees are going to be paid, Mthimunye said.Thando Skhosana, a University of Johannesburg (UJ ) student said at the beginning of the year she received a message from NSFAS, saying she was approved for funding this year but has not received any allowance or signed the online contract.She said she went to the financial aid office on campus and was told that the university had to send her results to NSFAS for her to be able to get all her allowances. I went to the department dealing with results on campus and I was told to give them two to three weeks to sort out everything. I am living in private accommodation so I need the allowance to be able to pay my rent, Skhosana said.A parent of a second-year B Com student at UJ said her son who applied for NSFAS at the beginning of the year was still on a waiting list. She said she had been following up with the Department of Higher Education and Training since the beginning of March. I was told that my son s application has been declined because I earn R150000 per annum but last year the minister announced 100 times on all media platforms that children whose parents earn less than R600000 a year qualify for NSFAS bursaries. When I asked about that I was told that what the minister meant was that such children would be assisted with fee increments, the mother said.Her son is among the 53043 applicants from universities and TVET colleges that were unsuccessful this year. According to NSFAS spokesperson Kagisho Mamabolo, this was due to applicants not meeting the minimum requirements.NSFAS fully implemented its centralised online system late last year, allowing the funding scheme to have a direct relation with approved students .While the system has been criticised by student bodies, including the South African Students Congress (Sasco), NSFAS believes it has yielded positive results. Although we have experienced challenges, we have approved funding for 463470 students which is higher than the anticipated 405000 students. The centralised system allows NSFAS to have a direct relationship with approved students from the time they apply for funding, once they are approved, throughout academic life cycle, once the student graduates and once the student is employed and eligible to start repayments, Mamabolo said.LILLIAN SELAPISA, ANGEL MAHLO AND SHONISANI TSHIKALANGElillians@thenewage.co.za
