For once the main action this week will not be inside Parliament, but at the nearby Western Cape legislature where the ANC will attempt to mount a vote of no confidence in Premier Helen Zille.Tomorrow s vote will be engineered during a snap debate on Zille s pro-colonialism sentiments expressed on the social media.Although it is expected that the DA will use its overwhelming majority to defend Zille and defeat such a motion, the debate will also give the ANC a chance to get under her skin, make its own telling points and reveal just how united the DA is behind Zille.As Parliament winds down its work for this session this week, the full glare of the institution s premier oversight committee, the standing committee on public accounts (Scopa), will be focused on the SABC.Tomorrow and the following day, Scopa will be at the SABC s Auckland Park headquarters.Scopa chairperson Themba Godi said: We want to get the SABC right. This will see Scopa engaging with the leadership of the SABC until we are satisfied that the financial mismanagement rot is cleansed and good governance, adherence to the PFMA and national Treasury regulations have become common cause. He said Scopa was eagerly waiting for the investigation report on the totality of the presence of irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure by the end of March 2017. The SABC, like all public institutions, must be accountable to Parliament. Leaders of these institutions must never make public statements that suggest that accountability to Parliament has a negative impact. Accountability is a political and a constitutional right. Officials must choose their words carefully, Godi said.Scopa will also be looking in on the South African Post Office this week. The oversight body is interested in the history of engagement between the Post Office and the Department of Social Development/South African Social Security Agency on the disbursement of social grants. It is our unconfirmed understanding that the ministerial advisory committee had a number of meetings with the Post Office and as early as September 2014 had recommended among other things the use of the Post Office as from Saturday, Godi.He said Scopa also wants to gain a picture of the Post Office s capacity and state of readiness to disburse social grants as articulated in its Constitutional Court submissions, if it is given an opportunity to do so.The portfolio committee on basic education will also be in Guateng from today until Wednesday.It will be in the Ekurhuleni education district in Gauteng to monitor and oversee the overall state of schooling in the province.Chairperson Nomalungelo Gina said the committee would assess whether teachers and pupils were in school and in class on time and if learning and teaching were taking place for the full seven hours a day.The committee also wants to monitor the timeous delivery of pupil teacher support material, the provisioning of teachers and the progress made in the registration and admission of pupils. The committee would like to have an understanding of any further challenges, the contingency plans in place and possible assistance that may be needed, Gina said.Other portfolio committees will also be active outside Parliament, but in Parliament itself, several Committees will also be busy.Tomorrow the standing committee on finance will get a overview from the national Treasury and South African Revenue Service on their quarterly reports.Cricket South Africa will also advise the portfolio committee on sport and recreation about its strategic plans, governance, transformation and development.On Wednesday, the National Prosecuting Authority will apprise the Justice and correctional services portfolio committee on its budget and annual performance plan.On the same day, SAA will present its quarterly report to the standing committee on finance.The public protector will be in Parliament on Thursday to talk to the portfolio justice and correctional services budget and annual performance plan.She will be followed by the South African Human Rights Commission on the budget and annual performance plan.On Friday, President Jacob Zuma will officially launch the OR Tambo centenary project in the Mbizana local municipality. The Mbizana rural development hub will service 11 villages with a strong focus on value addition of grain as well as Hub primary production, mechanisation and establishment of a trading centre for farmers to assist cooperatives in growing the local rural economy to create jobs and sustainable livelihoods.-Dennis Cruywagen
