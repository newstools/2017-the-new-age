The Global Entrepreneurship Congress (GEC) will be held on African soil for the first time since its inception eight years ago.The four-day congress will take place in Johannesburg from March 13-16, when more than 4000 entrepreneurs, start-up champions, thought leaders, visitors, researchers and policy makers will converge on the Sandton Convention Centre.They will share ideas on how entrepreneurship can be developed to boost employment and grow the economy.Johannesburg was selected as the preferred city to host the conference in Milan, Italy, in March 2015, when Parks Tau of the ANC was Johannesburg mayor.The GEC local organising committee announced its readiness to host the conference at a breakfast meeting on Monday where Small Business Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu said: This conference will provide African entrepreneurs with an opportunity to link with the world. It also feeds into the issue of being a developmental state. All South Africans have to have an understanding of what this means. It has to be on the top of our minds .Johannesburg mayoral committee member for economic development Sharon Peetz said her department was committed to ensuring the conference ran smoothly. We will work with the Department of Small Business Development to make sure this event becomes a success, Peetz said.Gamuchiral Mutezo, CEO of Sea Africa, said a lot had been achieved so far. We have more than 120 investors who have confirmed they are coming. They have indicated to us that they want to engage entrepreneurs. The conference is about developing entrepreneurs and their business skills. They will network as well, Mutezo said.The GEC has previously been held in the US, United Arab Emirates, China, UK, Brazil, Russia and Italy.NTOMBI NKOSIntombin@thenewage.co.za
