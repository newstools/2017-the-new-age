The mother had voluntarily handed the child over.The case was adjourned to tomorrow when Sibongile will have to provide an alternative address for her bail application after she was told in court that she was no longer welcome at her family home in Umzinyathi, Inanda.The two accused, Sibongile, 34 and her boyfriend Mbokazi, 27, are facing charges of kidnapping and defeating the ends of justice following the widely reported kidnapping of the infant on Friday during an allegedly staged hijacking at City View Shopping Centre in Durban.The two co-accused were arrested on Sunday while on their way back to Durban from Greytown where Siwaphiwe was for two days with Mbokazi s mother.Mbokazi, a metered taxi driver, was arrested at the Mariannhill Toll Plaza with a female passenger and the baby, but she was later released due to insufficient evidence.Sibongile, who was already in police custody, helped set a trap for Mbokazi.His lawyer, Andile Dakela, said his client was en route to Durban Central police station where Sibongile was being held after receiving a call from her when they were arrested at the Mariannhill toll plaza.
