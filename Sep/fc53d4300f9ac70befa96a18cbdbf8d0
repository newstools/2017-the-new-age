THE road to the Oscars 2018 for two of South Africa s films is heating up, with the limited release of the coming of age film, Inxeba The Wound and Akin Omotoso s gripping true-life drama, Vaya.Both films have won the hearts of international film critics, but without a local release, they cannot qualify for the 90th Academy Awards in the best foreign language film category early next year.So to earn a possible Oscar spot, both films have decided to gamble with a limited release as their only hope to qualify.Inxeba will screen for seven days at Cinema Nouveau Rosebank Mall in Johannesburg and at the V&amp;A Waterfront Nouveau in Cape Town from tomorrow until next Thursday.Vaya s limited release begins in earnest tomorrow at Rosebank s cinema Nouveau. SA has only tasted Oscar glory once when Tsotsi took the honours in 2006.SIYABONGA SITHOLE siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
