Street artist Mfundo Rissik, who goes by the name Mr Ekse, has described his latest artwork in Newtown as a tribute to the female street vendors at every street corner who are the pillars of the city .The mural at Newtown Junction features a woman carrying what looks like a basin on her head. The basin is carrying the city of Johannesburg. They are the backbone of the city and they are not celebrated much. I wanted to say big up to all the women in the city, in the country and the continent, Rissik said.His work titled JoVendor sBurg is part of a larger body of work of a similar theme that includes A1 prints and a collaborative children s storybook. Rissik said he used his art to say what people wanted to say but could not.His art, he said, was different because he drew inspiration from his surroundings. The artist said graffiti was growing in the country and described the Cape Town graffiti scene as one of the hottest on the continent . Of course graffiti is not everyone s sport but the few who do it are coming along excellently. He said engagement between street artists and corporate companies was important for the benefit of both parties. It is a definite need. We need corporate to sell our art. We would not be able to do big murals without their backing. TNA REPORTERnews@thenewage.co.za
