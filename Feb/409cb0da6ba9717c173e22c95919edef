Following weeks of tormenting Absa Premiership sides in the new year, hot Absa Premiership title favourites Mamelodi Sundowns and Bidvest Wits will battle it out at Loftus Versfeld Stadium tomorrow evening.The Brazilians will play hosts to the Clever Boys at a venue that is fast becoming a fortress for Pitso Mosimane s men.The result of the match, which will start at 6pm, may not be felt straight after the game, but both sides will know that whoever walks away with maximum points would have sent a strong statement of intent to winning the league title.Having played three matches more than Sundowns so far this season, Gavin Hunt s Wits find themselves perched at the top of the standings with 34 points, while Sundowns are on 29.Of course, the gap looks too wide for Sundowns to be talked about as title favourites, but their form in their catch-up games suggest they have what it takes to go top.Just as Mosimane s team have been dispatching teams with relative ease, Wits too have been on cruise control, with their previous game ending in a 5-0 drubbing of Premier League clowns Baroka FC. On the bench, the clash will pit Mosimane against Hunt, while on the field, the country will witness two of the finest talents in Percy Tau and Phakamani Mahlambi going head to head.In fact, Hunt tried playing it safe with Mahlambi in the previous match against Wits, bringing him on late in the game as a way of showing that he wants him fit and injury-free for the Sundowns test.The winger sparkled when he came on and even contributed a goal, while Tau was on song when Sundowns won 2-1 against Platinum Stars and when the African champions thrashed Orlando Pirates 6-0 in recent weeks.After Mosimane had said his side does not have to beat Wits in what could easily have been mind games, Hunt responded with mind games of his own, before heaping praise on his star winger, Mahlambi. I always want to be at the front. We played 16 games. It is a long way to go. To be fair, the league is their to lose. They have talent. We have respect and humility going there. It is a fixture that we have to honour and try to win, Hunt said.MMASEKEPE MATSEBANE|mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
