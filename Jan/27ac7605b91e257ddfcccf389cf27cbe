Sad! #MerylStreep,&#8221; said Annie Clark on Twitter.Stella Rouse quipped in another Twitter message that Tuesday&#8217;s nomination was &#8220;yet further proof of #alternativefacts that she is overrated.&#8221;Streep got her first nomination for an Oscar in 1979 for her performance in the Vietnam war drama &#8220;The Deer Hunter.&#8221;She extended her lead as the most nominated actor ever with her 19th nod in 2015 for &#8220;Into the Woods.&#8221;She has won the coveted golden statue three times, most recently in 2012 as Margaret Thatcher in &#8220;The Iron Lady.&#8221; Before that she won in 1980 for &#8220;Kramer v.
