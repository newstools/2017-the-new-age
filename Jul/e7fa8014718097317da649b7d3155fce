Holding the book, Conversations With God, convicted murderer Percy Khoza said it was clear that he was going to jail.He said this to judge Cassim Moosa, who postponed the case to tomorrow to allow both the state and defence to argue whether Khoza should be given 15 years imprisonment for the murder of his girlfriend Mary-Lee Macumbe, instead of a life sentence.Khoza appeared relaxed as he stood in the South Gauteng High Court, clearly at peace with the prospect of being in jail for a long time. When judge Moosa asked for the matter to be heard tomorrow, Khoza said he couldn t make it as he had an appointment with a prison doctor preparing for him being sent to prison.When Moosa observed that it seemed the accused is already preparing for jail, Khoza said: It is quite clear that I am going to prison. The judge told Khoza to delay his appointment for Friday so that he could be in court tomorrow. We do not want to delay this matter any longer, Moosa said.Khoza, who was 22 years at the time of committing the crime, was found guilty of killing political science student Macumbe. He stabbed her 38 times and most of the wounds were around the neck, in October 2014.Khoza claimed his girlfriend and mother of his child Kgomotso Masemola murdered Macumbe after finding her at his home in Troyeville.He painted Masemola as a jealous and abusive lover who had threatened some of his female friends and colleagues.On the day Macumbe was murdered the two of them had made plans to meet but when Macumbe didn t return home her brother Ayrton called Khoza to ask about her whereabouts.He claimed Masemola was in a fit of rage when he found Macumbe at his home in Troyeville. She stabbed Macumbe and threatened to kill his daughter and mother if he didn t help her cover up the crime, he said.Khoza said the two of them wrapped her body in a carpet cleaned the floor and walls and burnt their bloodied clothes.He further claimed that the next day a friend helped him load the body into the boot of Macumbe s vehicle.They drove around until the car ran out of fuel and they dumped it.Last week, Khoza s lawyer, advocate Stephen van Rensburg, asked judge Moosa to change the charge of both murder and robbery from life sentence to 15 years. Both councils agreed that the robbery charge be changed to 15 years but the state said they wanted a life sentence for murder The defence argued that he should not get a life sentence for murder.Defence lawyer Cronje Krielo said they would tomorrow argue what came first when the incident happened. They will determine if murder came as a result of robbery or if it was premeditated murder. Through this they will determine a suitable sentence.NONDUMISO ZWANEnondumisoz@thenewage.co.za
