The African National Congress (ANC) in Parliament has confirmed that former Eskom Chief Executive Officer (CEO) has been sworn in as a Member of Parliament on Thursday.&#8220;We can confirm that comrade Molefe was sworn in this morning and was welcomed by the caucus. He will be deployed to a relevant committee at an appropriate time,&#8221; ANC Parliamentary caucus spokesperson Nonceba Mhlauli said.It is expected that an official announcement will be made on Thursday when the National Assembly sits.Last week Friday Parliament confirmed the nomination of Molefe as ANC Member of Parliament. Parliament wishes to acknowledge the nomination of Mr Brian Molefe, to fill a vacancy on the North West list of ANC Members of Parliament, which is depleted.The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Thursday however described the swearing in of Molefe as a major escalation in the civil war within the ruling party .The DA said the move was an attempt by President Jacob Zuma to control National Treasury. The fact that disgraced former Eskom group chief executive, Brian Molefe, was sworn in as a Member of Parliament today is a major escalation in the civil war within the ruling party and the battle for control of National Treasury, being driven by President Jacob Zuma, DA said on a statement.Molefe&#8217;s nomination has been marred by controversy with some questioning his branch membership in the party.Executive Mayor of the Madibeng Local Municipality Jostina Mothibe lashed out at what he called a campaign of misinformation against Brian Molefe s membership. We as the sub region we are in full support of what is happening currently we support and we see Brian Molefe leading in undertaking his duty, said Mothibe.Mothibe added that as a branch they were aware of individuals giving false information to the media. Divisions and ill-discipline in the branch cannot be tolerated. We will not allow such behaviour in the name of our branch ward 29 undermining the culture of a constitutional structure, said Mothibe.The branch produced Molefe s membership form from 2011 which showed that he was a member.The ANC Women s League in the province added that they were also behind Molefe s deployment. We support the appointment of Brian Molofe and we trust in the decision taken and we are in full support of it. &nbsp;
