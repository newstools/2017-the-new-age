The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) will today submit its first progress report to the Constitutional Court.This submission is in compliance with the order given by the ConCourt that Sassa submit quarterly reports highlighting the steps it is taking to ensure a new payment contractor is appointed.Sassa spokesperson, Kgomoco Diseko, said they will adhere to the order and ensure full cooperation by submitting regular reports.The ConCourt had given the parties involved in the litigation concerning the bungled social grants tender two weeks to come up with a process to determine whether Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini should be held personally liable.In March, the Constitutional Court ordered Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) to continue paying social grants for 12 months to all South African beneficiaries.The ConCourt ordered that the contract with Sassa be based on the same terms and conditions as the one that expired on March 31.Further, CPS s contract was extended for 12 months, with the suspension of the invalidity of the contract extended.The court has criticised the conduct of Sassa and Dlamini for allowing this situation to happen. CPS did not get a new contract as it had hoped.CPS and Sassa is being closely monitored by the court and independent technical advisors as a bidding process for a new entity is completed.In 2014, the department proposed that Sassa extend its current contract with CPS or draw up a new one for at least 18 months.Sassa had known in April 2016 that it wouldn t be able to take over the payment system from CPS.Justice Johan Froneman said: The parties must, within 14 days, report to this court whether they have agreed to the process in terms of Section 38 of the Superior Court Act. Freedom Under Law s director Nicole Fritz welcomed the ruling, believing that the process will allow for comprehensive ventilation of fact and proper determination of responsibility of those officials who sought to put in jeopardy the livelihoods of among the poorest and most vulnerable of South Africans.NONDUMISO ZWANEnondumisoz@thenewage.co.za
