Russian President Vladimir Putin is a bigger threat to world security than the so-called Islamic State group, according to veteran US Senator John McCain who also admits Donald Trump makes him &#8220;nervous&#8221;.Republican McCain &#8212; one of US President Trump&#8217;s most outspoken critics in his own party &#8212; said Russia&#8217;s alleged meddling in elections was a danger to democracy.&#8220;I think he (Putin) is the premier and most important threat, more so than ISIS,&#8221; McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation late Monday.&#8220;I think ISIS can do terrible things &#8230; but it is the Russians who are trying, who tried to destroy the very fundamental of democracy and that is to change the outcome of an American election.&#8220;I have seen no evidence they succeeded but they tried and they are still trying. They just tried to affect the outcome of the French election.&#8220;So I view Vladimir Putin, who has dismembered the Ukraine, a sovereign nation, who is putting pressure on the Baltics, I view the Russians as the far greatest challenge that we have.&#8221;McCain&#8217;s comments come with the Trump team embroiled in controversy over its relationship with Moscow, which US intelligence agencies say tried to sway last November&#8217;s election in the property tycoon&#8217;s favour.A broad investigation into Russia&#8217;s apparent meddling is being led by Robert Mueller, a respected former FBI director who was given wide powers to pursue the case as a special counsel.The US Senate and House Intelligence committees are also leading their own probes.Over the weekend the furore pierced the innermost circle of the White House with reports that Trump&#8217;s son-in-law Jared Kushner sought a secret communications link to Russia &#8212; an allegation the president called &#8220;fabricated.&#8221;Asked about the Kushner revelation, McCain, in Australia on a visit, said: &#8220;My view of it is I don&#8217;t like it.&#8220;I know that some administration officials are saying &#8216;well that&#8217;s standard procedure&#8217;.&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s standard procedure prior to the inauguration of a president of the United States by someone who is not in an appointed position.&#8221;When put to him by the ABC that some people feel nervous about international security with Trump as president, McCain said he understood why.&#8220;I am nervous from time to time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I do believe that the president has great confidence in the national security team. I do believe most of the time that he accepts their advice and counsel.&#8220;Can I tell you that he does (that) all the time? No. Does it bother me? Yes, it bothers me.&#8221;-AFP
