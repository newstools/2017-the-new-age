TEMBA Bavuma s poor showing in the Test series against Sri Lanka doesn t concern Proteas coach Russell Domingo. In the middle order batsman s five innings in the series, Bavuma only managed to score 21 runs and this includes two consecutive ducks.His position in the team is threatened by the possible return of AB de Villiers ahead of the tour of New Zealand in March. Domingo, the selectors and captain Faf du Plessis will have to decide who to drop if De Villiers avails himself for the tour.But the coach feels Bavuma is still an important part of the team, despite failing to score runs against Sri Lanka. Look, I suppose in the team there will always be that one batsman struggling for form. It is just the nature of Test batting, Domingo said. Three Tests ago, he probably won the game with Quinton de Kock in Hobart when he got that wonderful 70 and set up the game for us in tough conditions. A Test before that he got a wonderful 70 when we were 60/5 or whatever it was, so it s the nature of international cricket. You can t have all six or seven batters firing at the same time. And when that batter is not doing well, we must try to support him and it is important that other guys contribute. Meanwhile, with the Test series done and dusted, the Proteas will shift their focus to the T20 international on Friday in Centurion. Domingo is excited at the prospect of working with new young players who are hungry to impress. Farhaam Behardien will captain the side in the three-match series. I m really excited about the group of players that I will be working with. I m not going to see Faf (Du Plessis), JP (Duminy), Hashim (Amla), AB (De Villiers) or KG (Rabada). There will be 13 completely new players. They will be so hungry, so desperate to make an impression in South African cricket. It s exciting for us. I told them that we are going to have to play our A-game because it will be like the first day at school for a lot of these guys. nevillek@thenewage.co.za-Neville Khoza
