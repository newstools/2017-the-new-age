The future of 13 pupils from Gauteng s poorest performing schools has been put on hold while the department investigates irregularities.The independent school in Germiston, ironically named Brain Trust College, claimed that pupils sat the 2016 NSC examinations under supervision but their results were being withheld without proper explanation.When ANN7, TNA s sister news channel visited the school it was in a dingy rundown area near the city centre.Twenty pupils had registered for matric but only 13 of them wrote their exams while seven de-registered from the college in March.The private college said it prided itself on giving pupils a second chance by taking students who had been expelled from other schools, an admin member who did not want to be named,said. We accommodate all students and give them a second chance and a future, now why would the department withhold their results? This is not fair, she said.Gauteng department of education spokesperson Oupa Bodibe said we should remember a private school must perform much better than a public school . Brain Trust College is a poorly-performing school and an investigation is taking place into the school s assessments. Once the report is done we can reveal if there are the irregularities at the school. Brain Trust College showed ANN7 all the documentation and accreditation and a notice from the GDE stating that the results were withheld.The college staff want this to be investigated by a neutral party so that their 13 pupils can receive their matric certificates.While the investigation takes place, the 13 students are sitting at home with no clear plan in sight.The GDE sympathises with this but Bodibe said: Unfortunately the students have to wait for their results as we cannot reveal them until the report is revealed next week. The department said it would like to inform pupils that private colleges were not the only option for students who were not in public schools.There are FET colleges at their disposal.When ANN7 arrived at the school there were no teachers in sight and access to classrooms was denied so the news team was unable to assess the school programme but the college has an active Facebook site which gives the impression that all is well.CANNY MAPHANGAnews@thenewage.co.za
