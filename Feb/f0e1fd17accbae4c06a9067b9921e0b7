Student bodies have bemoaned the R5bn injection into higher education over the next three years, saying it would not adequately address the challenges faced by students in institutions of higher learning.The South African Union of Students (SAUS) said while the money would offer some relief to students, it did not address the overall challenge of access to education. We are generally not happy with the R5bn. It is an insult to students and if they keep ignoring students calls for free education we will respond in a way that is felt by the broader society, Sthembiso Ndlovu, SAUS general secretary, said.Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said in his budget speech that the R5bn was in addition to the increases of R32bn made in the higher education allocations in last year s budget. According to the national Treasury s budget review document, spending is expected to reach R89.8 bn by 2019-20. Of this amount, 42.7% will be spent on university subsidies, 21.9% on NSFAS and 9.7% for technical and vocational education and training (TVET) colleges.TVET students said while the R5bn was a welcome move, it would not mean much to them if it was mostly channelled towards universities. The South African Further Education and Training Student Association (Safetsa) said while it appreciated the government s efforts, the said amount meant little to them as it would still leave students in TVET colleges compromised.The South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) is happy that education continues to attract a bigger slice of the budget with 17.5%, which is over R240bn, going towards education. Sadtu spokesperson Nomusa Cembi said they hoped the increase by 12.5% a year for school buildings would bring an end to mud schools and provide proper sanitation for schools.-Lillian Selapisa|lillians@thenewage.co.za
