The African National Congress (ANC) stalwarts have called on the party to recall President Jacob Zuma.ANC veteran Murphy Morobe said the current crisis has left them with no choice but to call on President Zuma to be recalled because this is about the rights of all South Africans not just the ANC.&#8220;There is something terribly wrong with the ANC and the only Honorable thing is to recall the President so that we can rebuild the organisation.&#8220;We will continue to engage with ANC for a consultative conference to be de-linked, we support disciplined and principled action and we will also resolve to establish &#8220;council of elders&#8221; to meet with ANC Top 6,&#8221; said Morobe.The stalwart&#8217;s call adds to an increasing fall out following Zuma&#8217;s decision to reshuffle his cabinet last week. Trade Federation Cosatu on Tuesday also called for Zuma to step down with the SACP echoing the sentiments.&#8220;We have a crisis and it is a serious crisis, what has made things worse is the Cabinet Reshuffle,&#8221; said ANC stalwart Frank Chikane.ANC Veteran Cheryl Carolus added that they were very shocked by the reshuffle adding that Zuma &#8220;has just crossed the line.&#8221;&#8220;This has never happened in the history of ANC that one person who is President can defy his comrades,&#8221; Carolus said.Carolus believes that President Zuma only recalled Gordhan just to humiliate him. She said the President was advised to also fire Faith Muthambi and Bathabile Dlamini.&#8220;Muthambi and Dlamini&#8217;s performance should have been looked at,&#8221; she said.The stalwarts also criticised Zuma for allegedly not personally conveying his condolences to the family of Ahmed Kathrada who passed away last week.&#8220;It is unheard of that President Zuma did not even call the Kathrada family to offer his condolences. The government essentially told Uncle Kathy&#8217;s family to &#8220;postpone their mourning&#8221; those events show the level of crisis at the moment,&#8221; said Chikane.Meanwhile, ANC veteran Wally Serote said they were shocked following their last meeting when some ANC leaders said the party never agreed to a consultative conference.&#8220;During our last meeting we formed a team to look at the consultative conference, since then the party has not said anything,&#8221; said Serote.
