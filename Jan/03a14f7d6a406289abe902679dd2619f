Crystal Palace have signed Patrick van Aanholt from fellow Premier League strugglers Sunderland, the south London club announced Monday.The 26-year-old Dutch left-back has arrived at Selhurst Park on a four-and-a-half-year contract for an undisclosed fee, although British media reports said he could end up costing the Eagles as much as 14 million ($17.5 million, 16.4 million euros).Palace manager Sam Allardyce knows Van Aanholt from their time together at Sunderland and, according to the former England manager, was &#8220;instrumental&#8221; in helping preserve the northeast club&#8217;s top-flight status last season.Van Aanholt is Palace&#8217;s second transfer window arrival following the 12 million signing of Jeffrey Schlupp.Palace are just a point above bottom-of-the-table Sunderland in the standings and Netherlands international Van Aanholt is set to go into the Eagles&#8217; squad for Tuesday&#8217;s league match away to Bournemouth.&#8220;He (Van Aanholt) is a player that brings something to the team we have not got and hopefully he has an instant impact,&#8221; Allardyce said.&#8220;We had great success together at Sunderland where he was instrumental in keeping them in the Premier League last season,&#8221; added Allardyce, whose side were beaten 3-0 at home to Manchester City in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Saturday.&#8220;He will add pace and energy to our team, has strong defensive qualities and has the added ability to score and create goals. He will help in both departments.&#8221;-AFP
