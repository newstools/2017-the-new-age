A COMMUNITY meeting in Thabong yesterday led to an impromptu community policing forum being formed after police mentioned crime had suddenly increased due to gangs moving in on the area.The community meeting, which was led by sector commander Capt Neo Mokhantso who said a lot of abandoned shacks in the area have become a home for gangs.While Mokhantso was addressing the residents about crime happening in the area and that it needed to be reported, the people insisted on having a CPF at the meeting. The residents in the area are also not cooperative when it comes to the reporting of crime and they were not active in the CPF. Freedom Square is also notorious because human remains of two people were discovered in the area last year and it is situated next to the railway line that separates Bronville and Thabong, Mokhantso said.He said crimes that had been problematic in Freedom Square were house robberies, housebreaking, theft out of motor vehicles, assault and domestic violence. I am appealing to all of you to report any crime and importantly, gang activities that are taking place in this area, Mokhantso said.He encouraged the community to join CPF structures that would assist in reducing crime in the area and 25 people were immediately recruited. There are a lot of abandoned shacks in the area that are used by gang members for criminal activities, hence it is important to know your neighbour, please let us know when there is an abandoned shack in your neighbourhood so that we can check what is happening there, Mokhantso said.He said the CPF and residents together could stop crime in Freedom Square.-BECKER SEMELA
