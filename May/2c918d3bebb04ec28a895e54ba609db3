There is one match SuperSport United coach Stuart Baxter There is one match SuperSport United coach Stuart Baxter is desperate to win before he officially leaves the club for Bafana Bafanais desperate to win before he officially leaves the club for Bafana Bafana. The Nedbank Cup final on June 24 in Durban will be Baxter s last match in charge of Matsatsantsa a Pitori before shifting his focus fully to the national team.Baxter, who will be in charge of Bafana when they play Nigeria in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier on June 10, will return to SuperSport for the final. The defending champions reached the final through a 4-2 penalty shoot-out victory over Chippa United at Sisa Dukashe Stadium in East London on Saturday. Baxter could become the first coach to defend the title and win it for the third time with two different teams. I will be coming back after Bafana Bafana and don t ask me how I m going to do it, I will be a boomerang coach and keep coming back, Baxter said. But I m just glad for my players. They said to me before the game, it will be a great way to send you off , but that s irrelevant. The important thing is that if the players work as hard as they have done like they ve done this year, they deserve this final. I ll do everything I can to win the trophy for them. Having played 120 minutes on Saturday, Baxter said it was the last thing they needed as they travel to Libreville on Wednesday for the CAF Confederation Cup group stage match against AFC Mounana. Actually, we were very happy to go through this, Baxter said. We rotated the squad because at least we didn t use them in the league match on Wednesday last week against Chippa. Eight of them didn t have the first game in their legs which I think is why we had so many chances in extra time because Chippa were dead tired. They couldn t get out of their half. We were working them and we knew that. -NEVILLE KHOZA
