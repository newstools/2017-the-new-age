Timely cargo delivery using ports and developing the right technology to get it moved swiftly, will take centre stage when the annual maritime summit kicks off in Durban today.The conference is organised by the eThekwini maritime cluster, an agency of the eThekwini municipality to gather experts in the maritime sector to discuss ways to develop the sector, which is a money spinner for the economy of Durban and KZN.One of the top speakers at the summit is Mike van Tonder, IT (information technology) and service line leader for engineering consulting firm Aurecon.He will look at technological trends that will shape the movement of cargo via ports in the next 13 years.According to Van Tonder, the two key technological trends heading towards 2030 are the real-time tracking of containers (from loading to unloading) and the development of smart ports.He says that real-time tracking requires the creation of apps that allow customers, container owners and shipping agents to follow their containers from first loading to final unloading in real time. These will enable regular updates on all the processes and clearances that the containers have to undergo along the way.He says the effect of technology on ports has become politicised due to their perceived impacts on employment. There is this perception that robotics and smart technologies will replace workers. But I see this as just another industrial revolution. It is not going to destroy jobs, it is just going to change them into something else.Instead of a person driving a forklift, that same person will be retrained to drive the vehicle from a static console with a joystick and screen. The challenges, therefore, lie in interacting with unions and managing the entire employment issue, he said.The theme of the summit is Connecting Ports, Ships and Communities.Another highlight will be a two-day career expo to encourage the youth to consider careers in the maritime sector.About 1200 pupils from various disadvantaged schools will be exposed to presentations relating to the maritime sector, opportunities and also tertiary institutions offering maritime studies.Pupils will be mentored by experts in the industry who will be available to answer any questions the students may have or any guidance in accordance with their career development.SIHLE MAVUSOprovinces@thenewage.co.za
