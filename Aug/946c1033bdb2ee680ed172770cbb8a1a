Telecommunications giant Vodacom has outlined accelerated plans to expand network coverage for people who live in deep rural areas of South Africa to supplement the work that the Vodacom regions have done in ramping up network infrastructure outside of urban areas.On a practical basis, this means that Vodacom will be bringing data services to tens of thousands more people living in rural areas who only have voice services and Edge data services. Additional investment will increase network capacity, help provide improved voice quality and enhance mobile data speeds in rural areas. Andries Delport, chief technology officer for Vodacom, said: Broadband penetration has transformative power and is an enabler for economic and social growth and, as such, makes it an essential tool for empowering people in rural areas. A World Bank study concludes that a 10 percentage point increase in fixed broadband penetration could increase GDP growth by 1.21% in developed economies and 1.38% in developing ones. Through its continued investment in its rural coverage network expansion programme, Vodacom has already committed to roll out to an additional 150 small, deep rural communities this year alone.Most of these communities are in KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, Eastern Cape, North West and the Free State. Vodacom says it has already achieved 99.9% urban and 99.6% of rural population voice coverage and 99.9% urban and 95.6% of rural population data coverage.The group is now looking at innovative ways to connect the outstanding 4.4% rural population with data coverage and 0.4% population with voice coverage. What makes this challenging is poor available infrastructure and the very low population density, meaning that many base stations have to be built to cover the remaining rural areas, the group said.-THELMA NGOMA|thelman@thenewage.co.za
