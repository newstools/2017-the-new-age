The driver of the Ntuzuma taxi that killed pupils from the Sibonakaliso High School and Sivananda Technical High School will appear in the local magistrate s court on February 1 on five charges of culpable homicide, among other charges.This follows the death of a fifth pupil, Ndumiso Makhanya, who had been in a critical condition in hospital following the January 11 accident that left 17 others injured.The Sivananda pupil was among passengers who were on board the 14-seater taxi when it collided headon with a bus on Nyala Road on the first day of the school year.Four pupils died at the scene, three of them, Thabisile Myeni, Sibusiso Sibiya and Scelokuhle Rabushe, from Sibonakaliso High School while the fourth pupil, Ntobeko Ngidi, was a pupil at the eSivananda Technical HighSchool. The deceased were buried at the weekend.A pupil from the school said that this week was meant to be a fresh start for the traumatised pupils from the school, but the tragedy of Makhanya s death had plunged the school back into mourning. The funerals at the weekend had given most of us closure. The whole week leading up to the memorial and the burial at the weekend have left a sombre mood at the school, Enhle Zikhali said.Pupils from the two high schools said the deaths of their fellow pupils had affected them deeply and many of them had received trauma counselling.At a memorial service at the KwaMashu Christian Centre, head of education in KwaZulu-Natal Dr Enoch Nzama made a plea on behalf of the families.He asked for donations to go toward transporting a vital organ from America for the critically injured Makhanya. The organ has to be flown from America to South Africa and the family has that burden to shoulder on top of their child being in hospital in a critical condition, he said.But now Makhanya has succumbed to his injuries.Makhanya, who was meant to be attending Grade 11 this year, will be laid to rest at the weekend.Department of education spokesperson Sihle Mlotshwa said the grief from the deaths of the four pupils was already too much and the death of Makhanya added to that pain. We are saddened by his passing and extend our condolences to the family, he said.The family declined to comment, saying they were still in mourning.SIBONGISENI MAPHUMULO
