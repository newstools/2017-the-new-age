The ANC Youth League ( ANCYL) has on Monday called on ANC leadership to deal with Derek , after he apparently said he was not sure whether he would vote for the party in 2019.Hanekom is an NEC member of the ANC and head of the national disciplinary committee. According to the ANCYL Hanekom stated that he is not sure whether he will vote for the ANC in 2019. For a person who has such responsibilities he should have known better. Comrade Derek&#8217;s comment suggests that his vote for the ANC is dependent on who emerges as the ANC leadership in the elective conference this year in December,&#8221; said national spokesperson Mlondi Mkhize.&#8220;Secondly comrade Derek&#8217;s comments suggest that the ANC is less important than the individuals leading it. We strongly condemn this idea of comrade Derek. There can never be an excuse for such a comment.&#8221;ANCYL also stated that Hanekom&#8217;s comments must be fought. As they will not accept comments that affirm careerism in the movement. As the ANCYL we call on the ANC leadership not be tempted to let comrade Derek off the hook. It is important that we all remain disciplined in the organisation. We call on the ANC leadership to demand a immediate public apology, or comrade Derek must resign from the NDC and NEC, said Mkhize.The ANCYL hopes that the ANC leadership will deal with the matter despite the fact that ANC leadership seems to have turned a blind eye to this matter, it said.-TNA Reporter
