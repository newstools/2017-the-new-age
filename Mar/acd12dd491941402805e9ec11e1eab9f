The 2022 Commonwealth Games will no longer be hosted in Durban after the city lost the rights to host it due to financial constraints.Durban was awarded to host the games in 2015 as the only contender to make a confirmed bid after Edmonton in Canada withdrew in February.No replacement has been made despite Liverpool showing interest to host the games.DA KZN Leader Zwakele Mncwango has lambasted the ANC government for a wasting a lot of money on bidding for the Commonwealth Games.Mncwango said the city could not afford to host the games but minister of Sport Fikile Mbalula and ANC Mayors of EThekwini went ahead with the bid. This is a devastating blow to our city, and our people, who can only stand by and watch as millions of rands that could have improved our communities, delivered houses, improved services and created jobs have been wasted by the ANC government. We could not afford the Commonwealth Games from the start, but now good money has been thrown after a bad idea, said Mncwango. This is a potent stain on the work of Minister Fikile Mbalula, and the ANC Mayors of EThekwini who have supported the bid. We must not forget that the ANC pushed this plan through, added Mncwango.Mncwango said he will demand an investigation into the cost wasted by the City of EThekwini in the bidding process. will now demand a full-scale investigation by the Municipal Public Accounts Committee (MPAC) into the total cost wasted by the City of EThekwini through its involvement in the Commonwealth Games bid. The DA expects the MPAC to seriously scrutinise every aspect of this spending as so many millions have gone to waste, said Mncwango.-Ntsako Mashaba
