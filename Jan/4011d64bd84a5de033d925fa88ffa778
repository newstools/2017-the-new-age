The high-speed fibre to the home (FTTH) market has become the new gold rush for operators targeting high-density urban areas, such as gated communities, affluent suburbs and high-rise buildings.A number of operators have in recent months made huge investments after establishing the commercial viability of providing fibre to homes. The rollout by service providers is a demand-driven extension of the companies already fast-expanding fibre connectivity backbone, utilising gigabit passive optical network technology, to business parks and residential estates in all major cities.MTN, Telkom and Vodacom are aggressively targeting customers with special offers and cut prices.FTTH is designed to handle futuristic technologies such as 3D holographic high-definition television and games which will soon be ubiquitous in households around the world. Fibre will be able to handle the estimated 30Gb/s needs of such equipment that present technologies cannot.MTN, Africa s biggest telecoms company, recently announced a R1.2bn upgrade to its network in Kwa-Zulu Natal, which includes the deployment of fibre to the affluent Durban suburb of La Lucia. The company said the deployment marks MTN s first foray into FTTH in the province, following on Gauteng and Western Cape.MTN is trenching 21km to connect 439 homes.When complete, the project, which is capable of delivering speeds of up to 100Mbps, will provide residents of La Lucia with multiple benefits including the ability to stream high-definition videos, play online games, stream movies, do home automation and remote surveillance of their homes and businesses.Alpheus Mangale, MTN Business SA chief enterprise officer said: This marks an important milestone in our FTTH ambitions as it reaffirms our commitment to become a key player in this arena. MTN has already demonstrated a fibre offering to residents of Monaghan Farm, a gated community 30km north of Johannesburg.The company said the commercial delivery of fibre to the home capable of 100Mb/s was a first in Africa.Vodacom, SA s leading cellphone operator, said it was aiming at deeper penetration of the fixed-line business by expanding access to its fibre network, in order to offer fixed lines both to homes and businesses.Telkom has been aggressively punting its recently launched fibre to the home trial to encourage thousands of DSL internet users across SA to migrate to the broadband technology free of charge.DSL customers within Telkom s fibre footprint will be given the opportunity to upgrade their copper-based connectivity to the more advanced fibre network. DSL customers who are on 2Mbps, 4Mbps, and 8Mbps DSL products can now, for no extra charge, move across to the more stable and reliable fibre network, Telkom said.During the two-month trial, customers are also able to test Telkom s Boltspeed 10Mbps and 20Mbps fibre products for free.After the two-month trial is complete, customers will have the option to keep one of these two packages, or return to their original speed at the original price.The good news is that even if they select their original slower speed, the service will still be served over a fibre connection. Telkom s trial offer starts on February 2.SAMUEL MUNGADZEsamuelm@thenewage.co.za
