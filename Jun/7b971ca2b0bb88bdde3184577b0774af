The courage, integrity, patriotism and humility of the late Ahmed Kathrada have been recalled by different political parties in Parliament.However, some opposition parties could not resist using the occasion of paying condolences, which the Kathrada family could not make because of a bereavement, in the National Assembly yesterday to score political points.IFP leader chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi who, with Kathrada, was one of the first black people to sit in Parliament as democratically elected MPs in 1994, said his death was a painful moment for South Africa.He said he was honoured to have called Kathrada a friend. He would also be remembered as a courageous patriot, Buthelezi said. In a poignant end to his tribute, ANC MP Charles Nqakula reminded the House that Kathrada had had misgivings before he died about the state of his beloved ANC.Corruption, he said, was not only destroying moral values but was the biggest enemy of South Africans as well. He urged MPs as they were remembering Ahmed Kathrada to let us remember some of the things we need to do in order for us to provide service for our people so that they enjoy a better life .According to the EFF s Ntombovuyo Mente, South Africa has lost a giant. She said that the EFF wished to affirm that what Kathadra had wished for would happen: President Zuma would indeed step down.She urged ANC MPs to honour Kathrada by voting against Zuma if and when a no-confidence debate came before Parliament. Themba Godi, the leader of the African People s Convention, called Kathrada a selfless and self-sacrificing leader. As we enjoy freedom we must always remember those like comrade Ahmed Kathrada. Remembering Kathrada, he said, was remembering where we come from .UDM leader Bantu Holomisa hailed Kathrada as a tower of strength and a source of inspiration to generations.Calling Kathrada one of the many midwives of the South African Constitution, National Assembly Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor recalled his words at the funeral of Nelson Mandela when he said his life was a huge void and that he had no one left to turn to. At the end of the tribute, MPs from all political parties rose as one in honour of Kathrada.DENNIS CRUYWAGENdennisc@thenewage.co.za
