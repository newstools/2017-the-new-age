A police officer recovered a stolen vehicle in Burgersfort but lost his service pistol to the suspected thieves on Monday. While taking a statement from a complainant reporting a stolen vehicle, the officer realised the description of the car matched the Nissan 1400 he saw parked along the Ohrigstad-Leboeng road when he came to work, provincial police spokesperson Brig Motlafela Mojapelo said. The police officer decided to take his own car to go to verify the registration of the suspicious bakkie parked 11km away. While walking towards the vehicle, two men got out, grabbed him and pushed him into the nearby bush. A scuffle ensued and he seriously injured his finger. The suspects managed to take his service pistol, Mojapelo said. The policeman called for reinforcements and during the subsequent manhunt, a firearm belonging to the suspects was found in the vicinity, with the serial numbers filed off. The Nissan 1400 that was reported stolen from Tubatse was recovered, Mojapelo said.Provincial police commissioner Lt-Gen Nneke Ledwaba warned that the police would be relentless in pursuing the suspects in an effort to recover the stolen firearm.The incident came just a day after six armed men robbed a police detective of his service pistol in the same area at the weekend.A 43-year-old detective sergeant stationed at Lydenburg, Mpumalanga and a female companion were sitting in his car parked on a dirt road at Ditwebeng village in Mecklenburg, when six men armed with a rifle attacked them about 9pm.The suspects tied the pair up using shoelaces, drove them into the bush and robbed the police officer of his service pistol, R700 cash and a car music system.
