United Democratic Movement president Bantu Holomisa doubts the continued future of the United Democratic Movement-DA coalition at the Nelson Metro Bay municipality.The projection of a bleak future follows a standoff between mayor Athol Trollip and his deputy Mongameli Bobani, an acrimony that has lasted for several months.Holomisa was responding to a multi-party panel report set up to probe the toxic relationship between Trollip and Bobani. The report was released on Friday.The report paints a picture of two leaders who during the exercise of their responsibilities repeatedly breached their coalition agreement and as well as any attempts to resolve disputes.Earlier last week, the DA criticised the behaviour of Bobani, asking him to leave the council meeting by speaker Jonathan Lawack including other opposition parties.Bobani refused to leave the meeting I am not going anywhere. I m the deputy mayor. But Holomisa has been critical of this mentality of not wanting to give but always willing to take . He described this attitude of trying to enforce your own party s view over the other party as not working. I once told them, if it is not working, and it comes to a push, we will need to drop both of you. We are marching towards that (end) now,&#8221; Holomisa said.Bobani has accused the DA of not following the rules in relation to the appointment of the city manager. He believed the appointment was unlawful. I have always said this coalition is going nowhere. If Trollip and Bobani are not toeing the line, then let s deal with these individuals, Holomisa said.Meanwhile, the DA federal council chairman James Selfe said it was always difficult to manage coalitions, but said that all parties must develop an appetite to make the coalition to work. Even if the coalition continues without Mr Bobani at the helm, we value our relationship with the UDM and will continue to do so, Selfe said.TNA Reporter
