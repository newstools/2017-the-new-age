Western Cape Premier Helen Zille has slammed the South African Revenue Service (SARS) for the harsh actions it is taking against the author of the book, The President’s Keeper’s Jacques Pauw.  This comes after SARS proceeded to file a criminal and civil case against the investigative journalist for his book.  The Revenue Service is accusing Pauw of contravening the Tax Administration Act. “How does SARS choose who to prosecute? Pauw for exposing a web of criminality, involving the President, other gangsters (who are also tax evaders) but SARS charges Pauw??? No wonder SARS under-collected tax by R50-billion! Time to declare Tax Administration Act unconstitutional,” Zille said. His book came under fire from SARS and the State Security Agency which had also demanded it to be removed from shelves after it was published. The book made revelations concerning President Zuma’s tax affairs that he allegedly failed to submit a tax return for his first four years in office. It also alleged that he was paid R1-million a month for a particular period after he became the president. For revealing President Zuma’s tax affairs the author was accused of contravening tax laws.  However, Pauw said that he would challenge the legal action against him. “We will oppose the application and we will argue that I published the information legally and there was huge public interest in what I have published‚” Pauw told Radio 702. -TNA Reporter
