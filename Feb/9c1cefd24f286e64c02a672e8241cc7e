Dustin Johnson powered to a five-shot victory in the Genesis Open on Sunday, his long-sought first win at Riviera Country Club propelling him to number one in the world.Pulling double duty in the weather-disrupted US PGA Tour event, Johnson used his formidable length off the tee and a sure putting stroke to build a big lead and held on down the stretch.On a marathon final day he produced a third-round 64 and a final round of even par 71 for a 17-under par total of 267.He led by as many as nine strokes before a few late miscues, but with the win will end Australian Jason Day&#8217;s 47-week reign atop the rankings.&#8220;I believe in myself, I think I&#8217;m a great player,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;The best in the world &#8212; until now I probably wouldn&#8217;t have said I was the best in the world, but now I can say it.&#8221;Johnson admitted the top spot wasn&#8217;t something he dreamed of as a young golfer.Now that he&#8217;s there, he said, &#8220;It&#8217;s going to just push me to keep working harder and stay there.&#8221;Day could have maintained his position by finishing at least tied for third but closed with rounds of 75 and 71 to finish equal 64th on two-over 286.&#8220;He deserves it,&#8221; Day said of Johnson&#8217;s rise &#8212; which also took the American past second-ranked Rory McIlroy, who has been sidelined by a rib injury.&#8220;If he keeps playing the way he&#8217;s playing we&#8217;ve all got to pick our games up.&#8221;With number one on the line, Johnson made a blistering start on Sunday piling up seven birdies in his third round.That included three straight birdies to cap the round &#8212; a streak he continued when he returned less than 20 minutes later to open his final round with back-to-back birdies.A birdie at the sixth moved him to 20-under for the tournament &#8212; on pace to tie or break the 72-hole tournament record of 20-under 264 set by Lanny Wadkins in 1985.But Johnson&#8217;s run of 49 holes without a bogey ended at the ninth, and back-to-back bogeys at 15 and 16 saw his lead shrink further, although in the end that meant nothing.&#8220;Those were more playing a little too safe maybe,&#8221; said Johnson, who can now boast at least one victory in 10 straight seasons. &#8220;I knew I had a big lead, so as long as I didn&#8217;t make any drastic mistake I was going to be just fine.&#8221;&#8211; Pieters charges &#8211;Belgian Thomas Pieters had eight birdies in a final-round 63 that pulled him into a share of second place on 12-under 272. He was tied with Scott Brown, who closed with a 67.England&#8217;s Olympic gold medallist Justin Rose had an eagle and four birdies in a three-under par 68 to head a group sharing fourth on 11-under 273.That included PGA Tour rookie Wesley Bryan, who started the final round in second, five shots behind Johnson.Bryan, a three-time winner on the Web.com developmental tour last year, followed his third-round 63 with a one-over 72. Kevin Na shot a 70 and Charley Hoffman signed for a 67 to join the group on 11-under.The frantic race to finish 72 holes by nightfall followed a first-round fog-delay and a Friday storm that prevented most players from completing the second round.Johnson led by one after 36 holes, and was thrilled to triumph on a course where his six prior top-10 finishes included a playoff defeat in 2015 and one other runner-up finish.&#8220;It feels good to finally win because I felt like I&#8217;ve been so close quite a few times, and it&#8217;s one of my favorite courses to play on tour all year,&#8221; Johnson said.-AFP
