Introducing her alter ego Queen Choco, soulful and award-winning jazz singer Wanda Baloyi will on Thursday host a unique concert at Indigo Sky in Honeydew. The birth of Queen Choco was inspired by a successful collaboration with Louie Vega, an award-winning American DJ and record producer, in 2015. Baloyi worked with Vega on the remix of her hit single ‘Kisses’ from her ‘Love & Life’ album and loved the hands-on creativity of being a DJ.  Ahead of the concert, Baloyi said Queen Choco is a rare talent that is able to sing, dance and DJ, delivering an extra dimension of energy, originality and interest to her sets. “Queen Choco was born out of the curiosity and desire to explore her musical range by collaborating with a wide range of musicians, DJs and dancers, creating an alchemy of creative magic,” Baloyi said. It’s understood Baloyi will also launch her debut single ‘Vamos Acordar,’ featuring DJ Cleo, on the day. Baloyi believes in breaking musical stereotypes and that being an artist requires no labels. -TNA Reporter
