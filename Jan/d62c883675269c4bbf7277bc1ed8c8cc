Contrary to perceptions and accusations by the DA administration, the city of Tshwane s financial performance under the previous ANC administration was exemplary This emerged when the auditor-general issued the city with an unqualified audit report for the 2015-16 financial period.The audit comes amid ongoing allegations of corruption and maladministration against the Kgosientso Ramokgopa administration, by DA mayor Solly Msimanaga. This is the city s sixth consecutive unqualified audit report. During the first council meeting Belinda Beddia a representative from the auditor-general s office found that the performance information reported in the predetermined objectives was reliable and useful and that there were no material findings pertaining to the audit of performance objectives.She raised concerns that the municipality was the defendant in a number of legal cases and that no provision for any liability that could result had been made in the financial statements. Msimanga, who took over from ANC mayor Kgosienthoso Ramokgopa after the 2016 municipal elections, has been hammering the previous administration. While celebrating his 100 days into the job last year, Msimanga said he had uncovered a series of get-rich-quick schemes led by officials in the previous administration.Msimanga said he had spent time fighting corruption and undoing the financial disaster which he said was left by the ANC. Meanwhile, Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba said yesterday that the auditor-general s report for the city confirmed the rampant maladministration witnessed under the previous ANC-led government and is an indictment of that administration The city s audit outcomes for 2015-16 show an overall regression compared to the previous financial year.During 2014-15, six out of 12 city entities had a clean audit outcome while only four entities achieved this outcome in the 2015-16 financial year, he said. He said one of the serious issues that emerged from the audit was that in a number of instances, invoices from suppliers were not paid within 30 days from the date of receipt as required by law.Assessments by the auditor-general show that, on average, the city took 90 days to pay its suppliers. The longoutstanding payments to suppliers have a negative impact on the sustainability of business and ultimately the economic growth of the city, he said-Kutullo Madisha|kutollom@thenewage.co.za
