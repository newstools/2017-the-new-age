Lawyers for ousted South Korean President Park Geun-Hye denied all the charges against her at a hearing Tuesday before she goes on trial.Park, 65, was sacked by the country&#8217;s top court in March over a wide-ranging corruption scandal and has been held in custody for more than a month.She faces 18 criminal counts &#8212; five of bribery and 11 of abuse of power, plus one each of coercion and leaking government secrets.&#8220;We deny all the charges,&#8221; Park&#8217;s top lawyer Yoo Young-Ha told the Seoul Central District Court.Park&#8217;s attendance at the hearing was not mandatory and she stayed away from the court.In South Korea, a preliminary hearing is to review the charges brought against a suspect and determine future proceedings.Yoo said the defence had been overwhelmed by the prosecution&#8217;s 120,000 pages of investigation records and needed more time to go over them.The court decided to hold another session next week and open full proceedings a week later.The scandal centres on Park&#8217;s longtime friend Choi Soon-Sil, who is already on trial.When indicting Park last month, prosecutors asserted that Park, in collusion with Choi, took or was promised bribes totalling 59.2 billion won ($52 million) from three South Korean companies, Samsung, Lotte and SK, in return for policy favours.She has also been charged with coercing 18 large firms to &#8220;donate&#8221; a total of 77.4 billion won to two dubious foundations controlled by Choi.Park, daughter of the late dictator Park Chung-Hee, spent nearly two decades living in Seoul&#8217;s sprawling presidential palace before the corruption allegations engulfed her presidency late last year.The scandal sent her once-bulletproof approval ratings to record lows with millions taking to the streets for months calling for her ousting, though she also had a loyal following from groups of mainly older rival protesters.Park&#8217;s downfall has given the left-leaning Democratic Party the upper hand in the May 9 presidential election.Its candidate Moon Jae-In was on 39.3 percent in a JoongAng Ilbo opinion poll published Tuesday, giving him a commanding lead over centrist Ahn Cheol-Soo of the People&#8217;s Party (21.8 percent) and Hong Joon-Pyo of Park&#8217;s Liberty Korea Party (16.5 percent).-AFP
