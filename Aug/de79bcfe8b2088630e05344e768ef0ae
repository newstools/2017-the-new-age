The Deputy Minister of Higher Education, Mduduzi Manana has been granted bail of R5000 for assaulting a woman.Manana 33 made a brief appearance at the Randburg Magistrate s Court on Thursday on two charges of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.On Sunday morning Manana allegedly assaulted a woman after an argument ensued on who should succeed President Jacob Zuma at the party s elective conference in December.It is said that Manana slapped the woman when she labelled him gay.The Soul City Institute for Social Justice raised a concern that both the victim and perpetrator considered being gay as an insult. This alone indicates the amount of work that still needs to be done and a change of mindset in the society when it comes to issues of gender stereotypes, homophobic attitudes and utterances, said Makutoane.She added The Deputy Minister s apology does not mean the law must not take its course. Social Justice Organisations will be monitoring this case. There always has to be a social cost to such behaviour, whether in or outside of public office .The case has been postponed to 13 September 2017 for further investigations.-TNA Reporter
