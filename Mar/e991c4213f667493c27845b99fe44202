Western Cape Premier Helen Zille apparently walked out of the legislature when she was asked about her tweets defending colonialism, according to the ANC in the province.According to ANC spokesperson Kobus Grobler, Zille sat there for 15 minutes and when she was asked about her tweets by a member of the ANC and she just walked out leaving the Director General.This comes after ANC Western Cape released a statement calling for the DA to recall Zille.&#8220;Helen Zille&#8217;s version of history and her place in it has always been circumspect because it has never corresponded to what we know of her, ANC Western Cape leader of the opposition Khaya Magaxa said. The ANC says the DA harbours many such delinquents and protects them. Zille just carries on to call people of colour all sorts of stereotyped and prejudiced terms such as elephants, refugees, professional blacks and women that only take up space and take padkos (food for the road) home. DA provincial spokesperson Anneke Scheepers, says that she is not aware of Zille walking out legislature as she understands she is on her way to Singapore.More details to follow
