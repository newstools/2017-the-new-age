The Gauteng government has started implementing the recommendations of the Health Ombudsman including stopping the Gauteng Health Marathon Project and instituting disciplinary proceedings against the implicated officials in the provincial health department following the release of the report on the deaths of mentally ill patients in the province.The province has established a team comprising senior officials to respond immediately to the recommendations of the report issued by the Health Ombudsman, Prof Malegapuru Magoba, earlier this month. The Gauteng department of health will work together with the national department to overhaul mental healthcare in the province. The World Health Organisation has been contacted to provide expert assistance in the re-establishment of quality mental healthcare in Gauteng, provincial government spokesperson, Thabo Masebe, said.Meanwhile, Dr Gwen Ramokgopa was yesterday sworn in as a member of the Gauteng legislature and new Gauteng health MEC.This after former MEC Qedani Mahlangu resigned hours before the release of a damning report into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of 94 psychiatric patients.Nearly 100 patients died following their relocation from Life Healthcare Esidimeni to 27 unlicensed NGOs across the province following the termination of a long running contract between the department and the facility.At the time the department said the project was a cost cutting exercise. Makgoba, in his report, likened the conditions at the NGOs to concentration camps .The patients died of starvation and dehydration among other factors, with only one patient having died of mental illness related condition.Makgoba found that the decision to relocate the patients were flawed, shambolic and rushed, while Mahlangu and her top senior officials acted improperly and negligently.Ramokgopa who is no stranger to health, brings a wealth of knowledge to the department she once headed. She also served as deputy minister of Health.Forensic investigation by the SAPS is also being conducted, the provincial commissioner has been requested to centralise all cases related to the Gauteng Health Marathon Project to ensure that they are prioritised.The process to finalise post-mortems is also under way. The government has contacted three big hospitals in the province to be on high alert for critical matters.LERATO DIALE AND LILLIAN SELAPISAleratod@thenewage.co.za
