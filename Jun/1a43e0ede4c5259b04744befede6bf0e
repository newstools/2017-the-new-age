While Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba postponed a media briefing to address a way forward for the economy, the DA has written to Speaker Baleka Mbete asking for a snap debate on measures to deal with the recession, ratings downgrades and mass unemployment.Gigaba s press conference was scheduled to take place yesterday but it was postponed to later this week.The Finance Ministry said: This is due to the minister now having to attend a meeting with the ANC leadership on Monday. He will then meet with the economic cluster on Tuesday with the objective of developing a comprehensive response programme to the economic challenges. DA shadow minister of finance David Maynier said the decision by ratings agency Moody s to downgrade South Africa s sovereign credit rating to Baa3, with a negative outlook, was more bad news in a string of bad news. The move is a clear vote of no confidence in Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba and President Jacob Zuma, Maynier said. The decision by Moody s highlights the fact that political developments have had a negative effect on institutional strength, which casts doubt over the strength of and sustainability of the recovery in growth and stabilisation of the debt to GDP ratio over the near term, Maynier said.The DA would not sit back and do nothing when the economy had slipped into recession and when a staggering 9.3 million people did not have jobs or have given up looking for jobs, he said. And that is why we have written to the Speaker of the National Assembly, Baleka Mbete, calling for a snap debate on measures to deal with the recession, ratings downgrades and mass unemployment in South Africa.
