The future of Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela is likely to top the agenda when chairperson Kaizer Motaung addresses the media on club matters today.The club has called a press conference when according to the invite, Motaung is expected to make an important announcement. And this has sparked speculation the club was looking to review their contract with Komphela, who has a year left on his three year deal. Amakhosi have maintained a long-standing tradition with regard to pronouncements on the future of their coaches.Yet they could be compelled to address Komphela s future and avoid a flurry of off-season speculation by appointing his successor in time for pre-season. The club hierarchy has invariably stuck with coaches, but it could be difficult to defend Komphela, following yet another poor season. Komphela s future has been in serious doubt after failing to deliver a major trophy in two seasons. Under his guidance this season, Amakhosi haven t reached a cup final, suffering early elimination in three knock-out tournaments.The fans haven t made it any easier as they made their frustrations known on several occasions by throwing objects at Komphela and the players when results were not coming. Their league campaign has ended with three matches to go, with their shortcomings against lowly teams accounting for their inconsistent run of results. It s been a disappointing season for Chiefs as they saw their chances of winning the league disappear when they conceded a stoppage-time equaliser against Golden Arrows at home on Saturday.It was the third successive match that Chiefs had conceded late to drop out of the title race. They are now fifth on the log standings, a position they ended last season where they also finished empty handed. Their remaining three matches against Polokwane City at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday, Platinum Stars and Wits will be reduced to a formality.-NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
