As a woman I have developed an adaptive approach to leadership that is critical in today s world of rapid change. For me, this means dealing with woman leadership with open eyes, open ears, an open mind and an open heart.In my lifetime I have observed and encountered many labels of women by women such as when another sister is goal orientated, she is seen as aggressive, pushy, rude, and tactless. If she sympathises with subordinates, does not shout at them and lets them take important decisions, women colleagues and subordinates say she is not fit for the job.But the same women are not shy to describe a goal orientated man as assertive and having guts.As we celebrated International Women s yesterday, let us remember that a more gender inclusive world is as elusive as ever, courtesy of many of our sisters.Why are we perplexed that Hillary Clinton lost the US presidential elections? A startling fact was that more white women and white men voted for Donald Trump than her. Why women would vote for a man who delights in sexism, chauvinism and misogyny still beats me.Is it confirmation that for centuries research after research has showed that the so-called Queen Bee syndrome and gender bias have been a major obstacle to women climbing the leadership ladder.The findings, published in the journal of Social Science Research, add to previous evidence that the so-called Queen Bee syndrome can be a major obstacle to women climbing the managerial ladder.Far from encouraging other ambitious women, psychologists at the University of Cincinnati found female bosses are more inclined to obstruct other women.The research showed that men who report to a female manager get much more mentoring and support than their female colleagues.As well as the unwanted competition, researchers think this may partly be due to the fact women occupying senior posts want to blend in as much as possible with their male counterparts.As a result they tend to overcompensate by giving more support and advice to male workers, rather than female ones.A survey by the University of Lancaster University showed two-thirds of womenpreferred a male boss as they are straight-talking, less likely to talk about staff behind their backs and not prone to mood swings.In this study, men exceeded women in receiving job-related support from female supervisors and were more optimistic about their promotion chances as a result.The results were consistent with the notion that female managers have little or no effect on the career prospects of female subordinates and instead foster men s career prospects.German researchers said they found that women who answered to a female supervisor suffered more depression, insomnia, headaches and heartburn than if their boss was a man.These findings together with the general gender bias against women shows how embedded misogyny, chauvinism and patriarchy are across the world.For example, in the US, women chose a man who ridiculed and insulted women, faced multiple allegations of sexual assault and a recording of him bragging about groping women s genitals, made fun of a disabled person, threatened to ban people because of their religion and who maligned immigrants.There was also a race element in the last US election.About 94% of black women voted for Clinton and among white Republican women, 91% voted for Trump. For most white men, Trump s misogyny was no obstacle.Trump who was hysterical and shrill, whining and whinging won the election. Instead, Clinton was demonised for being corrupt , too establishment , in cahoots with Wall Street, cold, aloof, untrustworthy and with a changeable moral compass.It is encouraging that some findings have been more favourable to women leaders.Some studies contend that women make better managers than men because they are more supportive leaders, delegate more responsibility and foster the careers of their subordinates, especially the women who work under them.At the end of the day, the qualms about working with female bosses have more to do with the prevalent perceptions which are baseless.We don t have enough women in leadership positions and it is not getting better anything like fast enough.We do have more women going to university than ever before. The participation rate of women in the labour force has never been higher.When women lead, new concerns are placed on the agenda. When women speak, different voices are heard.Despite the worldwide gender bias against women, ladies must be at the heart of decision-making in all spheres, from parliaments, the judiciary and peace-making forums to global governance institutions, from local governments to households and from multinational corporations to small businesses.We want all decision makers, in all spheres, from heads of state, heads of governments and parliamentarians to CEOs, trade unions and party leaders, to advocate for substantive gender equality.We want to see more women in economic leadership to ensure that women shape markets and drive economic growth.As women, we don t want favours. We want understanding and we want to work equally hard and have the same challenges as our male colleagues.How long should misogyny, chauvinism and patriarchy remain embedded in our societies?As we observe International Women s Day this year, let us ignite the inner sister in each of us.Let us reach out and touch the little girl waiting for us to build a world with no gender bias.Mindsets have to change and acceptance of women in leadership positions and acceptance of women in general needs to increase.Carol Bouwer is CEO of Carol Bouwer Productions, founder of the Mbokodo Awards for women in the arts, creator of the SABC2 women s talk show, Motswako, woman activist and a businesswoman in her own right
