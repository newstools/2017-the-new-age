Commuters and taxi drivers at the Brits taxi rank received free advice on how they could manage their diets to avoid lifestyle diseases like hypertension.An outreach team comprising dieticians from Brits District Hospital, the hospital s health promoter and members of the communications department visited the taxi rank to talk to commuters as part of International Hypertension Day.Commonly known as high blood pressure, hypertension can be managed with the correct diet.The team met taxi owners, drivers and commuters in downtown Brits and impressed upon them how they should improve their understanding of what a healthy diet could do in improving the health profile of the community.The educational activity was part of the hospital s social activities programme, which is aiming at reinforcing the hospital s public health messaging.Hospital spokesperson Tshepo Mokono said it was imperative to target commuters and taxi operators since they formed part of the hospital s stakeholders. Taxi associations are some of our instrumental stakeholders that affect the value of our hospital because they transport our hospital users. We therefore felt it was important to reach out to them and increase awareness about International Hypertension Day and help educate them about issues surrounding high blood pressure, he said.Mokono added that dieticians shared important information with the taxi owners, commuters and taxi drivers on how a healthy diet was important to prevent any undiagnosed and uncontrolled lifestyle diseases like high blood pressure. They further encouraged them to start a culture of visiting clinics to have their blood pressure examined on a regular basis so that, where possible, the disease could be detected early enough, Mokono said. Other risks associated with high blood pressure such as smoking, lack of physical activity, drinking alcohol and unhealthy eating were highlighted, he said.The taxi drivers and commuters welcomed the initiative and some promised they would use every opportunity to spread the message of healthy living to family and friends.ELFAS TORERAIelfast@thenewage.co.za
