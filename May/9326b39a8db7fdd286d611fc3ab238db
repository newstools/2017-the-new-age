Manchester City&#8217;s Ivory Coast football great Yaya Toure is to donate along with his agent 100,000 to the victims and their families of Monday&#8217;s suicide bombing at a pop concert in Manchester that killed 22 people and left more than 60 injured.The 34-year-old four-time African player of the year &#8212; capped 102 times and a member of the Ivory Coast side that ended a 23-year drought in lifting the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations &#8212; is organising through his agent Dimitri Seluk to ensure the money goes to those it is intended for.&#8220;We want to help the victims, the families of the dead or those who are now in hospital,&#8221; Seluk told the BBC.&#8221;I spoke to Yaya on Tuesday and he was very shocked by the terrible news.&#8220;We have arranged with the Manchester Evening News (the local newspaper) to help us get the money to the people who really need it. We don&#8217;t want to send it somewhere and nobody knows where it will end up , we want to make sure it goes to people for whom every penny helps.&#8221;Seluk added that Toure is still in England despite the Premier League season drawing to a close last Sunday and so will be able to turn up in person to hand over the cheque.&#8221;I think it will take a few days to organise it, but Yaya is in England and can come and present the cheque whenever it is needed,&#8221; said Seluk.&#8220;Yaya loves Manchester and has a big affinity with the city and its people.&#8221;This fund is a chance for us to get the money to the right people, which is very important.&#8221;-AFP
