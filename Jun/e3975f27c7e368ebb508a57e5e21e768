Additional measures to drive transformation will be required to address the government s concerns regarding de-concentration of the audit market and transformation, say experts.In the face of criticism that mandatory audit firm rotation (MAFR) will not address transformation of the profession, the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors (IRBA) said it believes that the implementation of mandatory audit firm rotation is a first step which will force a break in closed and restricted markets which will allow opportunities for black auditors to participate, but it also noted that greater transparency is required with regards to audit firm ownership, transformation policies and performance.Audit rotation was prescribed as a rule for auditors to safeguard auditor independence and after April 1, 2023 no audit firm may serve a public interest entity (PIE) client for longer than the prescribed 10-year limit.The rule was issued in response to concerns of declining audit quality, excessive tenures and increasing concerns around a lack of independence, both real and perceived, that could negatively impact the quality of the audit opinions.IRBA reported that it had agreed with the Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba that while MAFR was best suited to address the independence of auditors by bringing an end to excessively long tenures of audit firms with their clients, it would not necessarily on its own facilitate the growth and participation of black audit firms in a market that has been historically dominated by the big four audit firms.Therefore, prior to the 2023 implementation date, additional measures would be required to prevent the mere rotation of audits between the big four and ensure that meaningful black participation increases through equity ownership and that black-owned firms are grown and capacitated to take on the work of large listed entities.It noted that there was a real need to increase the number of qualification routes to registered auditing by increasing the number of accredited professional bodies.The organisation also identified a need to improve the attraction, retention and progression approach for black auditors and ensure equitable opportunity and access on par with white counterparts .IRBA said that transformation of the governance structures that select and appoint audit firms was also necessary to ensure diversity and that the selection and appointment of auditors was not restrictive, selective or influenced by the management of companies.Since the gazetting of the measure on June 5, international regulators have started to respond with messages of support.Financial Reporting Council of the United Kingdom CEO Stephen Haddrill responded: I commend South Africa for its decision to introduce mandatory rotation and congratulate the IRBA for its leadership. This step builds on the leadership South Africa has already shown in corporate governance and reporting. The reforms of governance will in particular enable the success of rotation. They provide confidence that audit committees will take full ownership of tendering and put quality and the interests of investors above price in their objectives. Our own experience is that the re-tendering of long-standing audit contracts has driven innovation and improvements in audit quality and I look forward to the same experience in South Africa. thelman@thenewage.co.za
