Bidvest Wits sit on the cusp of winning their first major title in history as they go into their clash against Polokwane City tonight at Milpark Stadium.It could be all over in the PSL title race should the Clever Boys win and closest rivals Sundowns fail to pick up maximum points against Maritzburg United in the other keenly awaited match. As things stand, Wits are on 57 points and lead the PSL titleholders by two points heading into the two remaining PSL fixtures this season. Wits midfielder Thabang Monare said they are aware that they are on the brink of history tonight. But our focus is not on that, we are solely focused in our game against City because that is what is on our hands and we can manage to control, Monare said. Dividing our focus between our game and that of Sundowns and Maritzburg can cost us big time. So the only thing we want is to win and start preparing for the last game of the season. Last week, Wits fluffed a chance to open a five-point gap at the summit of the PSL when they lost 3-1 to Free State Stars as Downs also dropped points in a 2-2 draw with Baroka FC. It was disappointing to miss a chance to open a gap like that, but we have been working hard at training to rectify the mistakes that we made against Stars, Monare said. If Wits manage to win the league, their management will be reaping the rewards of the huge investment they have made since coach Gavin Hunt arrived four years ago. Under him the club management made a number of big signings including high-profile players such as Benjani Mwaruwaru, Chris Kantongo, Daine Klate and Onismor Bhasera.Their clash against City is expected to be far from easy for the Students with Rise and Shine fighting hard to remain in the top eight. The Limpopo outfit recently surprised many when they handed Kaizer Chiefs a 1-0 defeat on Saturday and they have been playing well.-SITHEMBISO DINDI|sithembisod@thenewage.co.za
