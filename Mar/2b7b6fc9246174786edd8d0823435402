The trial of two men accused of assaulting and forcing Victor Rethabile Mlotshwa will resume on June 26 to 29.The duo appeared at the Middelburg Magistrate&#8217;s Court on Thursday.Theo Jackson and Willem Oosthuizen, were caught on video forcing Mlotshwa into a coffin in August 17 after they accused him of trespassing.The two are facing charges of kidnapping and assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm.Jackson and Oosthuizen previously abandoned their bail bid, however, they later requested the court to grant them bail and said they would make R5 000 available.Unfortunately their application for bail was deniedMagistrate Emmanuel Dumehleli delivering his judgement said it was clear the attack on Mlotshwa was nothing else other than brutal racism adding that action speaks louder than words. Dumehleli however added that he does not want to create an impression that all farmers are racist. Even Blacks, Indians and Chinese can be racist. Racism is a virus the whole world is trapped under said Dumehleni.The court also rejected the argument by Theo Martins Jackson and Willem Oosthuizen that Victor had threatened them when they had the courage to place Mlotshwa in a coffin and that he had been trying to steal copper cables from them. If the applicants were threatened by the victim [Victor] surely when they handed themselves over they could have mentioned it said Dumehleli.-TNA Reporter
