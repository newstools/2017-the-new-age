THE Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (Icasa) denied e.tv s bid to move its 6.30pmnews broadcast outside of the prime time slot.Last year the channel launched an unprecedented application in order to maximise its profitability at the expense of its licensing conditions which sets out its news production schedule.Icasa subsequently conducted public hearings for the application which would have resulted in a change of when both e.tv and the SABC would broadcast their news bulletins.Icasa said it had taken the decision to deny the applicant s request to protect the public interest .Yesterday, e.tv group head of corporate affairs Vasili Vass said they were disappointed by Icasa s ruling as they were not given reasons for the refusal.SIYABONGA SITHOLE
