Former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva told a packed court on Tuesday that he was innocent of attempting to obstruct Brazil&#8217;s biggest anti-corruption investigation ever by allegedly bribing a former executive at state oil company Petrobras.&#8220;The evidence is false,&#8221; the 71-year-old former union leader told the federal court in Brasilia, denying any role in the alleged attempt to pay ex-Petrobras director Nestor Cervero not to become a state&#8217;s witness.Lula, a two-term president from 2003-2010, is one of the front-runners for Brazil&#8217;s wide-open 2018 presidential election but faces five corruption trials that could bar him from competing.-Reuters
