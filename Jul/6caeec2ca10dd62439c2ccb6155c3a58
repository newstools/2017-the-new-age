Fraudsters are taking advantage of SA’s high unemployment rate in a new scheme using hospital brand Life Healthcare to advertise for jobs that do not exist in exchange for a “fee”. Life Healthcare has issued a warning about numerous scams that use hospital names with the aim of soliciting money from potential job-seekers. The fraudulent advertisements have been predominantly placed on recruitment websites or job portals where Life Healthcare hospital names are used to advertise both genuine and fictitious vacancies at Life Healthcare. Seemingly, people can no longer tell the difference. In some instances applicants are requested to make an upfront payment as part of their application, often as much as R4000. Once applicants have paid the fee, they receive no further feedback and are unable to contact the person who posted the job advertisement. An HR executive at Life Healthcare, Juliet Mhango, said that was not how the group recruited new employees. “Over the past 12 months the hospital industry has become aware of fraudulent job offers, but we have seen a marked increase in these postings in the past few weeks. Job seekers who apply for hospital positions and are subsequently asked to make a payment upfront should not part with any money as this is not how we recruit.” Mhango urged job seekers to report these fraudulent adverts to the webmaster of the online portals where the advertisements were posted. “Rather visit our careers page and follow the application process from there. “While the position itself may well be an existing vacant position at Life Healthcare, the application process is not legitimate,” she said. If in doubt, job applicants should contact the HR administrator of the hospital in question to clarify whether the hospital had advertised posts on a particular career or recruitment website. -THELMA NGOMA|thelman@thenewage.co.za
