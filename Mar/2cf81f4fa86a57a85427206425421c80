Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said the international roadshow he was recalled from was crucial to the efforts to keep rating agencies and investors informed about the country.President Jacob Zuma recalled the Minister and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas on Monday without citing reasons.There has been widespread speculation of a Cabinet reshuffle.In the statement the Gordhan said the recall was shortsighted as this trip was to keep both rating agencies and investors informed about fiscal and monetary policy developments, more specifically and about topical contemporary policy issues in SA .This information, he said was crucial for investors to commit the funds under their management by buying South African government bonds (by lending to the South African government) and form their opinions about SA s credit worthiness and thus to pronounce on the country s rating. The ratings, he said, determine the cost at which SA will borrow the R730-billion it will need to meet its borrowing requirement for the next three years. Government on a weekly basis needs to borrow more than R13-billion in thedomestic market. Of government s total borrowing requirement, USD6-billion.needs to be raised in the international market over the next three years to partly meet government s foreign commitments, Gordhan saidThis money would contribute towards the building of public infrastructure roads, schools, health facilities, he said.-TNA Reporter
