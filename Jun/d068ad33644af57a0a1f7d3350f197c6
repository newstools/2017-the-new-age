Urbanisation and technological innovation and disruption have become the most dominant forces of the 21st century, Gauteng Premier David Makhura said after being appointed to serve as one of the co-presidents of the board of directors of Metropolis at its 12th World Congress in Montreal, Canada last week.Metropolis is a global network of major cities and city regions that serve as a hub, which explores issues that includes governance and concerns common to all big cities, metropolitan governments, regions, provinces and state governments. Cities and city regions have thus become the key centres of the innovation and drivers of economic growth and sustainable development.If all the major cities and city regions are more equitable and inclusive in their politics and economics, a better and more sustainable world can be realised in our lifetime, Makhura said.He said the Gauteng city region would like to take a lead in striving for a more inclusive, equitable and sustainable new urban agenda. Africa s cities and city regions are key drivers of Africa s industrialisation and economic integration. They have to provide bold leadership to their local populations if we are to save our planet from greed and plunder, Makhura said.The role of co-presidents is to promote allocated political portfolios and to represent Metropolis globally in respect of these portfolios. Other copresidents are the mayors of Barcelona, Berlin, Montreal, Sao Paulo and Guangzhou. Makhura s appointment bodes well with the Gauteng city region s international relations strategy, which aims to ensure that the province s international engagement and agreements are conducted in a manner that supports the implementation of the provincial government s bold plan of transformation, modernisation and re-industrialisation (TMR) and its 10 pillar programme, the premier s spokesperson, Phumla Sekhonyane, said.The organisation has been in existence for 32 years and Gauteng has been a member since 2008.It represents the authorities of 138 great cities and metropolitan areas in Africa, America, Caribbean, Asia, Pacific, and Europe.Makhura was accompanied by some of the members of the executive committee and Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba. I wish Makhura the best in this new feat of promoting the Gauteng province as an ideal destination for trade and investment. I would like to place greater priority on delivering basic services, especially to our poorest and most vulnerable, creating an environment that stimulates job creation for the 800 000 unemployed of our city, as well as ensuring transparent and honest governance, Mashaba said.NTOMBI NKOSIntombin@thenewage.co.za
