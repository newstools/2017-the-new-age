chaotic: The Economic Freedom Fighters has been the initiator of chaos in Parliament for most of the time and if this persists, it may one day to its great surprise discover that the very people who elected it to represent them, will reject the party. Picture: Gallo Images IN the country s Constitution, the ideas of respect and dignity are emphasised and rightly so because if we did not respect others life would degenerate into all sorts of difficulties, allowing a laissez-faire lifestyle to trump, with all literally doing as they please or choose and with rules of common decency no longer applying.In all contexts of life, and even in the most liberal democracies of the world, human decency is never frowned upon. The Bill of Rights enshrined in our Constitution says: Everyone has inherent dignity and to have their dignity respected and protected. If I did not like you and hated you with a passion, I am still nonetheless duty-bound, first by virtue of being human, to accord you, the person I hate, some modicum of respect. I may not hurl insults or expletives at you, I may not abuse you in any way that shows contempt and disrespect.If I did all of these things I might soon find myself having to face the might of the law and to answer for my untoward behaviour before the courts of law. In general terms, all the people of the world, even in totalitarian and oppressive regimes, cannot willy-nilly trample on my human dignity without having to face one form of censure or another.Communities who live in civilised democracies must live peacefully with one another, even when they hold different views about life and see the world dissimilarly. We have an unwritten contract that as members of communities we will cause no evil or harm to one another. In that way we commit ourselves to peaceable coexistence.To ensure that we all do the right thing of respecting one another and accord dignity and respect to all, the norms of decency are enforced by law through agencies such as the police and the courts.Additionally, time and time again, if we want to reinforce the notion that our survival in this world is dependent on the goodwill of all, we invoke the African saying that umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu (you are because I am). This is not just an empty dictum, it is a human injunction that we cannot simply ignore because of political expediency or because we think we can enjoy parliamentary protection, and so we can abuse others as we please without taking into account their inherent dignity .We belong together. Our representatives who met at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa) from 1991 to 1993, were concerned about the apartheid-inspired unrest and chaos and violence that had engulfed the country in which thousands of people died and lost properties because of the internecine violence.Today, nobody in their right mind should want to reignite the fires that came close to reducing our country to ashes.Great men and women worked together despite major political differences to find a solution to difficulties that tore the country apart. Disagreeing as they did on many fundamentally vital points, including the land question among others, they stuck together for a workable solution.In the end, political ideologies and differences that stood in the way of reaching consensus and a solution, gave way and allowed pragmatism to win the day.The oppressed, without being oblivious to the impact apartheid and colonialism had on communities, agreed at Codesa that a new path that would lead to the achievement of democracy, and the attainment of majority rule as opposed to being subjected to minority rule of the National Party and its apartheid policies, needed to be pursued.The commitment of the people of this country was to do away with apartheid and all its vestiges. In 1990, FW de Klerk s regime buckled under the weight of the peoples revolution, leading to the inevitable release of Nelson Mandela, all political prisoners and the unbanning of political organisations including the ANC and the PAC, among others.The mind of former president Mandela was crucial to the talks and so his wisdom and statesmanship led to the country achieving a miracle that led to the first democratic elections of April 27, 1994.There was no question that the Codesa process was in itself not a perfect or ideal solution. Yet with all its imperfections, it became a necessary and perhaps ironic process as a vehicle to achieving a democratic state for the people of the country.The point that must be underscored about the outcome of the elections, which was the by-product of Codesa, was that it gave this country not only a new start in the wasteland that the apartheid country had become but it led to majority governance by the ANC.The process brought an end to hostilities between sworn enemies. The peoples revolutionary armies were prepared to lay down their arms to follow the dictates of the outcomes of Codesa which, among other things, was to build a new society from the apartheid ashes.Up to then, many leading lights of the political struggle had died in the trenches fighting to unseat the minority government of the National Party.The leader of the South African Communist Party, Chris Hani, had been such a casualty, his body pierced by the bullets of a cruel society in 1993.This week chaos erupted in Parliament. But before it did, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) under the leadership of Julius Malema, were adamant they would not see themselves dead being addressed by President Jacob Zuma.But history is likely to condemn the EFF as the initiator of thw conflict that erupted in Parliament this week.The question to be pondered is, why would they want to deprive Zuma his constitutional right to address the joint sitting of Parliament?The Malema-led party made a meal of the assertion that Zuma was not fit to be president of this country and began to use expletives to pour scorn on the president s dignity.Some members of the ANC did not cover themselves in glory by describing members of the opposition as racists, an assertion, to her credit, speaker Baleka Mbete would not brook and said so in so many words in chastising the erring members of her own party.Zuma is a constitutional president of the country and so the EFF is wrong in making the invalid claim that he is not. It is obvious that the EFF does not like Zuma but just because we do not like him, or we think he is flawed, this should not translate into him being disbarred from being the president of the country.The party also claimed that he was a thief . But no court of law has made such a finding, despite whatever perceived and real weaknesses in his makeup.Certainly, the Constitutional Court did find early last year that Zuma and the National Assembly had ignored the binding remedial action of public protector Thuli Madonsela in relation to the Inkandla matter.We started by suggesting that the Constitution as prescribed by the Bill of Rights enjoins us as the citizens of the country to respect each other s dignity. Everyone has an inherent dignity and the right to have their dignity respected and protected. The EFF must develop the maturity it owes to the constituency to respect Parliament, even if it has issues with the president.It has been the initiator of chaos in Parliament for most of the time and if this persists, it may one day to its great surprise discover that the very people who elected it to represent them in Parliament, will reject it.This happens so quickly in politics.If you do not respect others, you will discover to your peril that others will return the disfavour.Jo-Mangaliso Mdhlela is a writer, commentator and head of the ANN7/TNA cadet course JO-MANGALISO MDHLELA&nbsp;
