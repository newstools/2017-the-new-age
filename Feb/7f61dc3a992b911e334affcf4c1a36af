Tiger Woods has admitted the combined toll of multiple operations on his battered body means he doesn&#8217;t think he &#8220;will ever feel great&#8221; again.But the former world number one said he hoped to be able to compete for titles and majors in the future, in an interview for Dubai magazine Vision.&#8220;I feel good, but not great,&#8221; said Woods, 41. &#8220;Granted, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever feel great because it&#8217;s three back surgeries, four knee operations.&#8221;The 14-time major-winner returned from a 16-month injury lay-off in December and has slumped to 674 in the world rankings.&#8220;I am always going to be a little bit sore, it&#8217;s just the way it is. But as long as I can function and function at a good enough level then I&#8217;m fine with that,&#8221; he said.Woods made an ill-fated attempt to play in the European Tour&#8217;s Dubai Desert Classic last week, pulling out with back spasms after a birdie-free first-round 77 left him 13 shots off the lead.Woods had missed the cut a week earlier at his first US PGA tour event of the year at Torrey Pines.He is entered for next week&#8217;s tournament at Riviera as he tries to recover form and fitness before a tilt at the season&#8217;s first major, the Masters in Augusta in early April.&#8220;The whole plan was to get my body, mind and spirit ready for that first full week in April,&#8221; said the 14-time major winner. &#8220;You know, I&#8217;ve done it (won at Augusta) four times and I&#8217;d love to do it a fifth.&#8221;Woods said he would carry on as long as he felt capable of winning, after a painful rehabilitation.&#8220;There were a lot of times I didn&#8217;t think I was going to make it back. It was tough, it was more than brutal,&#8221; he said.Woods, who has not won since 2013 and whose last major victory came in 2008, said golf was becoming a different game with the power of the &#8220;kids&#8221; dominating the world rankings, such as Jason Day, Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy.&#8220;This is the changing of the guard. All these guys can move it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t important to hit the ball hard, it was more important to hit the ball flush, but now these kids tee it up and just go after it.&#8221;But he still believes he can win again. &#8220;My generation is getting older, but if I&#8217;m teeing up the goal&#8217;s to win it,&#8221; said Woods.&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t change if I&#8217;m injured, coming off an injury, playing well or I&#8217;m playing poorly. If I&#8217;m in the event, it&#8217;s to win the event.&#8221;-AFP
