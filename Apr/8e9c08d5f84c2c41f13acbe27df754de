&#8220;President Jacob Zuma signing of the FICA bill into law has been welcomedThe Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment Act amends the Financial Intelligence Centre Act, 2001. The 2001 Act and other related Acts aim to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism.&#8220;The President is now satisfied that the Act addresses the constitutional concerns he had raised about warrantless searches,&#8221; the President said in a statement.&#8220;These amendments to the Financial Intelligence Amendment Act further strengthen the transparency and integrity of the South African financial system in its objectives to combat financial crimes, which include tax evasion, money laundering and the financing of terrorism and illicit financial flows. The amendments also make it harder for persons who are involved in illegitimate activities or tax evasion to hide behind legal entities like shell companies and trusts,&#8221; the statement read.Yunus Carrim, chair of the Parliamentary standing committee on Finance, welcomed the signing. The bill which has some significant opposition from the Progressive Professional Forum had been sent back for the committee to review. Our country has lost over R600 billion in illicit financial flows over the past 10 years. It is big businesses, not emerging black businesses that are primarily responsible for this. It is the poor and disadvantaged who ultimately bear a disproportional burden, said Carrim.The Committee believes that opposition to the Bill was based mainly on misunderstandings about or misrepresentations of it. It has always maintained that the Bill does not give the banks any more powers than they currently have, but it does strengthen the capacity of the state to tackle corruption. Our government has for over two decades played a major role in shaping the international regulatory standards that the FICA Bill advances. It is certainly not as if our country has simply succumbed to standards set by the imperialist countries of the north, said Carrim.Carrim said the Bill will ultimately serve the needs of the poor and disadvantaged the most and is part of our country s radical economic transformative agenda.&nbsp;But the Democratic Alliance said there was a risk that the Minister of Finance, Malusi Gigaba, could delay the implementation Fica Bill, David Maynier, shadow Minister of Finance said.The Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment Bill provides for the ongoing monitoring of the business relationships, sources of wealth and sources of funds of domestic prominent influential persons , and family members and close associates of domestic prominent influential persons , in South Africa, adding that it would be Zuma and the Gupta family that would feel the heat, reiterating a popular but unproven State Capture narrative that one family is influencing the Treasury.&#8220;The legislation only actually commences on a date to be determined by the minister and published in the Government Gazette,&#8221; Maynier said, and there was a massive task to identify domestic prominent influential persons and their associates.&#8220;There are also doubts about whether the Financial Intelligence Centre, which only has a budget of R289 million for 2017/18, will have the resources to effectively implement the Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment Bill,&#8221; Maynier said.Cas Coovadia of the Banking Association of South Africa said it was &#8220;relieved the President has finally signed the FICA Bill. We have been urging the President to sign the Bill for a number of months and, though we welcome the signing, it is a pity we reached a stage where FATF had to warn us we would be delinquent if we had not signed by June.&#8221; &nbsp;The Presidency pointed out significant advantages of the Fica bill including measures to strengthen anti-money laundering and the combating of terrorist financing regulatory framework in the Amendment Act include: requiring the identification of beneficial owners to prevent natural persons from misusing legal entities for nefarious purposes like evading tax; enhancing the customer due diligence requirements that will ensure that entities fully understand the nature and potential risk posed by their customers; providing for the adoption of a risk based approach in the identification and assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing risks, and assist in making customer compliance easier; providing for the implementation of the United Nations Security Council Resolutions relating to the freezing of assets relating to persons associated with terrorism; safeguarding information in line with the Protection of Personal Information; providing for inspection powers for regulatory compliance purposes in accordance with the Constitution; and enhancing certain administrative and enforcement mechanisms.
