Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will be quizzed in the National Assembly this week about Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini.When he appears in the House on Thursday for the second time in a fortnight to verbally answer questions, the leader of the opposition, Mmusi Maimane, will ask him how many times he has arranged with the minister to appear before the National Assembly or the social development portfolio committee.That question, one of six jotted down for oral replies, will probably be the opening of the door on a series of questions about the payment of social security grants on April 1.Opposition parties as well as the ruling party can be expected to want answers about the situation at the South African Social Security Agency, where the director-general, Zane Dangor, resigned last week and from Cash Paymaster Services.It could well be that Ramaphosa, given the platform and media attention, may well use the occasion to make an announcement and reassure grant recipients that they will be paid. Although he is the leader of government business, Ramaphosa is also the copatron of the Moral Regeneration Movement.It is in this role, that he will be squaring off against a question as to whether the government was considering any measures to restore social cohesion in communities afflicted by serious civil unrest protests, xenophobia, gang or drug-related violence.Ramaphosa will also face off against a question about nation building, the transformation of society and the realisation of a shared sense of nationhood, as well as progress made in the government s efforts to fight different forms of discrimination.Having been the government s point man in Lesotho, he will not be asked about bringing peace and stability to the mountain kingdom, but about South Africa s bilateral partnership on water supply and the delay in the construction of the Polihali Dam. The delays are set to affect the supply of water to Gauteng and adjunct areas such as the Ash River in the Free State.DENNIS CRUYWAGENnews@thenewage.co.za
