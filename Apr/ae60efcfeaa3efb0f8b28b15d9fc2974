Andile Mngxitama says white monopoly capital is likely behind the alleged plot to assassinate 19 cabinet ministers which he believes is part of a attempt to topple the government of South Africa.Mngxitama&#8217;s comments come after the Hawks on Wednesday arrested a 23 year-old male suspect in Midrand, Johannesburg believed to be the master-mind behind the assassination plot.&#8221; We are not surprised BLF has been saying that there is a plan to topple the government of President Zuma. It is a well orchestrated plan and conspiracy.&#8221;&#8221; This is the work of white monopoly capital and we know what they try to do is organise civil society and give it lots of money, then they buy politicians including members of parliament and they organise assassinations,&#8221; said Mngxitama.The Hawks arrested the suspect while he was explaining to a number of donors how the assassination of alleged state capture beneficiaries was going to be carried out.He is also alleged to have sent a series of letters to selected companies to donate money to fund the operation and an amount of R140 million was reportedly solicited for the operation.President Jacob Zuma and his son as well as former Eskom CEO and member of parliament Brian Molefe and all the Gupta brothers appear on the hit list of the group known as the Anti-State Capture Death Squad Alliance.Afrikaner civil rights group AfriForum has called for investigations to be carried out to determine whether the threat to the President and others named on the hit list is credible.&#8221; If these allegations are actually true and there is merit in the cases it should be investigated and people should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. If this is true it is criminal and we cant have a situation where organisations come together to plan things like that, &#8221; said AfriForum&#8217;s Hein Gonzales.However terrorism expert Jasmine Opperman has questioned the credibility of the threat.&#8220;There are several concerns here. Firstly a single person planning a coup of what is now being reported as 19 or as others speculate 23 senior government officials is highly unlikely,secondly organisations name are being mentioned as part of this plot but why are we only seeing one arrest,&#8221; said Opperman.According to Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi the communication of the Anti-State Capture Death Squad Alliance and the Anti-White Monoploy Capitalist Regime groups seeking funding for its activities was monitored which led to the arrest of the suspect. We picked up the information in October last year and we have been monitoring the suspect since then, said Mulaudzi.Opperman has questioned why the Hawks would delay taking action if the perceived threat was genuine.&#8221; If this was picked up in October 2016 and there was serious intent to execute, why wait until now because we are talking about the lives of senior government officials,&#8221; said Opperman.The suspect is expected to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate court on Friday to face charges of conspiracy to commit murder.-TNA Reporter
