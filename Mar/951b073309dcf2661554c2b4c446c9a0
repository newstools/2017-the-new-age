The issue of gangs that terrorise residents in communities around the North West province seems to have spread even to schools.This is the view expressed by the community safety and transport management department, prompting it to mobilise stakeholders in the province to deal with gangsterism in schools.The department noted that some of worst incidents have been reported in communities around Bloemhof and that there was a need to urgently deal with the situation before it spread further.The department recently called for a #GangsMustFall dialogue where thousands of pupils from nine schools in the area participated.Department spokesperson Thabo Sematle said that the initiative was meant to root out gangsterism in schools which he said seemed to be causing a serious disturbance to the learning processes.There was a division of opinion among pupils with some expressing concerns regarding the effects of gangsterism while others disclosed reasons why they choose to be part of these groups.Pupils spoke of the fear they have as some are trapped in this culture and they do not have an easy way out.Speaking on condition of anonymity, one pupil said: We are sometimes forced into doing things we don t like just for our safety. It s like these gangs own us and if this trend continues, I m afraid the future of many will be ruined. Gangs are said to foment hooliganism in schools and sometimes tensions spill over and pupils belonging to rival gangs get caught up in life-threatening fights. We join gangs for our own protection because if you re outside you don t have any defence, one of the pupils said.In most cases, the presence of gangs erodes what remains of discipline at schools leaving the institutions in a state of chaos.Teachers struggle to impose their authority as they are sometimes openly challenged by their pupils.It is through the influence of gangs that most pupils end up taking drugs and drinking liquor as they do this to please their friends.North West police spokesperson Brig Sabata Mokgwabone was one of the speakers at the dialogue and he pleaded with pupils to stay focused on their studies and avoid joining gangs. Mokgwabone said that those who broke the law would be arrested. Community safety and transport management acting head of department Buti Chuma also called on pupils to think of their future. These groups/gangs are not good for you. Think of the kind of future you want to have, you are the only one who can decide that. Listen to your teachers and parents, study hard and excel in your studies, then the sky will be the limit for you, he said.ELFAS TORERAIelfast@thenewage.co.za
