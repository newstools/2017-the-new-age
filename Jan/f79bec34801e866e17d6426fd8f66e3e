The North Gauteng High Court will today rule on whether Eskom should cut the power supply to eight municipalities.Judge Hans Fabricius heard the urgent application submitted by lobby group AfriForum in a bid to prevent the Eskom from cutting power to the municipalities this week. Fabricius will make a ruling today.He said that the Constitution does not oblige Eskom to provide electricity to ratepayers. You are entitled to electricity from the municipality, if you pay your rates. Nowhere does it say you are entitled to electricity from Eskom, Fabricius said yesterday.These municipalities are Thembelihle (Northern Cape), Moqhaka (Free State), Mailonyana (Free State), Nkentoana (Free State), Mantsopa (Free State), Tokologo (Free State), Nala (Free State) and Dihlabeng (Free State).Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe said Eskom has been negotiating with municipalities since 2011. It is within Eskom s statutory obligations to recoup the money owed to it, Phasiwe said.Fabricius said it was an irrefutable fact that municipalities owe Eskom and that municipalities have to pay up as per their agreements with Eskom.The judge rejected AfriForum s allegations that there was a court order saying Eskom can t interrupt the power supply to defaulting municipalities. Eskom has contracts with municipalities and therefore it would be incorrect to say that Eskom is punishing paying customers, Fabricius said.He said the idea that the public will be punished is not correct.He insisted that Eskom was simply fulfilling its obligations to collect debt in terms of the Public Finance Management Act.This was in response to AfriForum s application, which argued that law-abiding ratepayers should not be punished for their municipalities failures to pay Eskom its outstanding funds.According to the agreement between Eskom and municipalities, Eskom is obliged to supply electricity to municipalities which pay for it. In turn, municipalities sell electricity to consumers at an increased rate and use the revenue to provide other services.Municipalities owe Eskom R5.6bn. The top 20 defaulting municipalities owed R4.3bn or 76% of the total arrear municipal debt. Eskom signed payment agreements with 50 defaulting municipalities. Eskom has postponed the scheduled interruptions in Free State and North West 701270-TNA Reporter
