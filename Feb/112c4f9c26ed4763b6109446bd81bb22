Bangladesh got a harsh introduction to Test cricket in India as Murali Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara piled on the runs on day one in Hyderabad on Thursday.Vijay (98 not out) and Pujara (83) put on 178 runs for the second wicket to take the hosts to 206 for two at tea after electing to bat at Uppal Stadium.India skipper Virat Kohli on 17 was with Vijay at the break after Pujara lost his wicket to young spinner Mehedi Hasan in the 51st over.The one-off Test is Bangladesh&#8217;s first in neighbouring India and a chance to demonstrate their progress since gaining Test status in 2000.The visitors started well as seamer Taskin Ahmed bowled Lokesh Rahul for two in the very first over of the match.But Vijay and Pujara then laid a solid foundation for India, both reaching fifties after lunch as they made the Bangladesh bowlers toil on a sunny afternoon.Vijay, who survived a run-out chance on 35, took the attack to the opposition as he hit left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan for the only six of the innings so far.Pujara, who hit two centuries in the recent England series, surpassed former India batsman Chandu Borde&#8217;s domestic record of 1,604 runs in a season before getting out.Kohli walked in to loud cheers from the crowd and he did not disappoint, cutting a widish delivery for a boundary in the point region.-AFP
