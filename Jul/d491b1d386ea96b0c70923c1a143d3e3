South African Editors Forum (Sanef) has on Tuesday applied for an interdict against Black First Land First (BLF) in order to protect the constitutional right of freedom of the press.This is after the organisation marched to veteran journalist Peter Bruce, whom they accuse of being racist and for protecting the interest of white monopoly capital.The application is reportedly led by Sanef chairperson and News24 reporter Mahlatse Gallens.The intervention also follows the assault of another journalist who was trying to take pictures of the protesters who were outside Peter Bruce s house.Bruce was targeted the week before a series of articles and secretly taken photographs relating to his private life, indicating that he had been spied on.On Thursday he wrote a column in Business Day about the surveillance and mentioned Mngxitama as a &#8221;luckless land reformer&#8221; who had tweeted to him.&#8220;You are going to get a heart attack Peter, better prepare yourself&#8221; before the surveillance footage and personal information was published on a site complaining about White Monopoly Capital (WMC).The organisation decided to take on all journalists they believed were racist and that are involved in slander, fake news and covering up &#8220;white corruption&#8221;.-TNA Reporter
