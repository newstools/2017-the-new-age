The ANC in Bokone Bophirima has distanced itself from the arrest of three ANC members found in possession of an unlicensed firearm. Jafta Masilo, who is branch chairperson of Ward 14, Patrick Mathe and Solomon Rasello were branch delegates who appeared in court today and released without facing any charges. The ANC in the province said it was disturbed by the news. “What we have heard is that they were allegedly set up by a friend of one
of the comrades who is the owner of the firearm and comes from Snake Park
in Johannesburg, who joined them when they were coming to the Nasrec Expo
Centre from the conference registration point in Soweto,” the party said in the statement. The ANC leadership in Bokone Bophirima said the police should investigate the case thoroughly. “As the leadership of ANC in Bokone Bophirima, we want to make sure that our
participation in the conference and image is not dented by this. We also want to urge the police to fully investigate this unfortunate incident as we want the law to take its course.” -TNA Reporter
