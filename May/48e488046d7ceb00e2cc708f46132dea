New South Korean President Moon Jae-In on Wednesday declared his willingness to visit the nuclear-armed North, moments after taking his oath of office.Tensions are high over the North&#8217;s weapons ambitions and Moon &#8212; who backs engagement with Pyongyang &#8212; said he would work for peace.&#8220;If needed I will fly to Washington immediately,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I will also go to Beijing and Tokyo and even Pyongyang in the right circumstances.&#8221;He also said he would have &#8220;serious negotiations&#8221; with the US and China over the controversial deployment of the US anti-missile system THAAD.The deployment of the powerful system &#8212; aimed at guarding against threats from nuclear-armed North Korea &#8212; has infuriated Beijing, which sees it as a threat to its own military capability.China &#8212; the South&#8217;s biggest trading partner &#8212; has taken a series of moves against South Korean firms seen as economic retaliation, which strained ties.&#8220;I will do everything I can to build peace on the Korean peninsula,&#8221; Moon said, vowing to &#8220;further strengthen&#8221; the alliance with key ally Washington.US President Donald Trump recently suggested Seoul should pay for the $1 billion deployment of the anti-missile system, sparking anger in Seoul.The move raised questions over the ties between Seoul and its security guarantor, Washington, which has 28,500 troops stationed in the South.-AFP
