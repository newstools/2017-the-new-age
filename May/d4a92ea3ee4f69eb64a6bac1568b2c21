Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Siphiwe Tshabalala has defended this season s squad by insisting they are a good team which could have challenged for titles.With Chiefs finishing a second successive season without silverware, many have thought they didn t have enough quality compared to log leaders Bidvest Wits, Mamelodi Sundowns and Cape Town City. Shabba, who has been one of the best performing players at Chiefs this season, said the main reason for this season s failure was inconsistency. I think we had a good squad, the thing is we were not consistent and that was a major problem. We created a lot of scoring opportunities but we didn t convert them. We played good football and I think when people watch us play they enjoy the game. But sometimes good football only is not enough. You need results and I think in our last three or four games we didn t do well in that regard. We played well but the results were the opposite of our performance. Three consecutive games we conceded in the 93rd minute and it is something we shouldn t have allowed to happen. Chiefs final matches of the season are against Platinum Stars tomorrow and Wits on May 27 and Shabba said it is important to end the season on a positive note. We definitely need to up our game all the time. We need to be consistent and we need to fight for each other, Tshabalala said. We need to fight for the team and we need to fight for the coach as well. We can only show that on the field through commitment and unity. -NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
