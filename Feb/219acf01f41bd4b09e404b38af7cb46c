Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who turned 93 this week, celebrates his birthday on Saturday with a lavish party attended by thousands of loyalists outside the second city of Bulawayo.The ruling ZANU-PF party is hosting the event for Mugabe, who has held power since 1980 during a reign marked by repression of dissent, vote-rigging and the country&#8217;s economic collapse.Now the world&#8217;s oldest national leader, his actual birthday on Tuesday has been celebrated in a week-long extravaganza with state media filled with tributes and praise.The annual party &#8212; reported to cost up to $1 million (0.9 million euros) &#8212; includes a multi-course feast and vast birthday cakes, angering many Zimbabweans as the country endures severe food shortages.Holding the event at a school in Matobo has also riled locals as it is close to where many victims of Mugabe&#8217;s deadly crackdown on dissidents in the early 1980s are thought to be buried.At least 20,000 people are believed to have been killed in the massacres by North Korean-trained Zimbabwean troops, according to rights groups.&#8220;This should not be a place for celebration,&#8221; Mbuso Fuzwayo, spokesman for the Bulawayo-based campaign group Ibhetshu Likazulu, told AFP.&#8221;The whole area is a crime scene where the bones of victims of the massacres are buried.&#8221; Increasingly frail Mugabe gave a faltering television interview this week, vowing to remain in power despite growing signs of frailty.During the pre-recorded birthday broadcast, Mugabe paused at length between sentences and spoke with his eyes barely open.&#8221;The call to step down must come from my party,&#8221; he said.&#8220;If I feel that I can&#8217;t do it any more, I will say so to my party so that they relieve me. But for now, I think I can&#8217;t say so.&#8221;The state-owned Herald newspaper on Tuesday published a 24-page supplement of congratulatory messages from government departments and regime loyalists.Local ZANU-PF party activist Sibongile Ndiweni described hosting of the party as &#8220;a blessing&#8221;.&#8221;It&#8217;s an honour and privilege to have such a luminary icon celebrating with us,&#8221; he said.&#8221;President Mugabe is a national president who has the right to have an event wherever he feels like.&#8221;ZANU-PF has endorsed Mugabe as its candidate for general elections next year, and he remains widely respected as a liberation hero by other African leaders.He has avoided naming a successor, but his wife, Grace, 51, is seen as a possible candidate along with vice-president Emmerson Mnangagwa.Born on February 21, 1924, Mugabe trained as a teacher and taught in what was then Rhodesia and Ghana before returning home to join the guerrilla war against white-minority rule.He became prime minister on Zimbabwe&#8217;s independence from Britain in 1980 and then president in 1987.All schools around Bulawayo were closed on Thursday and Friday.&#8220;Our children were told their classrooms have been turned into boarding facilities, and they are being frogmarched to join the birthday party,&#8221; local poet and opposition activist Desire Moyo told AFP.-AFP
