The lawyer representing triple murder accused Henri van Breda has on Tuesday said that Sergeant Adrian Kleynhans misled the court about his observations of the property.Advocate Pieter Botha said this while cross-examining sergeant Kleynhans on day four of the murder trial in the Western Cape High Court.Kleynhans was the first officer on the scene following the attack on the Van Breda family at De Zalze Estate in January 2015.In his testimony Kleynhans stated that there was no way anyone could have entered the property without walking through the front door and gate.Last week Wednesday, Judge Siraj Desai led an inspection in loco to the home. And it was seen that it was possible for intruders to break into the property because there were no burglar bars on the window. The fence surrounding the property, at the gate to the airfield, someone would be able to scale the wall. Scaling the wall is simple, by someone stepping on a box and hoisting themselves, said Botha.Botha argued that Kleynhans testified it wasn&#8217;t a robbery because he didn&#8217;t want it to seem like intruders broke in.However, Kleynhans then admitted his original statement was incorrect by saying Van Breda was traumatized.&#8220;It is human to forget as it&#8217;s been more than two years since the murder took place,&#8221; said Kleynhans.-TNA Reporter
