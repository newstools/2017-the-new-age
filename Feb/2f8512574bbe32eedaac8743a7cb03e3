ANC secretary general Gwede Mantashe has urged party members to stick to the organisations programmes and policies instead of succumbing to the temptation to align themselves with factions in the ruling party, which has become a major source of division tearing the organisation apart.Addressing ANC supporters in Wembezi in KwaZulu-Natal midlands, where Mantashe delivered a memorial lecture on former ANC president Oliver Tambo, he urged the organisation s members to draw inspiration from the ruling party s values and traditions when dealing with divisive matters. The danger of factions doesn t help the ANC but destroys and divides the organisation, Mantashe said.The lecture on Saturday formed part of a series of Tambo lectures held across the country in line with the ANC s decision to dedicate 2017 to the late leader.Born in Bizana in the Eastern Cape in 1917, Tambo, who was ANC President from 1967-1991, died in Johannesburg in 1993.A founding member of the ANC Youth League (ANCYL) in 1943, Tambo played a major role in keeping the ANC alive while in exile following the imprisonment of several liberation movement leaders such as former president Nelson Mandela.The former ANC leader is also credited for having mentored one of the organisations great thinkers, Thabo Mbeki, who became the second president of the liberated South Africa after Mandela.In his State of the Nation Address (Sona) on Thursday, President Jacob Zuma dedicated his speech calling for radical economic transformation to Tambo. This selfless patriot has dedicated his adult life to a tireless pursuit of the liberation of our country and its people. He left a lasting legacy for all South Africans and not only for his organisation, the ANC, Zuma said. In his honour, we have declared the year 2017 The Year of Oliver Reginald Tambo. It is the year of unity in action by all South Africans as we move South Africa forward together. Tambo s son, Dali, who was Zuma s guest at the Sona in Cape Town, said his father had dedicated his entire life to the liberation struggle. He was born in the year of the Russian revolution, he turned out to be a Christian, a revolutionary and someone who dedicated his life to the liberation of our people, Tambo said outside Parliament.CLIVE NDOUprovinces@thenewage.co.za
