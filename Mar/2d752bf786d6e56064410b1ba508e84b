They may not have much in common, but Free State Stars coach Serame Letsoaka and his Orlando Pirates counterpart Kjell Jonevret face similar challenges.The two come from completely different worlds, differ greatly in culture and beliefs and hardly know a thing about each other s philosophy, except that they fight for a similar cause. But as Letsoaka battles to move Stars out of the relegation zone, Jonevret faces the mammoth task of lifting the Buccaneers out of their mid-season doldrums and into the top eight.Letsoaka will be chasing a miracle when they host Pirates at James Motlatsi Stadium, in one of six PSL fixtures tomorrow. Like Jonevret, Letsoaka has seen his players begin to fulfil his philosophy, though he hasn t enjoyed much success in the league since he joined the Free State outfit in January.He has only won once, drawn two and lost three. The record hasn t necessarily won over sceptics, who hold him accountable for Celtic s decline. But there is a sudden expectation and not just hope that this season will end in survival for Ea Lla Koto. The positive outlook could hardly be in greater contrast to the reign of Giovanni Solinas, the former Stars coach, whose lack of commitment to the Stars cause undermined his efforts to help steer clear of relegation and challenge for a rare top eight spot.There is a sense of sustainability this time around, even though it s fairly early days for Letsoaka, who is not fully tested in relegation dogfights. He has already suffered a 3-1 loss to old pal Steve Komphela of Kaizer Chiefs and faces a battle of wits with Jonevret. Stars are 15th on the log with 19 points and are left with nine matches to pull themselves from the bottom and achieve a top-eight miracle. Surprisingly, only four points divide Stars and 11th-placed Pirates.-Kgomotso Sethusha|kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
