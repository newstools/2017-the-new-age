After upsetting South Africans with her pray for my safety comments ahead of her Macufe Cultural Festival performance last year, American soul and R&amp;B singer Karyn White ironed things out with her SA fans at a press briefing at Steyn City yesterday. I was really saddened that my tweet offended people. I would never disrespect South Africa, because I really love it here. When I said pray for my safety, I meant the journey on the plane, I wanted to be safe from that, not my actual stay here. I apologise once more for causing trouble with that tweet, White said.The singer landed in the country on Tuesday ahead of her one night only all white themed Summer International Tour set for Pretoria s Freedom Park tomorrow night.The Superwoman hitmaker was smiling as she recalled her previous visit to Bloemfontein in October last year. The people here are great, the support has been overwhelming, she said.In a bid to make sure that her message was clear this time around, the Superwoman singer posted a video on social media expressing her excitement over her second SA stint immediately after landing in the country. Hey South Africans, I have arrived in your beautiful country. I can t wait to see you on Saturday, she said.Fans of the singer can look forward to some of her classic love ballads, which she promised to serve up alongside some of her uptempo songs that she knows fans will love. I ve learnt that South Africans love my love songs more, they are used to the more romantic side of me. But this time, they will see me moving across the stage as I will be delivering some of my uptempo music. The two-time Grammy-nominated songstress will not be alone as she will be accompanied by Metro FMs soulful DJs..The 56-year-old said during her long break from music she had been focusing on raising her 17-year-old daughter and being a businesswoman.During this time, she dabbled in real estate and only made her return in 2012.news@thenewage.co.za
