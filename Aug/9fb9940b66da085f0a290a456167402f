Hospersa in the North West will on Friday march to raise concerns on the high levels of staff shortages as well as occupational health and safety on the province.The march is scheduled to commence from Mmabatho Stadium (Modiri Molema Street) to North West Department of Health (Mafikeng).The province came under the spotlight in July when violent protests broke out when the public demanded improved service delivery.The delivery of health care was affected by the protest action and soon after it emerged that the provincial health department had appointed a temporary employment services agency to source candidates for positions of health professionals, hospitality staff as well as the outsourcing of ambulance services.&#8220;The appointment of this service provider sparked more protests which led to the stoning and vandalising of the North West provincial office and ambulances burned. Hospersa did not endorse this action and looked for other methods of addressing this issue,&#8221; said Hospersa Ke vin Halama.During the march a memorandum will be handed to the Provincial Head of Department of Health, to raise concerns on the awarding of this contract, the prevailing maladministration, staff shortages as well as occupational health and safety issues in the province.-TNA Reporter
