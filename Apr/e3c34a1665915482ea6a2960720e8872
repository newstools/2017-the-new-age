The International Criminal Court (ICC) is to decide if South Africa failed to comply with its obligation, under the Rome Statute, by not arresting and surrendering Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir to the court.During a hearing at the Chamber of the ICC on Friday, South Africa s legal representatives said there were a number of unfounded inaccuracies in the submissions by the prosecution.South Africa s legal representative, Prof Dire Tladi, said they rejected submissions by the prosecution that steps were taken to ensure the protection of al-Bashir only. Every intergovernmental conference hosted by South Africa is done so on the basis of a host country agreement. It is not the truth to suggest the host country agreement was concluded solely for the protection of one person, Mr al-Bashir, Tladi said.He also denied that South Africa had tried to block the ICC s requests to arrest the Sudanese president. The steps were taken with the preparation for the African Union (AU) summit and not just for the protection of Mr al-Bashir. It s not true that South Africa put in place potential impediments to the execution of the court requests, he said.The ICC now has to determine whether a finding of non-compliance by South Africa and a referral of the matter to the Assembly of State Parties to the Rome Statute and UN Security Council is warranted. Tladi said the legal team was there to show that a referral to these bodies was not warranted .In March, South Africa formally revoked its ICC exit after the North Gauteng High Court prevented the government s earlier attempt at withdrawal. South Africa was invited by the ICC to make written and oral submissions which would assist in deciding whether the country did not comply with its obligation under the Rome Statute by not arresting and handing over al-Bashir to the ICC during his visit in June 2015.In October last year, the government advised the UN of its plans to withdraw from the body but in February the court declared the move invalid and unconstitutional as it was done without Parliament s approval.South Africa s withdrawal from the organisation came after several courts found that failure to arrest al-Bashir in June 2015 was inconsistent with the country s obligations in terms of the Rome Statute.Al-Bashir is wanted by the ICC for various crimes against humanity. South Africa, as a signatory of the Rome Statute, was obligated to arrest him if he was within its jurisdiction.He was in South Africa for the AU summit and the state s argument for not arresting him was that he had come to South Africa as an AU guest and that he had not been invited by the South African government.The ruling and criticism levelled at the government prompted the country to move towards withdrawal from the ICC, which has been accused of targeting African leaders.ZODIDI MHLANAzodidim@thenewage.co.za
