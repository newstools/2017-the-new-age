THE arrival of Thamsanqa Sangweni at Orlando Pirates should bring stability to their central midfield. This is an area Pirates have struggled with in the last few seasons since the departure of Andile Jali in 2014. Issa Sarr and Oupa Manyisa have failed to click together and have been dominated by most opponents they faced this past campaign.Sangweni, who signed a two-year contract, is a powerful defender and also going forward, something which was lacking from both Manyisa and Sarr. If compared to other big teams in the league like Bidvest Wits, Mamelodi Sundowns, SuperSport United and Kaizer Chiefs, Pirates were thin in the central midfield and didn t come close to them.Wits had Thabang Monare, Granwald Scott, Phumlani Ntshangase, Ben Motswari and Xola Mlambo, while Sundowns had Hlompho Kekana, Tiyani Mabunda and Lucky Mohomi. Chiefs had Willard Katsande, Lucky Baloyi and George Maluleka in the central midfield, while Pirates had Manyisa, Sarr, Abbubaker Mobara who then moved to central defence and Gladwin Shitolo, who was hardly used this past season.With Sangweni, the Pirates midfield will operate more effectively and better although it is the department they still need to strengthen and are understood to be looking at Mlambo, Ntshangase and Motswari, all from Wits. But it s not only in the midfield where they are thin; their defence and goalkeeping department have been average in the past season and need to be strengthened.It s an area where Pirates don t have a leader at the back, a player of Lucky Lekgwathi and Siyabonga Sangweni s calibre. Happy Jele, Mobara, Ayanda Gcaba, Thabo Matlaba and Marc van Heerden have all operated there but have been poor this past season.They have already been linked with Wits captain Thulani Hlatswayo but it is highly unlikely that the move will happen now. Hlatswayo has made it public in the past that his dream is to play for Pirates one day and in a Soweto derby against Chiefs, but Wits will do their utmost to keep him if offers are made. Following their dismal season, the Buccaneers are expected to be busy in the transfer market by bringing in as many good players as they can.nevillek@thenewage.co.za-Neville Khoza
