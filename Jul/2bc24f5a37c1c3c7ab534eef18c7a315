PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma believes the embattled ANC will rise to the occasion following a constructive fifth policy conference.Zuma went on walkabout on day four of the conference at Nasrec. The curtain comes down on the conference tomorrow and he believes a lot of positives will be drawn from it.The president started his tour at the statue garden before viewing the displays in the halls. It (the conference) is going very well and we believe the ANC, as always, when the challenges are there, rises to them, Zuma said.He had a softer approach to the party veterans who withdrew from attending the opening two days of the conference, set aside for a consultative process.He praised the veterans for the improved quality of debate. I was impressed by the quality of the debate I think it has gone up. If you listen to the stalwarts, the youth and the delegates in general, they are really focused, he told journalists. This time we had more days, which gave us an opportunity to have more debate, seek more clarity and time to clarify issues. The conference comes at a time when the party is rocked by divisions ahead of the December elective conference.But Zuma was buoyant that the outcome would be productive. It is going well and I think anyone will agree when we say results are going to be wonderful (as well as) the recommendations to the conference come December, because the branches are debating any issue that you can think of, he said.The president said they had looked introspectively at the current state of the party. We have been very frank about it, looking for solutions to the challenges that face us and crafting solutions. Zuma said there was an emphasis on the importance to implement existing policies as well as the resolutions that would come out of the ongoing six-day conference.MTHOKOZISI DUBEmtokozisid@thenewage.co.za
