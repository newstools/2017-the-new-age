THE internecine battle afflicting the ANC in the Western Cape has taken the party s eye off Helen Zille, acting ANC provincial leader Khaya Magaxa says.He was speaking after five ANC regions called on the party s national leadership to disband the provincial executive committee.In his opinion, Magaxa said, it was unlikely this call would be answered. I think they would find it difficult to dissolve a structure before a national elective conference. Expressing his frustration with the factions pulling the party apart, he said these tendencies also existed when Marius Fransman, now suspended, occupied the chairperson s seat. On Zille, Magaxa said: We are dropping the ball.We were hoping to debate against Zille in the legislature on Thursday. Now this mess! How can we take our fight forward if we are divided? How can you call on Zille to step down if you are divided yourself? Legislature speaker Sharna Fernandez is still considering an ANC request for a no-confidence debate against the Western Cape premier.The ANC requested the debate in reaction to Zille s pro-colonialism tweets. Her office confirmed a no-confidence debate was in the pipeline, but there was no certainty it would take place on Thursday.DENNIS CRUYWAGEN dennisc@thenewage.co.za
