Tomorrow is the D-day for the Northern Cape Premier Sylvia Lucas following a deadline given to her to revoke her decision to reshuffle her provincial executives.The provincial executive committee (PEC) resolved that the reshuffling must be reversed, because it was a blatant disregard of the internal organisational processes . The eighth provincial conference resolved that the reshuffling that took place in blatant disregard of the internal organisational processes must be reversed. The conference instructed the incoming leadership to urgently deal with this matter, the PEC said in statement today.However, Lucas was this week adamant that he would not reverse her decision to reshuffle her executive. Her tough stand follows the Tuesday s meeting with the provincial ANC officials who had expressed dissatisfaction on her decision.In her statement, Lucas did not divulge the content of the said meeting, but stated she stuck by her decision to reshuffle her executives. The premier is of the view that she does not wish to discuss internal party politics in the media space. What she does wishes to state categorically with a clear and honest conscience is that she would not concede to the request by the officials to reverse her decision, the statement read.However, the PEC alluded that the key strategic centre of power resided within the ANC which is committed to pursuing the objectives of the National Democratic Revolution . The prerogative to appoint and dismiss members of the Cabinet, executive councils and mayoral committees should be exercised after consultation with the leadership of the organisation, ANC statement read.-Sipho Jack
