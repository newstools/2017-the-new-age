Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane today declared war against drug lords who sell to the youth during Youth Day commemoration event held in Ethekwini. The fight against the people who sell drugs in our communities and those who use children to sell them to other children is a battle that can only be won if we all stand together and fight it on all fronts, We must investigate, arrest and prosecute the criminals who come and sell drugs to our children, he said.Maimane pleaded with community members to help the youth escape substance abuse. We must offer those who got themselves caught up in drug abuse a way out through rehabilitation and reintegration into society. Many more of you are watching helplessly as your boys and girls are targeted by these predators who bring these things into your community,&#8221; said the DA leader.Maimane said that locking up dealers and treating addiction is just half the battle adding the youth should be provided with opportunities. At the same time we need to transform our cities into growing economic hubs, where job opportunities offer young South Africans a way out of poverty and desperation, Maimane said in order to emancipate the youth they should be afforded quality education the struggle of 1976 was for an education that frees us and gives us choices in life. Today this is still our struggle, June 16 is an annual commemoration for the 1976 heroic uprising by students in Soweto who fought out against the Afrikaans language being imposed on them as a medium of instruction.-TNA Reporter &nbsp;
