MORE than 4000 jobs have been lost in the Western Cape textile and clothing industry in the last five years.Western Cape economic development MEC Alan Winde said cheap imports of finished products and high duties for material to manufacture in South Africa were two of the key challenges.There was an uproar last year after it emerged that the official oversized tracksuits which were worn by Team South Africa which represented the country at 2016 Rio Olympic Games were manufactured by a Chinese firm.South Africans went on social media and branded the tracksuits cheap and oversized . The Southern African Clothing and Textile Workers Union said the tracksuits were an embarrassment.The union, which represents more than 90000 workers, said the officials should have used local designers for the tracksuits. More than 4000 jobs have been lost in the Western Cape s C&amp;T industry since 2011. There are 254 companies operating in the Western Cape, employing 18 406 people. These jobs remain under threat as national policies have failed to address the biggest concerns in this industry, he said.Winde said the challenges include cheap imports from China and Asia, illegal imports, high import tariffs on certain fabrics and outdated capital equipment and technology due to inadequate investment.Winde said customs authorities need to beef up enforcement to ensure that illegal imports of finished products is rooted out. We do note that measures have been put in place to assist the industry. These include incentive programmes funded by the Department of Trade and Industry to improve productivity, he said.Winde revealed that initiatives such as the Production Incentive Scheme provide companies with a grant which can be used to purchase equipment. This goes some way to increasing competitiveness, but not far enough. If we are to see a return of prior job losses, the DTI needs to take a serious look at some of the bigger issues the industry faces, Winde said.Clothing and textiles is the largest manufacturer in the province, supporting a large number of people, especially from poor backgrounds.&#8211; BATANDWA MALINGO
