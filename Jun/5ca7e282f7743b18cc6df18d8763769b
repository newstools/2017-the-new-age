Andy Murray admits he will have to improve dramatically to mount a successful defence of his Wimbledon title after the world number one suffered an embarrassing Queen&#8217;s Club exit.Murray crashed to one of the worst defeats of his glittering career on Tuesday as Australian world number 90 Jordan Thompson ended his reign as Queen&#8217;s champion with an astonishing 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 first round victory.Making the 30-year-old&#8217;s humiliation even worse, Thompson, originally beaten in the qualifying rounds, was only playing as a last minute replacement for the injured Aljaz Bedene.It was the worst possible preparation for Wimbledon, with the grass-court Grand Slam set to get under way on July 3.Having reached the French Open semi-finals earlier this month, Murray must have hoped he was back on track after his poor run during an injury-plagued first half of the season.But instead the three-time Grand Slam winner plans to go back to the practice courts with coach Ivan Lendl in a last-ditch bid to find a solution to his struggles.&#8220;I said before the tournament there was still a lot of work to be done, and after the French Open I knew that I was still quite far from where I needed to be,&#8221; Murray said.&#8221;One tournament doesn&#8217;t change all of what had gone on just beforehand. So that&#8217;s why I got back on the practice court quite soon after the French.&#8220;But I was certainly feeling better in the build-up here than I was going into the French. I would have expected to have played and done a bit better.&#8221;Murray has now failed to get past the second round in three of his last four tournaments. and has lost before the quarter-finals six times this year.It is a remarkable crisis for a player who just eight months ago was sitting on top of the world after a golden year that including titles at Wimbledon, the Olympics and the ATP Tour Finals. Confidence factor Murray looks bereft of form and focus at present and he conceded a lack of confidence was a factor.&#8221;I don&#8217;t feel like loads of my game has changed, but obviously right now I&#8217;m not playing as well as I was 12 months ago,&#8221; he said.&#8220;Most of that comes down to confidence in matches. It&#8217;s not so much that I have changed my serve or my technique.&#8221;It&#8217;s just when you&#8217;re playing a lot of matches and winning consistently helps you make better decisions at important moments.&#8221;Hopefully I get enough time on the court to work on some things, because I&#8217;m going to need to.&#8220;If I play like that, I certainly won&#8217;t win Wimbledon, but I can play better than that.&#8221;Murray has traditionally been at his most formidable on grass and his two Wimbledon titles in 2013 and 2016 were both preceded by Queen&#8217;s Club triumphs.Conceding that a lack of match practice on grass was a problem, Murray said he would consider adding some exhibition matches to his schedule next week.&#8220;This tournament has given me great preparation in the past, and when I have done well here, Wimbledon has tended to go pretty well, too,&#8221; Murray said.&#8221;It&#8217;s not ideal obviously, but guys have in the past have gone in to Wimbledon having not won lots of matches.&#8221;Novak (Djokovic) a number of times hasn&#8217;t played any warmup tournaments and played very well there.&#8220;I feel like I can still do very well at Wimbledon, but it certainly would have helped to have had more matches.&#8221;Murray&#8217;s exit overshadowed his generous offer to donate in tournament prize money to the victims of the London tower-block fire that killed an estimated 79 people.&#8220;I would have liked to have done well here for a number of reasons, that being a very good one,&#8221; he said.-AFP
