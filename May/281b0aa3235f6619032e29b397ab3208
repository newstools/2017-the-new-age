The vehicle that was found in Diepsloot had apparently been parked all day. As it turns out, the number plate is suspected to be cloned. There is a Quantum with that number plate. It took the girl, @LufunoLove said. The number plate is a duplicate&#8230; keep on minister, hope your team find her unharmed, @Lady_Bee24news@thenewage.co.za
