Maritzburg United interim coach Fadlu Davids has credited former mentor Ernst Middendorp for nurturing the youngsters who have impressed in the second half of this season s campaign.Davids, a club legend who guided the Midlands side from the National First Division in 2007 to the elite league, has vowed to turn to the youngsters for positive results as the season draws to a close. In the next two matches Maritzburg will be without experienced players defender Brian Onyango, attacking midfielder Deolin Mekoa and striker Evans Rusike. Onyango and Mekoa were given their marching orders during the 2-0 defeat to Orlando Pirates two weeks ago in Orlando while Rusike received a third booking against Baroka FC, which they won 3-1 at the Harry Gwala Stadium.Despite having to visit a wounded Chippa United next Wednesday, the Maritzburg caretaker coach sounded confident of a positive result. Credit to Ernst for shifting the mindset as he released some players and revamped the team. He did well in nurturing youngsters such as Banele Shandu, Siphesihle Ndlovu and Luyanda Ntshangase and they have not disappointed, grabbing their chance with both hands. About finishing in the top eight for the second time in the club s history, Davids said they first needed to reach the 32 point mark to ensure safety before setting other targets.The Team of Choice occupy seventh spot with 29 points and have seven matches left to wrap up the campaign. This league is volatile, we don t want to get ahead of ourselves. We will keep plugging away. Perhaps Davids s cool demeanour has had a positive impact on his players as they have remained calm during home matches, recording two wins during his spell in charge.The Cape Town-born coach doesn t even want to entertain talk of assuming the head coaching job he has filled after the departures of Middendorp and Roger De Sa this season. His focus is on completing his Uefa coaching licence.-Linda Ximba|news@thenewage.co.za
