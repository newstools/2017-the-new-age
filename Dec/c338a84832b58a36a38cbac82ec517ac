The National Energy Regulator (Nersa) has announced that they have granted Eskom an increase of 5.23% and not 19.9% as requested by the power utility. Chairperson of Nersa Jacob Modise said that the application is for a period of one year. “Due to increasing electricity demands, Eskom is experiencing coal costs and with that electricity price increase will have a poor impact on the overall economy.” He said that the energy regulator has considered input received from stakeholders in making its decision and conclude that the decision should be in the public’s interest. “The energy regulator has approved Eskom’s allowable revenue of R190.348 billion. This will result in an average percentage increase of 5.23%.” Meanwhile, Eskom says it is disappointed with today’s decision by NERSA on the allowed revenue of R190,348 billion for the 2018/19 financial year. “Eskom made its application in accordance with the Multi-Year Price Determination (MYPD) methodology which allows Eskom to submit any changes permitted by the methodology. This corresponded to a revised average standard price increase of 18.9%.” The utility added that they will await the regulator’s reasons for decision document for the 2018/19 allowed revenue in terms of the MYPD methodology. “This will provide insight into how this allowed revenue decision was made. “The reasons for decision document will enable Eskom to make an assessment on the impact to the business and then make a decision on the way forward.” Read more: Nersa hike ‘too little’ for Eskom -TNA Reporter
