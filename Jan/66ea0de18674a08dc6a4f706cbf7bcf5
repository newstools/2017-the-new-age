African National Congress Women&#8217;s League (ANCWL) Secretary General Meokgo Matuba says the women&#8217;s league believes that there is a need for a radical socio-economic transformation in our country.The ANCWL has called calls for the Judicial Commission of Inquiry or Parliament Inquiry to investigate various disturbing allegations of corruption and anti-transformation at SAA.This comes after alarming reports came to surface that it is facing internal and external forces who are doing all within their powers to fight any attempts to transform SAA particularly on procurement and employment equity.&#8220;This is done consciously to continue with only white owned suppliers being major beneficiaries of tenders at SAA. It is also a plan to ensure that only male occupies senior positions at SAA,&#8221; said ANCWL in a statement.The state-owned entity is said to have a very robust history with its controversy.According to the reports noted by the ANCWL, the SAA spends over R10 billion per annum on Jet fuel, from suppliers which are allegedly five companies that have been solely supplying SAA with jet fuel for over 80 years.&#8220;Ernest and Young report that uncovered corruption and irregular awarding of tenders is kept away from public domain and no action taken against all those who are fingered in the report.&#8220;Retired and resigned pilots from SAA are allegedly still receiving SAA benefits even after being employed by other airlines. This is due to an evergreen agreement contract signed in the 90&#8217;s,&#8221; said the ANCWL.The women&#8217;s league also touched on the entity&#8217;s lack of employment equity where white employees are dominant within the company.&#8220;We need radical socio-economic transformation, after 22 years there is still challenges of poverty, unemployment and inequality,&#8221; said Matuba. The State Owned Enterprises (SoE&#8217;s) must be the champions of radical economic transformation and employment equity.&#8220;ANCWL will persuade African National Congress(ANC) led government to compel all SoE&#8217;s through legislation, to do business only with suppliers having more than 50% black women ownership,&#8221; said ANCWL.-TNA Reporter
