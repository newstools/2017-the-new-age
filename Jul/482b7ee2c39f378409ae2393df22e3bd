As the country battles against drug and substance abuse, artist and social activist Kabelo Mabalane says the government needs to give as much prominence to International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking as the country does to World Aids Day, which is commemorated annually on December 1. It doesn t take rocket science to see that drugs are killing our young people faster than HIV-Aids so we must amplify this day and make more noise. We can t keep riding on the coat tails of 1976, we have a new struggle and this is it, Mabalane said. The international day against drug abuse deserves as much recognition as any other commemorated day in the country, he said.Gauteng MEC for social development Nandi Mayathula-Khoza said there was need to remove the stigma against those addicted to substance abuse as this makes it difficult to treat and rehabilitate those who are hooked to drugs, alcohol and other harmful stuff.Mayathula-Khoza has also called for closer cooperation between communities, local government and law enforcement agencies to win the fight against drug abuse. Community support and aftercare is extremely important to prevent, treat, rehabilitate and accept those addicted to substances. We need to break the stigma and promote faster recovery, Mayathula-Khoza said.This year Youth Day and International Day against Drug Abuse fell within a week of each other.The MEC said it was ironic that the youth of the country were being destroyed by drugs and other forms of addiction which are destroying them. As we commemorate the heroics of the youth of 1976, we must also face the reality that the majority of our young people are ravaged by drugs, she said.Tshwane is among the hardest hit areas by substance abuse with the dangerous new trend of bluetoothing taking the dangers of drug abuse to destructively high levels.The trend involves nyaope users exchanging blood through a syringe to share their high to cut costs.Susana Ncala, who started smoking weed mixed with cocaine in 2013 and continued until 2016, said that aftercare programmes remain an integral part in the road to recovery for former drug addicts.In a bid to help curb the escalating scourge of alcohol and drug abuse among youths, an aftercare programme was established by the department of social development to assist those in recovery to maintain sobriety and to lead a drug free life. Recovery requires that after rehabilitation one has to attend aftercare programmes or support groups and be linked with skills development projects. These programmes keep former addicts in constant check against relapses and serve as a platform where they share their experiences and challenges, 35-year-old Ncala said.Mabalane urged recovering addicts to stay connected to their social workers and support groups as this lessened the risk of relapsing. Even though I have been clean for 14 years, nine months and 25 days, I am always aware that I am one shot of whiskey away from relapse or a line of cocaine away from danger, he said.CHARLOTE HLANGWANEnews@thenewage.co.za
