More than R2.5m was paid to KPMG for a probity services 1 report, without a service level agreement, for the firm s role in setting up and managing the government s critical Integrated Financial Management System, an ANN7 investigation has found.A damning internal audit details how a total of a total of 54 IFMS processes were singled out by the audit, all of which were problematic. Of these, 49 were found to be catastrophic . The government in 2015 budgeted R4.3bn over five years for the setting up of the IFMS processes.The audit report was handed to former treasury director-general Lungisa Fuzile on September 11, 2015. At the time, Nhlanhla Nene was minister and Mcebisi Jonas his deputy.The report found the payment made on August 31, 2015, but there was no evidence of deliverables . KPMG s total contract for this project was R59m.Yesterday, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba acknowledged the ANN7 investigation and said he had instituted an investigation into the financial irregularities highlighted. In addition, today the national Treasury will brief the portfolio committee on the status of IFMS.IFMS was first cleared in 2005 for the integration across national and provincial government of supply chain, human resources, financial, payroll and business intelligence management.The audit report said the impact of the lack of financial controls in the KPMG case was catastrophic , a technical term used to suggest there was inadequate management of the financial management processes which could result in the national Treasury s brand and reputation being brought into disrepute.The fact that there were no deliverables indicated a lack of cost and project management. The expenditure was potentially fruitless and wasteful expenditure and it was considered to be irregular and unauthorised expenditure, the internal audit report said.It recommended that in order to fix these transgressions there should be regular reconciliations on expenditure, which should be tracked against deliverables to prevent exhausting the total budget without meeting the contract requirements. In addition, the report said that all IFMS payments in future should be approved only after quality sign-off on deliverables had been done by independent quality monitors.The internal auditors did not accept the IFMS Project management office s explanation that the probity reports would not form part of an evidence pack due to sensitivity .Instead, the report said: Any withholding of information from internal audit limits the scope of the audit in terms of the standards for the professional practice of internal auditing, more so as this review was commissioned by the audit committee. ANN7 and The New Age will bring readers ongoing coverage of this investigation.-TNA REPORTER
