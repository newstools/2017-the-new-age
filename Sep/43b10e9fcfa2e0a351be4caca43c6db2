Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane is delighted to go to the second leg of the CAF Champions League quarter-final tie with a narrow victory over Wydad Casablanca.The Africans Champions defeated the Moroccan side, Casablanca 1-0 on Sunday afternoon at the Lucas Moripe Stadium. Look it&#8217;s not too good. It s a slender lead but I rather go there with a 1-0 than 0-0, said Mosimane.Mosimane defended his substitution choices where he replaced striker Leonardo Castro with defender Thabo Nthethe in the 86th minute. Nthethe was playing as a central midfielder while Oupa Manyisa played as a striker. I didn t have fire power. I had nobody on the bench. I had to play Thabo Nthethe as a central midfielder. You know when you don&#8217;t have Khama, Laffor, George Lebese. So I&#8217;m thin upfront. So I played with Oupa as a striker in the last five minutes, added Mosimane.However, the outspoken coach lashed out at the match officials for getting the offsides wrong. They frustrated us but we had to dodge the offside. We ve got our way of doing it. Percy does, Khama does it. They look offside but they are not offside. We dodge the line. Is not offside but what am I gonna do. We do it even in PSL, once Percy is there alone is offside. We practise it all the time. By the time the ball was kicked he was not offside, concluded Mosimane.-Ntsako Mashaba
