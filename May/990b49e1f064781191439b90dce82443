The families of three mineworkers who were trapped and killed at Lily Mine have been compensated, 15 months after the tragic accident.The families of Pretty Nkambule Solomon Nyerende and Yvonne Mnisi have been paid the R200000 each that was promised to them. Confirmation of the payouts was made by Cosatu yesterday.The labour federation also welcomed the payment of R10000 to the 75 injured miners that were initially promised R50000.Cosatu said it would continue to work to support the fund raising efforts for workers to get the additional R40000. The mine has been paying the salaries of the three deceased miners to the families since the accident on a monthly basis. They are also receiving grants from the government.Cosatu s Sizwe Pamla said any company that takes over operations at Lily Mine needed to prioritise recovery of the bodies of the trapped miners first. We also want to see the continuation of an investigation that will help determine the cause of the accident and we demand that those found responsible be held accountable, Pamla said.Efforts to recover the bodies encountered a number of delays.The Mineral Resources Deputy Minister, Godfrey Oliphant, said they had failed the families of the mineworkers. Our commitment, however, is that we shall not give up the efforts to retrieve the container and recover the bodies of the three comrades. All we need is the cooperation of all affected parties and the suspension of our differences in this matter, Oliphant said.He said the inquiry into the tragedy is ongoing even though it has taken unreasonably long. We will await the outcome and act accordingly thereafter, he said.According to the deputy minister, they raised funds and Rand Mutual Assurance contributed R100000, the Chamber of Mines of South Africa R600000 and the Industrial Development Corporation R800000. I must emphasise that the amounts given to the families and mineworkers were ex-gratia payments only, in addition to other benefits and entitlements due to them. More work still needs to be done in this Lily Mine matter and we shall not rest until we find a mutually acceptable solution, Oliphant said.During his visit to the area in March Mpumalanga Premier David Mabuza promised to build 1000 RDP houses for the community.The completion of the 1000 RDP houses is planned for 2019.NONDUMISO ZWANEnondumisoz@thenewage.co.za
