Municipalities should stick to their core function of service delivery and stay away from dabbling in events and festivals.That was the message to new councillors at their Durban induction.They were told in no uncertain terms it was unacceptable for municipalities to hold festivals of no benefit to residents.Some municipalities such as eThekwini have courted controversy by staging events such as the Essence festival with big name performers.The municipalities have defended their support for such events as money spinners for their areas and tourist attractions. Festivals are not our priority and we are not there to run festivals. How do we strike the balance? KZN cooperative governance MEC Nomusa Dube -Ncube said.The councillors were reminded that they should at all times be rooted in the communities. As a councillor you should know what is happening in your ward. It s a tough job. We are not here to collect salaries but to work, she said.The councillors were also reminded that although they were politicians, they should be aware that decisions influenced by their political affiliation could bring their municipality to its knees.Citing the example of the Nquthu municipality in northern KZN where the council could not elect office bearers due to disputes between political parties, Dube Ncube warned councillors not to allow their political allegiances to destroy municipalities.It was counter-productive for political parties in Nquthu to point fingers at others for the state of affairs at the council. They collectively have a responsibility to make that council sit. Those councillors are being paid even though they are not doing anything.This is what happens when party politics are brought to the municipalities she said.The department last year put the municipality under administration after potical parties from the ANC-NFP coalition on one hand and the IFP-DA-EFF coalition, had on numerous occassions failed to elect office bearers.The IFP coalition, which has 15 seats to the ANC coalition s 14, was dealt a blow after an EFF councillor voted alongside ANC councillors.However, on learning about the councillor s plans, the EFF expelled the councillor.In December, cooperative governance MEC Dube-Ncube shelved plans to convene a meeting to elect office berears after receiving information some councillors could be attacked.Attempts by members of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) to get the parties to to elect office bearers also fall through, resulting in Dube-Ncube appointing an administrator to run the municipality.CLIVE NDOUcliven@thenewage.co.za
