The South African Communist Party (SACP) yesterday expressed shock after it emerged in court that there was a deportation order for Chris Hani s murderer, Janusz Walus.SACP spokesperson Alex Mashilo said the party learnt that even a prison warder was instructed to ensure the deportation. Walus has served 23 years of his 25 year prison term for killing the SACP/ANC leader. We are shocked that Walus s citizenship has been revoked in the last few weeks. We have and are still fighting against the parole because we believe that our and the Hani family s victim statements were not taken into consideration, Mashilo said.He said no further details were given regarding the deportation but he assumes that Walus may be deported to his home country Poland.Justice and Correctional Services spokesperson Mthunzi Mhanga said the department was not aware of the deportation. The minister is not involved, we also heard about it in court, Mhanga said.The court heard that Home Affairs had revoked Walus s citizenship and signed his deportation papers.Home Affairs spokesperson David Hlabane confirmed that Walus s citizenship had been withdrawn on the basis of his contravention of the law .He said the killer s deportation was set to take place once the Department of Justice and Correctional Services finalised its processes.Mashilo said when the SACP raised the matter of their victim statements with judge Nicolene Janse van Nieuwenhuizen in the North Gauteng High Court, she indicated that the victim s statements did not matter and should not be considered and it was time for the Hani family to move on . We are happy that the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) has taken information from the statements into consideration because we are dealing with a matter that needs a lot of consideration, which includes restorative justice, Mashilo said. We are positive with how the arguments went in court, that the SCA could most probably agree that Walus should not be given parole and the matter must at least go back to the minister. SACP members staged a picket outside the SCA in Bloemfontein demanding that Walus be denied parole and called for efforts to seek full disclosure of the circumstances about Hani s assassination.Walus was one of two men involved in the murder of Chris Hani in April 1993. He was granted parole last year, but the justice ministry appealed the decision.Mashilo said Walus remained unrepentant and a psychological evaluation showed he still harboured the hatred against communists that motivated him to kill Hani. He remains dangerous to a democratic South Africa where we have the right to become communists. That information cannot be ignored and we are shocked that they wanted to deport him, Mashilo said.Hani s wife, Limpho, despite being unhappy throughout the proceedings, thanked the ANC Women s League and the SACP for their support.Judgement has been reserved and an order was made for additional documents to be filed explaining why Minister Michael Masutha did not consider a victim impact statement from the Hani family.NONDUMISO ZWANEnondumisoz@thenewage.co.za
