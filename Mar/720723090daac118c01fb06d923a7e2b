A WOMAN who was arrested in a bus carrying dagga with a street value of about R3 000 has been fined R1 000 after she admitted guilt. The bus was travelling from the Swaziland to Nhlazatshe outside Carolina a few days ago. Ntomfuthi Mncina, 41, was making her second appearance in the Eerstehoek Magistrate s Court near Elukwatini last Friday. She was remanded in custody a week ago. She had been charged with dealing in dagga. Elukwatini police spokesperson Sgt Peace Mbokane said the arrest of the suspect followed tip-off. The police had to act swiftly to trace the described bus and managed to confiscate the dagga. The female dagga suspect was ordered to pay an admission of guilty fine by the court. We will continue to trace other people smuggling dagga into the province since our areas is located near the border of Swaziland as well, Mbokane said. FRANCE NYAKA
