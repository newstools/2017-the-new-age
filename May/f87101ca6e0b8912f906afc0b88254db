The North Gauteng High Court yesterday ordered President Jacob Zuma to provide records and reasons for his Cabinet reshuffle which saw former minister of finance Pravin Gordhan being replaced, within five working days.This was after the main opposition party, the DA, filed an urgent application with the court to force Zuma to give reasons for reshuffling his Cabinet on March 31.Judge Bashir Vellay yesterday said Zuma must supply all records and all documents relating to correspondence, contracts, memoranda, advices, recommendations, evaluations and reports that influenced his decision to reshuffle his cabinet.Zuma allegedly relied on an intelligence report when he removed Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas.DA legal representative Steven Budlender said the question on whether Zuma relied on an intelligence report was important to explain his rationale. He also said it was important to know the reason behind the decision because rationality needed to be challenged. Without reasons you cannot formulate rationality, Budlender said.He further said Zuma, as the decision maker, was the person obliged to furnish the court with a record.Representing Zuma, senior counsel Ishmael Semenya, said the DA was using the courts to challenge executive decisions, adding that if the judge ruled in the DA s favour, it would mean that the executive couldn t take a decision unless there was a record of that decision.At the World Economic Forum in Durban, Zuma said he reshuffled his Cabinet to give young people a chance at leadership and to prepare them for the future.Constitutional law expert Shadrack Gutto said Zuma s midnight Cabinet reshuffle failed the rationality test.nondumisoz@thenewage.co.za
