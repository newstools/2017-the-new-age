IT HAS become the norm for South African stars to return home when the going gets tough abroad. And after spending almost a decade in Europe, one time Bafana Bafana s Daylon Claassen is the latest player to join the growing list after he signed with PSL champions Bidvest Wits yesterday.Claassen s return to the PSL comes just a month after Ayanda Patosi joined Cape Town City from Belgian side KSC Lokeren. The 27-year-old Claassen was a free agent after parting ways with 1860 Munich of Germany after spending three seasons with the club.However, the Klerksdorp-born midfielder didn t have it easy at the club as he saw limited game time, making only 15 appearances in the previous campaign, scoring just one goal.Some of the players who returned home early include Mandla Masango and Tefu Mashamaite, who both failed to stay longer than two years abroad. Despite that, Wits coach Gavin Hunt is elated to have signed the former Ajax Cape Town player, who started training with the rest of the team yesterday morning.Hunt feels the right winger will be a perfect replacement for the departing Mogakolodi Ngele, who returns to Mamelodi Sundowns as his loan deal has ended. I feel with Ngele going we need that pass, do you understand? You need the pass, like every team needs that final ball and I think Claassen can give us that, Hunt said.Claassen, who has nine Bafana caps to his name, left South Africa as an 18 year old for Netherlands where he joined Ajax Amsterdam s U-21 team in 2008. Two years later he was shipped to Lierse SK of Belgium before moving to Poland s Lech Poznan in 2013.Wits are also assessing Chippa United midfielder Thamisanqa Sangweni who has been training with the club.sithembisod@thenewage.co.za-Sithembiso Dindi
