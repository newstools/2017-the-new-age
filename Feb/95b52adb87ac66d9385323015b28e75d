The African Diaspora Forum (ADF) and the United Front (UF) have slammed Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba, accusing him of inciting violence in Rosettenville.At least 22 houses were burnt down by angry residents in the Johannesburg suburb on Saturday.In December, Mashaba told journalists that illegal immigrants got to South Africa criminally and should be treated as such . Following a meeting in the area on Thursday, Mashaba said he had been notified that foreign nationals were using girls as young as nine as prostitutes in drug houses.ADF chairperson Marc Gbaffou said a leader should not make inflammatory and divisive remarks. We have no intention of protecting any criminal and we don t condone any criminal activities. We re just concerned by Herman Mashaba s approach, which is a populist strategy, and if he continues to go to the public to make inflammatory remarks, it will incite violence. What is the proof that all the houses (used as drug dens) belong to Nigerians, Gbaffou said.UF chairperson for Johannesburg Trevor Ngwane said Mashaba was irresponsible. We absolutely condemn mayor Mashaba s xenophobic right-wing populism and blame him for the violence against our brothers and sisters in Rosettenville, Ngwane said.But mayoral committee spokesperson Tony Taverna-Turisan said Mashaba welcomed foreigners to the city and believed they had a role in growing the economy. At the same time, we will not accept lawlessness in our city and the rule of law must be maintained. We will not retract our views that everyone who is here should be here lawfully, Taverna-Turisan said.Yesterday, residents suspended protests and community leader Andile Tshem said they would march to Moffat View police station for a response to their memorandum.Residents accuse police of turning a blind eye to foreign nationals who allegedly illegally evict locals and turn their homes into drug and prostitution dens. South African people must not be living on the streets when foreigners are using houses as brothels, Tshem said.Gauteng community safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane, provincial police commissioner Deliwe de Lange and Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba, who are visiting Yeoville, Hillbrow, Mayfair and Rosettenville today, will hold a public meeting with the Rosettenville community to address some of the issues from the protest which took place last weekend in the area.Meanwhile, a man found in one of the houses set alight, is expected to appear in court today with eight others found with drugs.Police spokesperson Kay Makhubela said police would continue to monitor the situation while also tracing those who were involved in the protests.Joburg MMC Michael Sun said it was unacceptable for residents to take the law into their own hands and risk the safety of innocent bystanders .MTHOKOZISI DUBEmtokozisid@thenewage.co.za
