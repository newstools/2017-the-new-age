While 32 of the worst performing schools in Gauteng are private schools, the Department of Education has noted a growth in the overall number of private schools in the province.The mushrooming of private schools is attributed to the demand from parents who are prepared to pay a premium price to avoid placing their children in overcrowded public schools.In the 2016 matric results for an example, two of the schools that recorded a 0% pass rate in Gauteng were private schools Brain Trust College in Germiston and Vine Christian College in Gauteng west.Gauteng education department (GDE) spokesperson Oupa Bodibe confirmed to The New Age that as of December last year, the department recorded a staggering 871 private schools operating in Gauteng adding that overcrowding at public schools was one of the driving forces.Asked why there seemed to be a preference for private schools, a Grade 11 pupil who wished to remain anonymous said she made the switch from government to a private school out of a need for more attentive teaching. I was struggling with school work at public schools because whenever I faced a problem in a certain subject, it was a hurdle to get the teacher to help me and pay attention to me and my problem because of the large number of students in each class, the pupil said.Bodibe said in some instances, parents might resort to private schools as a result of a lack of space in nearby public schools. The Constitution provides for a right to choose and therefore, parents choose where they want to enrol their children, he said. However, the department has warned parents to be vigilant against unregistered private schools ahead of the 2017 school registration period.Bodibe warned parents to be vigilant and to use the department s call centre to verify the legitimacy of schools as there is an increasing number of unregistered private schools, especially during this school registration period.The department also said the fly-bynight schools, which swindle parents out of their hard-earned cash, take root at the beginning of the academic year. The prospective school would have a legitimate registration number issued by the department and it can be verified by the GDE call centre on 011 3550600, Bodibe said.While more Gauteng parents continued to opt for private education, private did not always translate to better.The department also warned parents about the high fees that come with private education. An average tuition fee in private primary schools in the province will set parents back R29 246.85 and in secondary schools R33 987.25 per annum.However, these fees pale in comparison to some other private schools in the province. The 2017 matric pupils at Roedean School for Girls, located in Houghton, will pay an annual fee of R121 393, while St Johns College, an all boys school also in Houghton will set parents back R124 618 per annum for tuition fees for grades 8 to12.Making the transition from public to private school education is likely to have an impact on the families pocket. When I went to a public school my fees were R950 per month and now my new school fees is around R7000 per month. It was a big change which led to certain adjustments, the Grade 11 pupil said.However, the pupil said she did not think a private school education would put her in good stead once she arrived in university. The only difference between the public and private school is the fact that the classes are smaller and you get more attention from the teacher and the school is smaller. We all get the same education and it all depends on one s academic ability, she said The Gauteng education department also encouraged parents to conduct thorough research and not be quick to dismiss public schools. The department would like to alert parents to make informed choices as there are good and under-performing private schools, Bodibe said.SIPHIWE MCHUNUprovinces@thenewage.co.za
