At least 1.2 million women in South Africa fall pregnant every year, but a mere 144000 are treated in public hospital.Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi announced this on Thursday as he briefed the media on details of the National Health Insurance White Paper.Motsoaledi argued that others believe the NHI was about forcing all people to use public hospital or to destroy private healthcare systems.&#8220;The NHI ensures all South Africans have access to quality health care. Such quality health care will be provided irrespective of socioeconomic status,&#8221; Motsoaledi said.Motsoaledi said disparities in coverage and treatment between the rich and the poor should be correct because these could not be sustained.&#8220;NHI requires a massive re-organisation of the current healthcare system,&#8221; Motsoaledi said.Meanwhile, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa told the National Health Education &amp; Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) conference delegates to ensure that the proposed National Health Insurance succeeded.&#8220;You must give it legs, you must give it the engine that it requires. You are the ones who are supposed to make sure that we deliver the best healthcare service for all our people. It is on your shoulders, Ramaphosa said.Motsoaledi stated that once the NHI is passed, every single person would be part of it.-TNA Reporter
