Judge Dennis Davis says he will not recuse himself from the tax commission he heads because he has not discredited the South African Revenue Services.He denied he said the things he is being accused of and claimed that this whole matter was part of a bigger ploy &#8211; but would not elaborate.On Friday SARS hit out at the head of tax commission saying that the relationship between Judge Davis and SARS has been intolerably and irretrievably broken down .This is was as a result of a speech that Davis gave at a conference on tax evasion and illicit financial flows organised by the Alternative Information Development Centre last weekend. The details of his speech were published in City Press.According to the articles Judge Davis is reported to have alleged that the biggest challenge facing South Africa today is an erosion of the integrity of SARS , that the organisation had not capacity to deal with multinational corporations and capital that evade tax, that the wealthy are evading tax and the SARS is disingenuous to blame an expected shortfall of tax revenue on the economy.Judge Davis said he would not recuse himself because he was appointed by the Finance Minister.He said, in an interview with ANN7, that he hoped that things would be clarified and there would be no strain on the relationship between him and SARS.Judge Davis said he had reported the matter to Minister Pravin Gordhan and it was up to the FM what he intends to do with it .Davis said he would always rally behind the government to collect as much revenue from its people as possible and he will continue doing so .He explained he was heading the tax commission without being paid.Hitting out at SARS for going to the media before coming to him for clarification he said it would have been better for it to verify the information before acting on it.Judge Davis says he wishes he could get a chance to sit with the commissioner behind closed doors and discuss this so that the truth comes out .He added that while he was now aware that there were people who were dismissed from SARS at the conference but emphatically denied he was colluding with anybody to destroy the integrity of the tax collection agency.-TNA Reporter
