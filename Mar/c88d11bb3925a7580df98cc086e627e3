Tanzania on Saturday agreed to send 500 doctors to Kenya after a 100-day doctors&#8217; strike that paralyzed health services in the neighbouring country.President John Magufuli announced the decision after meeting a Kenyan delegation in Dar es Salaam headed by health minister Cleopa Mailu.&#8221;The difficulties of Kenya are the difficulties of Tanzania. We agree to send you these 500 doctors to provide care to our brothers,&#8221; Magafuli said in a statement.Some 5,000 doctors at Kenya&#8217;s public hospitals stopped working in December to demand better pay and conditions. The strike only ended on Tuesday.&#8221;As you assure me that you will pay the required salaries to my doctors and give them housing, that they will work in good conditions, I have no problem,&#8221; Magufuli said.There was no information as to when the doctors would be deployed or how long they would stay in Kenya.But Tanzania&#8217;s health minister Umy Mwalimu said the doctors would be sent to Kenya &#8220;as soon as possible&#8221;.Some Kenyan doctors are yet to return to work despite an agreement with the government, and medical workers are struggling to deal with the backlog of patients.-AFP
