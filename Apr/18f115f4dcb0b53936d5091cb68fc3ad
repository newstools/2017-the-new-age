Baroka FC co-coach Milton Dlamini is adamant his team will avoid the drop come the end of the season.Bakgaga are propping up the log with 21 points from 23 games and were beaten 3-1 by Maritz &#8211; burg United in their last game, in Pietermaritzburg. But with six matches remain &#8211; ing, Dlamini has targeted nine points for the Limpopo side to survive. Firstly, let me point out that some of our senior players didn t come to the party against Mar &#8211; itzburg. We have to work on their mentality and correct some of the mistakes we committed. For us the realistic target of points we are looking at achieve &#8211; ing to survive is nine points. Look, we are not going to win all our six games but there are some we feel we stand a good chance to claim something from, Dlamini said. With Orlando Pirates up next in Soweto, Dlamini said his boys would be highly motivated. Against the so-called big teams, Baroka have risen to the occasion. They milked two points off Kaizer Chiefs, drew against Pirates and upset Super &#8211; Sport United in Limpopo. When you are down there it doesn t matter who are you playing, it s about yourself, how much you want to get out of the situation down there. We will give it our best shot against Pirates. Asked about the future of former Pirates attacker Helder Pelembe, who has not cracked it at the club, Dlamini said he was still very much in their plans. The Mozambican needed to work hard in training to con &#8211; vince the technical team to pick him for games, Dlamini said.-Linda Ximba|sports@thenewage.co.za
