KwaZulu-Natal s bid to become champions of the upcoming National Rural Sport Development competition has received a major boost with two traditional leaders pledging to play a role in ensuring that the desired goal is realised.During the KZN Rural Sport Development competition held at KwaMnqobokazi in Hluhluwe on the north coast of KZN at the weekend, inkosi Nathi Maphumulo called on the provincial government to entrust the role of searching and unearthing rural talent to traditional leaders.He said the amakhosi were best placed to do so because not only are they the most influential figures to rural youth but they also know their people, their skills and talents. Besides being closer and influential to our youth, traditional leaders are also sport fanatics, chief Maphumulo said.Maphumulo, the chief of the uMdumezulu clan, in the Mbumbulu on the KZN s south coast, is the chairperson of the former National First Division side, Nathi Lions.He called for the representation of the traditional leaders on the provincial government sport portfolio committee.During the award-giving ceremony, Maphumulo told the youth to choose sport as a positive outlet for their energies rather than dabble in negative activities and behaviour that many young people were courting these days. This is a golden opportunity for you to establish your names through sport. Please take advantage of it, because it could be your future. The competitions involve different sporting codes. The competing teams were from uMdumezulu clan and the Mnqobokazi clan.Inkosi Sabelo Ngwane of the Mnqobokazi clan praised the rural sport development programme. He said the project was good enough in the campaign to rescue youths from drugs.He also pledged to do whatever it took to make sure that the goals of the programme were achieved.He warned the youth against substance abuse: I am not expecting to hear anything to do with youth involvement with drugs, Ngwane said.He further encouraged the youth to work harder to excel in the upcoming national event held in Polokwane in July. The victors of the national event will be awarded with a state of the art multi-purpose sport facility.Manager of the Cub Development, Jay Mannikan, expressed his pleasure at the support of the amakhosi.TNA REPORTERprovinces@thenewage.co.za
