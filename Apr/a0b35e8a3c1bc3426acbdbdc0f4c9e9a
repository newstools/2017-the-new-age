 NGICELA uNgixolele (Please forgive me) were the last words of five-year old Rikson Mongwe, who was fatally stabbed by a 21-year-old man who drank his blood in what is believed to be a satanic attack.The child had been pleading for mercy for whatever had made his attacker angry, a neighbour told The New Age yesterday.His parents have been left traumatised and angry after the horrific incident on Monday afternoon in Orlando East, Soweto.Rikson s hysterical mother, Rosinah Mosiuoa said the man who killed her child was sent by the devil.She said she was at work when a relative came crying and they called her to go home with them. When I got home I found people gathered outside my yard and my son lying on the ground in a pool of blood, I just ran out of strength and fell down. I am really broken and depressed it feels like I am about to go crazy, I don t know why this is happening to me, Mosiuoa said. Some of the neighbours who knew the suspect said they were shocked because they knew him as a sane person.According to neighbours, the suspect was behaving strangely as he slaughtered a black chicken and drank its blood then moved on to the street where he saw kids playing. He returned home to fetch a knife. What we saw was traumatic, he started by saying he was craving for blood in a strange voice while he stabbed the child and held him up to drink his blood, he had changed into something like a beast because he overpowered people who tried to get him off the boy, the neighbour said.The neighbours said they were afraid and now feared for their own kids who play in the street.The father of the child, Edward Mongwe, recalled how he was called by neighbours to come and see what had happened to his son. I was called by community members and I ran to the street only to find that my son was murdered by someone I knew. I just went crazy and did not know what to do, Mongwe said.Police spokesperson Kay Makhubela said it was alleged that the 21 year old came across children playing in the street and grabbed the five year old and stabbed him in his neck and then drank his blood. The five year old was stabbed to death, the suspect was assaulted by the community before he was arrested. He is now in hospital and will be appearing in court soon, Makhubela said.DIKELEDI RAMABOPA
