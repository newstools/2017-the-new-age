Some Hispanic business owners in the United States are offering to help build President Donald Trump&#8217;s wall to keep out unauthorized immigrants on the Mexican border, despite controversy and their personal misgivings.&#8220;Myself, being an Hispanic makes it tougher,&#8221; Michael Luera, who runs a construction services firm in Ganado, Texas, told AFP.His company, Fairfield Logistics, recently expressed interest in working on the border wall project, which has become a lightning rod for public outrage in the debate over Trump&#8217;s immigration policies.But it was not an easy choice.&#8220;When this controversy targets all the Mexicans, that really affects me because I know that a lot of them are not bad people and come here to work hard,&#8221; said Luera, himself a third-generation American of Mexican descent.&#8211; &#8216;You can&#8217;t ignore it&#8217; &#8211;For him as for many others, the chance to win a piece of the massive project, valued at between $8 billion and $40 billion, tips the balance in favor of bidding on the wall.&#8220;Essentially, it&#8217;s a business decision,&#8221; said Mario Burgos, head of a New Mexico construction company. &#8220;Obviously, when we see an opportunity in our backyard, you can&#8217;t ignore it.&#8221;&#8220;I see the wall as kind of good neighbors putting up fences,&#8221; he said, but added, &#8220;I&#8217;m always uncomfortable with everything that is anti-immigrant.&#8221;While details remain scarce, the project already has drawn the interest of major companies such as the Franco-Swiss cement maker LafargeHolcim, which, like its Mexican rival Cemex, says it is ready to supply materials for &#8220;all types of infrastructure projects&#8221; in the United States.In all, nearly 650 businesses of all sizes, including 66 identified as Hispanic-American owned, answered a February 24 &#8220;pre-solicitation&#8221; call from the Department of Homeland Security, which is expected on Wednesday to issue a formal request for proposals.Still, some businesses are clearly more reticent.Irish building materials firm CRH said it would not be involved because the project was not &#8220;in our interest.&#8221;During the Super Bowl, the Pennsylvania building supply company 84 Lumber aired a television commercial showing workers installing a large door in a border wall to allow a mother and daughter into the United States.Some small- and medium-sized American business owners, however, say there is no reason for a guilty conscience.One, who spoke on condition of anonymity, claiming there were &#8220;a lot of crazy people out there,&#8221; said he wanted to &#8220;serve my country&#8221; by contributing to a project that would block the arrival of unauthorized immigrants.&#8220;I&#8217;m a Hispanic but I&#8217;m American above all and I want to make sure that everybody obeys the laws,&#8221; said the fourth-generation American business owner.&#8220;If I have to go to war and kill somebody, I&#8217;m just doing my job,&#8221; said the business owner, a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.&#8220;If the government needs contractors to build this wall, I&#8217;m just doing my job.&#8221;&#8211; &#8216;Aware of the issues&#8217; &#8211;Marc Uribe, who works at a California construction company, downplayed the dilemma, veering into irony.&#8220;Oh really? There&#8217;s a controversy?&#8221; asked Uribe. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know there was anybody unhappy about the wall. Who&#8217;s that?&#8221;Joe Moreno, who runs contracting business in Arizona with his brother Alfonso, said construction projects are by nature subject to dispute.&#8220;With every project, be it a nuclear plant, a freeway, an airport parking lot, a downtown new development building, there&#8217;s always a controversy,&#8221; he said.&#8220;If we had to avoid every controversial project, we would be out of work.&#8221;Moreno also said businesses had to bid for a piece of the project because &#8220;it pays the bills&#8221; and added that his Hispanic heritage would be an advantage in a project that straddled cultures north and south of the border.&#8220;We&#8217;re well aware of issues that can arise on both sides of the borders. We understand the customs and the languages from both sides of the border.&#8221;-AFP
