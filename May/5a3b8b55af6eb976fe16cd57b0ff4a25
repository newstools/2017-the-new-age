More than 1 200 Eastern Cape children have benefitted from a nursery rhymes educational programme that explores learning through rhymes and songs.The programme, hosted in Humansdorp at the weekend, was attended by local early childhood development (ECD) practitioners and children from 20 different centres and was part of the National Mother Goose Day celebrations.Marion Green-Thompson, economic development director of Jeffrey s Bay wind farm which funded the programme, said: Rhymes and songs promote a sense of identity and belonging. It enriches children s language skills and sharpens their ability to identify sounds, which is an essential skill for later reading.Every culture and language has traditional rhymes and songs that are passed down the generations and these can be used to promote children s learning and development. The programme explores rhymes and songs in celebration of the children s unique culture and language and has enriched more than 1 200 children from Humansdorp, Jeffrey s Bay, Oyster Bay, St Francis, Thornhill, Patensie and Hankey.It also promotes concepts of numeracy and enhances physical development through movement.Green-Thompson said the programme was established to bring awareness to and encourage the use of reading in preschool environments through stories and nursery rhymes, after it was determined that fairy tales were important in the reading development. Tales are important in all cultures. They introduce concepts of fantasy and challenge us to be better by considering the moral implications of our actions, Green-Thompson said.He said fairy tales and rhymes are fundamentally the first introduction to reading for young people everywhere.The South African programme is aptly named The wonderful world of nursery rhymes/Die wonderlike wereld van rympies/Izicengcelezo ezimnandi zabantwana abancinane to make this celebration more accessible and truly local.In 1987, it was determined that fairy tales were essential to reading development and a day needed to be established to bring awareness of, and encourage the use of reading in preschool environments through stories and nursery rhymes.Mother Goose Day is celebrated annually around the world in the month of May. According to the Mother Goose Society, Mother Goose Day was founded by Gloria Delamar in 1987 in tandem with the publication of her book, Mother Goose: From Nursery to Literature.ANGEL MAHLOprovinces@thenewage.co.za
