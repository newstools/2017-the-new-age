THE Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries has placed a general ban on the sale of live hens across the country following an outbreak of the H5N8 bird flu at a farm owned by poultry producer Astral in Villiers in the Free State.This comes after avian flu was first reported in Zimbabwe on June 2. The company said the farm had been quarantined and the affected site would be depleted of all birds. Astral assures all stakeholders that everything is being done to contain this incident.If this incident is contained to that specific site and farm, Astral s contingency plans ensure continued operations with no impact, Astral managing director of agriculture Gary Arnold said.The South African Veterinary Authority has been notified of high mortalities of a breeder flock in Villiers and the department has decided to euthanise the birds in affected houses in collaboration with the NSPCA. The affected property has 12 selfcontained sites with about 285 000 birds. So far, only one self-contained site with about 24000 birds has been affected, the department said. The farm has been placed under quarantine and veterinary services will continue to monitor it.KUTULLO MADISHA
