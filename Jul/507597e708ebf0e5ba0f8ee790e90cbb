Metrorail train services operating between Vereeniging via Midway to Johannesburg is set to resume on Tuesday. “The first phase of re-introduction services in this corridor was successfully implemented two weeks ago following intensive stakeholder engagements and was fully supported by commuters where trains were turned at Midway station,” said Metrorail spokesperson Lillian Mofokeng. Last month, Metrorail services suspended the train services last month following violent protests in Nancefield which claimed two lives. A Metrorail employee, Joseph Koena, was stoned to death. This followed disruption and chaos by protesters who claimed that the rail security guards had been responsible for the shooting and killing of a 17-year-old boy during a service delivery protest march in Nancefield, Soweto, at the weekend. Metrorail disputed claims that their protection services officers carry guns, and so their employees cannot be held responsible for the death of the 17-year-old boy. “We do not give our own protection services officials guns. So, we will allow the police and investigators to help us to understand where that allegation is coming from,” Mofokeng said. -TNA Reporter
