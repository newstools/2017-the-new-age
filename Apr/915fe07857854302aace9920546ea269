As the local community bade an emotional farewell to Rackson Tinyiko Mongwe, 5, his suspected killer is expected to appear in the local magistrate s court on Tuesday.The local community has been shocked and angered by the brutality of the killing of Mongwe, who was stabbed to death with a knife not far from his home. It s alleged that the killer subsequently drank the boys blood in the presence of his nine-year-old sibling, Khensani.The 21-year-old suspect, who was the boy s neighbour, faces a murder charge, police spokesperson Capt Kay Makhubele said. I can confirm that a charge of murder has been laid against the man. The suspect will appear at the Orlando Magistrate s Court on April 25, Makhubele said.A family relative, Mankoase Kolosoa, said: The incident caused pain and tears in the family. Mongwe s death seemed to have been committed by a demonic man. Kolosoa wants justice to run its course and for the court to consider that a young innocent soul had his life cut short by the gruesome act of violence when passing sentence.The funeral of the pupil from Lereshe Primary School, Orlando East, took place at the weekend, at the Orlando Communal Hall.At the funeral, the school representative s expressed their outrage at the loss of a young lovable boy.The boy s distraught father, Eddie Mongwe, had to be carried in and out of the service, shaking his head in shock and disbelief while tears welled in his eyes.Kolosoa said the community was supportive and that in part it had borne the funeral costs.Local councillor Sechaba Khumalo and community safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane expressed condolences to the boy s loved ones.Chairperson of the CPF of Greater Orlando, Dumisani Twala, said: We hope this incident will encourage the residents to unite and continue to support the family and to closely follow the court proceedings. Crime in Greater Orlando is rife and has prompted the CPF to prioritise the protection of women and children. The revival of block and street committees are some of the ideas proposed to fight the scourge of crime. Twala said his organisation would ensure that children and women were protected.Refilwe Magashuleprovinces@thenewage.co.za
