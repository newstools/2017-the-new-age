The South African Policing Union has slammed the move by management to re-enlist former police officers, saying there was no sustainable future for the South African Police Service (SAPS) if it goes ahead with re-enlisting former officers while it ignores the majority of youth who are unemployed. The proposal of the SAPS is something we have been against since its initiation by the then national police commissioner Riah Phiyega. This whole thing does not make sense, you cannot recall officers and give them the same rank that they held before their departure. This would result in a demoralised workforce, the union s general secretary Oscar Skommere said.Sekomere also objected to the ex-cops being appointed at the rank they had held before their departure. This has created discomfort and demoralised the workforce, basically when you resign as a colonel or captain you still get the same although you have been out of the police. The SAPS announced its intension to re-enlist ex-cops on Friday and yesterday it placed adverts in prominent newspapers calling on former members from the ranks of constable, sergeant or warrant officers who comply with requirements, to apply for vacant posts in the police service in all nine provinces.Police spokesperson Sally de Beer said: the focus of the re-enlistment process will be to improve capacity in different SAPS environments, focusing on commercial crime units, organised crime units, detective units at police stations, family violence, child protection and sexual offences units, forensic social workers, intelligence gatherers, crime information officers, police stations, 10111 centres, K9 units, public order policing, mounted units and generic support. She said those re-employed would be remunerated on the minimum salary notch applicable to their relevant rank .Acting SAPS national commissioner Lesetja Mothiba had approved this process, which however, excluded former members who had retired.KUTULLO MADISHA AND REFILWE MAGASHULEkutullom@thenewage.co.za
