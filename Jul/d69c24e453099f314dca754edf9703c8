BABY Proteas coach Dorette Badenhorst believes the group of players representing the country at the U-21 Netball World Cup, which starts on Saturday in Gaborone, are capable making the semifinals. South Africa is ranked fifth at the tournament and have been mandated by the sport s officials to better the ranking from four years ago in Australia when they finished in fifth place.Netball SA president Mimi Mthethwa said they expected the group to better that position. The Proteas have been drawn in pool B together with Barbados, Zimbabwe, Singapore and one of the tournament s favourites, Australia.Badenhorst, who was also the coach at the 2013 tournament, said the team shared the same goal as NSA. We are always up for the challenge. I think if we can play good netball and keep possession we are in there with a good chance because we have a great group of players. And yes, we want to be in the top four and play in the semifinals of the tournament. I really hope that this team can make it. Badenhorst s side will begin their campaign against Barbados on Saturday. The last time the two sides met in the tournament, South Africa defeated Barbados in the fifth place playoff match. Proteas are favourites to win their first match but Badenhorst said her players must avoid any complacency. I think that every country is good. There will be no easy games so we really need to prepare for each game, she said. Australia, New Zealand, England and Jamaica will be the four favourites but we also need to break through somehow. With good preparation and planning we can do that. I think the Brutal Fruit Premier League was a great preparation for the players to get used to playing on a high level because of that kind of intensity, the physical part will there at the World Cup. The Proteas will play their neighbours Zimbabwe in their second match.sithembisod@thenewage.co.za-Sithembiso Dindi
