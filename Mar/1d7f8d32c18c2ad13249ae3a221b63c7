A YOUNG mother convicted of murdering her baby on Christmas Day 2014, was given a long jail term by the Tzaneen Regional Court last week. Malehu Linah Molete, 26, strangled her eight-month-old baby boy Kamogelo at her parent s home at Motsinoni village, the court heard. The court on February 28 found her guilty of murder and sentenced her to 15 years imprisonment without the option of a fine. Meanwhile, provincial health department advised mothers with unwanted children to approach social workers for intervention. An unwanted pregnancy which is beyond second trimester is also the case of social workers for further interventions such as adoption. If the unwanted pregnancy is less than 20 weeks, the mother will be referred to a relevant hospital for termination of pregnancy (TOP), department spokesperson Derick Kganyago said. If the pregnancy poses a risk to the mother or the unborn baby it would be the decision of doctors on a termination as stated by the TOP Act of 1996, Kganyago said. In another incident a 28-year-old man found guilty of raping a six-year-old girl, was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Tzaneen Regional Court o last Tuesday. Police said the man, who could not be named to protect the identity of the raped child, found her at the village, dragged her into the bush and raped her repeatedly June 29, 2014. Another 28-year-old man was last week sentenced to a 10-year prison sentence by the Groblersdal Regional Court for raping a 16-year-old girl at Ga-Matsepe in Tafelkop. He found the girl talking to her older sister in the street and threatened them with a firearm, on March 22, 2015. He then dragged the younger girl into the bush where he raped her. Police management welcomes the two sentences and also commends detectives for the hard work they have put in, resulting in the long jail terms, police spokesperson Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe said.
