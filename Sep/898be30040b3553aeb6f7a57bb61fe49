The Commission s investigation, launched in February this year, revealed the furniture removal companies agreed under the auspices of the NPPMA to add a levy of R350 to the amount they charged to their customers transporting furniture on Gauteng highways that have e-tolls. The purpose of the agreement was to pass on to consumers the added costs incurred when transporting furniture using highways in Gauteng because of e-tolls. The agreement has been in existence at least since January 22, 2014 and is ongoing. The Commission is seeking an order that the companies and the NPPMA contravened the Competition Act. In addition, the Commission seeks an order that they all be held liable to pay an administrative penalty equivalent to 10% of their respective annual turnover.
