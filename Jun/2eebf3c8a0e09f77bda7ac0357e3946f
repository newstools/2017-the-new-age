The ANC in the Western Cape Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) leadership has urged the National Executive Committee (NEC) to intervene on the escalating division within different regions ahead policy conference.Five regions of the PEC leadership pleaded with the ruling party to intervene and fight the division within the Western Cape ANC before it is too late.The group comprising leaders of the Cape Town metro, Boland, Overberg, West Coast and Central regions held a press briefing in Cape Town on Sunday.The leadership blamed ANC NEC member Derek Hanekom and regional secretary Faize Jacobs for creating some severance.Western Cape ANC Deputy Secretary Thandi Manyikivana said they are tired with the way things are conducted.&#8220;We are tired of the paganism and the way that the PEC has been conducting business of the organisation in the Western Cape,&#8221; she said.Manyikivana said that the PEC leadership was never consulted on the outcome of the NEC list and were never included in the process.Among other issues was the collapse of the policy conference that was held in Stellenbosch which did not follow proper processes of the ANC.It is reported that there was a PEC meeting that concluded business without communicating with other members of what should happen next.Chairperson of the Dular Omar region, Xolani Sotashe said they cannot fold arms when the organisation is going down.&#8220;We as Dular Omar region we indicated to the national leadership of the ANC that things are not well in the Western Cape.&#8220;There is a problem of factionalism in the organisation that must be routed out, we have a problem of people who think that they own the ANC,&#8221; said Sotashe.It is believed that the province has been struggling with leadership for over a year, after the NEC declared in June last year that the PEC should be disbanded and caretakers be put in place.Sotashe added that they are not going to keep quite when the organisation is being violated by certain individuals and the reality is that we have a weak leadership in the Western Cape.He also accused Leaders like Khaya Magaxa, Faize Jacobs and Thandi Manyikivana of dividing them instead of uniting them.Meanwhile Marius Fransman has called on Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to distance himself from thuggery done in his name in Western Cape. I always maintain that the attack on me was because of my strongest views against monopoly capital, and my statement in the September NEC 2015 that we have uncovered a plot of leaders trying to sabotage ANC and working with the opposition, said Fransman.Fransman said he highlighted in that meeting that Hanekom and UiD faction role as they are a group of people led by a convicted fraudster, Jonton Snyman. After they used Luthuli House to try and get rid of me so they can dictate through fraud and corruption delegates to ANC National Conference December 2017, they still couldn&#8217;t penetrate regions and branches, he said.TNA Reporter
