It is no exaggeration to say that people died to ensure that we live in a country where we have a wonderful Constitution that guarantees freedom of expression and all that goes with that very important right.Journalists, editors and media organisations that took on the might of the apartheid security apparatus were heavily persecuted, tortured and even hounded to death by a regime hell-bent on suppressing the truth at all costs.When the oppressive regime came to an end we thought we could all breathe a sigh of relief and enjoy complete freedom of the media.However, having achieved this wonderful state of affairs, we have realised that the beautiful words in our Constitution are principles that we have to fight for every day and that there will always be people who try to trample on the rights of others to get their points across.Take for example the recent decision by members of the Black First Land First grouping to assemble outside the residence of veteran editor Peter Bruce. Or the decision by the Economic Freedom Fighters to threaten reporters from The New Age and ANN7. These are just two ways in which press freedom has been placed under attack recently.If we look at the utterances of members of Sanef and the behaviour of so-called liberal political parties like the DA, we find that onslaughts on freedom of expression are increasing rapidly.We need to step back from this abyss urgently. Press freedom is sacred and we have no right to intimidate people whatever their views are; they should be free to express them without fear or favour as long as they act within the very reasonable laws of the land.
