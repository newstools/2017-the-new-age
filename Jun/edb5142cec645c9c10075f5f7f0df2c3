ORLANDO Pirates have drawn up a list of players deemed surplus to requirements as they look to offload the excess weight .The process is set to begin soon after the Nedbank Cup final against SuperSport United in Durban this weekend, with no less than five players, including Donald Mokondelela, Thembelani Sikhakhane and Sello Japhta, facing the exit door.But the clear out could be overshadowed by Steven Pienaar s potential transfer to the Buccaneers in the off-season. Such a move wouldn be the first of its kind as a host of overseasbased players have returned home to join clubs mostly able to match their obscene salaries over the years.Yet this one could be the first high profile transfer since Benni McCarthy and former Arsenal striker Luis Boa Morte joined Bucs after the 2010 World Cup. Pienaar, who has spent 10 years in the English Premier League, more than dropped a hint as he remarked on the speculation linking him with local PSL sides, with his contract at Sunderland coming to an end next week. Obviously every player wants to play for a team (Orlando Pirates) that they supported as a kid, but then this is not all up to me, Pienaar said. Cape Town City? It could be possible because I know the city well and I have a lot of friends there. I know John (Comitis) very well and Benni (McCarthy) is like a big brother to me, so if he wants me he knows where to get me.&nbsp;However, as I ve said it s not all up to me, but up to the clubs. I can t go to the clubs and say sign me . I am just a player and if they want me then they will speak to my manager. I ve told my family and my manager that I want to move to South Africa. I said to him listen, if you get a club elsewhere I will think about it, but first make sure that you find a club in SA . Pienaar, however, did not rule out the possibility of returning to the Dutch Eredivisie where his European career began more than 10 years ago.kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za&nbsp;
