South Africa&#8217;s Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI) has on Thursday arrested further seven licensing centre officials, on charges of fraud and corruption.The officials were arrested earlier in the morning at their respected place of work. It is reported that four of the suspects are from the Martindale Bulk Licensing Department, while the remaining three are from the Langlaagte Licensing Department.Today s arrest follows 70 officials who were suspended for corruption last week. Two weeks ago, the city of Johannesburg together with the Hawks arrested seven officials for fraud and corruption in Midrand, Randburg, Marlboro, Roodepoort, Langlaagte, and Martindale.Meanwhile, City of Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba said the city was working closely with the law enforcement agencies and residents in making sure that they curb corruption. Working closely with the Hawks, SAPS, the Prosecuting Authority, JMPD and the residents of this City, we&#8217;ll continue to wage war on corruption. I would also like to ask our residents for patience while we continue to rid our licensing centres of corrupt officials, Mashaba added.He also said the Municipality hired an additional 40 new staff members, and had also took some employees from the department to assist in delivering service to the people.-Sipho Jack
