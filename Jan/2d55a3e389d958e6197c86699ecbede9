Cycling data shows that about 1% of all trips in Cape Town are made by bicycle.Yesterday, the city said it had committed substantial resources over the past eight years to pursuing the vision of a cycling-friendly city.Cyclists have access to at least 450km of cycle lanes across the city, some of which are separate from the road.The city s Transport and Urban Development Authority (TDA) has published a draft cycling strategy which aims to increase the percentage of commuter trips made by bicycle from the current 1% to 8% by 2030.Inclusive of the draft strategy is a proposal for a bicycle manufacturing plant in Cape Town. Although some of these lanes are popular for recreational cycling, we still have not seen the growth in commuter cycling which is required to have a noticeable impact on traffic congestion, greenhouse gas emissions and to improve mobility in the lower-income areas, the city s mayoral committee member for transport, Brett Herron, said.He said they needed a new approach, together with some key interventions from both the city and the private sector to realise their goal to increase the percentage of bicycle commuter trips to 8% within the next 13 years. I invite residents and interested and affected parties to read this document and to submit their suggestions on how we can turn Cape Town into a top cycling city, Herron said.Last year the TDA s planning department conducted a status quo assessment of cycling in Cape Town.The research included surveys of cycling movements at 50 locations across the city, an assessment of the available cycle facilities, a review of incident data involving cyclists and engagements with relevant stakeholders. Despite the popularity of recreational cycling and participation in cycling events like the annual Cape Town Cycle Tour, the uptake of utility cycling remained stagnant for the past decade, Herron said.He said the surveys conducted confirmed that more than 500 utility cyclists cycled to work in the morning peak period. These surveys confirm that commuters either do or will cycling but that the majority of residents cannot afford bicycles. Given the fact that low-income transport users in Cape Town spend up to 45% of their monthly household income on transport, while the international norm is between 5% and 10%, cycling is an affordable alternative provided that we improve access to bicycles in these communities, Herron said.He said the biggest potential for growing utility cycling lay in bicycle trips to railway and bus stations. If provided with the necessary facilities for safe storage, we are confident that commuters will use bicycles to ride to the closest public transport station from where they can complete the rest of their commute either by bus or train, he said.Herron said cycling gave commuters more flexibility. They could depart as and when they felt like it and did not have to wait for public transport.ntombin@thenewage.co.za
