The first time I saw the Elite Slice, I fell in love with it not just for its looks but for what it does. The Elite Slice is designed for business and office use, and its base model s specs echo that. The purpose of the HP Elite Slice is to get the PC back onto your desk.Moving on from tower PCs, the Slice wants to put everything in front of you at a reach of your hand, in a slickly designed package. The main unit has a remarkable resemblance to the Mac Mini. It s a flattened squirkle, but one of the exciting things about the design is the copper venting that runs around it. Copper is very much the tech colour.The main body will offer you Core i3, i5 or i7 processors and a host of physical rear connectivity HDMI, Display Port, Ethernet, USB-C, USB but with options for a different top cover. The flattened top isn t just somewhere to be gathering dust, it can be a wireless charger for your phone, or you can opt for the collaboration cover, bringing your call controls to the top of your PC in handy reach.It s begging for media controls, but with business being the first consideration, we guess that audio isn t. With the HP Audio Module2, you can convert your HP Elite Slice into a speakerphone or a multimedia player with bidirectional HP noise cancellation, a dual-microphone array, three speakers and HP audio boost.Snap the optional HP ODD module to the HP Elite Slice with an integrated USB-type connection 3 that provides a simple, cable-less solution. This is about innovative design. It s a good looking PC and one that will revamp any desk and help us move out of the post-tower era.-Indie Boyce|indiphileb@thenewage.co.za
