 Apartheid debt to the Reserve Bank must be recovered, public prosecutor Busisiwe Mkhwebane saysFriday January the 13th, was an unlucky day for monopoly capitalists in South Africa.Our nation woke up to find a damning headline on the front page of the Mail &amp;Guardian, which read Absa s Apartheid Debt: public protector says state must recover billions from bank .The outlet shared the news that a preliminary report by public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane had been leaked and that it condemns the lifeboat payment made to Absa by the Reserve Bank during the apartheid era. The payment, worth much more than R2bn, was justified as a bailout to keep the struggling Absa afloat.The reality is that the payment was completely and utterly illegal, acting to prop up the economic crime structures that have allowed the historically advantaged economic institutions of our nation to flourish.It is a large, earth-shattering revelation that is reverberating through the national and international press, despite those connected to the banks efforts to minimise the issue.It is also something that our government has been looking into since 1997, through British asset recovery firm Ciex.Recently, many of us have been concentrating our rage on Thuli Madonsela s state capture claims, yet have completely ignored Madonsela s concurrent investigation and the skeletons lurking in the monopoly capital closet.In 2011, the public protector began her work looking into apartheid s financial crimes. In the time since, Madonsela has dithered and procrastinated so much that it was still not completed more than five years later when she left office.The work simply wasn t a priority because it did not suit the pro-monopoly capital agenda to go rooting through dirty laundry that was, this time, close to home.Back in April 2016, The New Age reported on our nation s Amnesia on apartheid looting . As a nation, we have allowed ourselves to become distracted by a pantomime of misplaced blame, when the real heart of our issues has been in front of us all along.A ditherer supreme she may be, but at least Madonsela set the ball rolling on one of the Ciex Report thefts before she left.Thank goodness Mkhwebane has proven to be the hare to Madonsela s tortoise and given the investigation some momentum. South Africa has amnesia no longer.Absa is disputing Mkhwebane s claims.But even if it is going to pay back R2.25bn of the money, this figure will have minimal impact upon their company finances or share price. So everything at Absa is business as usual .Absa must not be allowed to weasel out of the allegations against it.I believe that the impact of the bank s failure to pay the interest on the bailout is valued at much more than R2.25bn.The 25 worth of inflation and interest must be factored in, as with any loan, if even a fraction of the true debt is to be repaid.Barclays, which now owns Absa, has a market cap of about R145bn and R2.25bn is a mere drop in the ocean to a company of this size, whereas the losses that the South African people have endured go much further.In a nation as divided as ours, we must ensure that Absa is made to properly accountable for its amnesia and pay us all back in full at 2017 rates, ensuring that the company feels the financial impact of its actions.This will be the only way to set the proper precedent for the other cases soon to follow.And there will be more.If the Ciex report is correct, there is a further R24bn of looted money for the public protector to investigate. Offering helpful directions, Ciex claims that this money can now be located in the pockets of executives at some of the country s major companies.Our country is one of the most divided in the world. We live with a massive gulf in living standards between the haves and the have nots and an economic system that doesn t mirror the political liberation of 1994.The haves, in the form of monopoly capitalists, cannot face the thought of looking in the mirror at the genesis of their wealth and how it was accumulated. Not only is there hard evidence of theft and corruption, but as a country the healing process of apartheid is still far from complete.For too long we have allowed criminals to benefit from a historical advantage that has condemned so many of our society to poverty.From an economic perspective, looking back to the wrongs of yesterday is just part of the journey required for our country to grow and create jobs tomorrow. Looking back for the benefit of the future will be painful, and some sacred cows may have reputations tarnished or even ruined.But it is necessary; both morally and in terms of the law.The organisations named have the finances to pay their debts back in full, not small insignificant fines and need to feel the impact of their actions.We cannot let these people dodge the bullet with minimal inconvenience yet again, as has been made possible by monopoly capitalism until now.The money that South Africa is owed can be recovered in full. This will help us take a step closer to wiping monopoly capital s stain of control off our economy for good.-Moegsien Williams is the editor-in-chief of The New Age
