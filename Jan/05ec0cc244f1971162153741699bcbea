THE Western Cape is in the middle of its worst drought in years but one expert says future weather forecasts suggest the situation could be looking up.The city of Cape Town has warned dam levels, currently at about 42.5% capacity, could drop to 20% before the winter rains arrive.Environmental and geographical science academic Kevin Winter said he believed there was only enough water left for about 100 days. However, he said the situation could improve slightly in a few months if rains came. The long-term forecasts suggest we re moving towards slightly above average rainfall. That is what the South African Weather Service is tentatively reporting on, he said.In a statement, the city said it was working to implement more stringent level three water restrictions. The city approved level three water restrictions, which came into effect on November 1.Portable pools and garden hoses have been prohibited under level three water restrictions, while the city has strongly advised residents to install water efficient infrastructure in a bid to save as much water as possible.Water pressure is also set to be reduced in the water distribution system in a bid to limit underground leaks. But officials say consumption throughout Cape Town has increased yet again, despite warnings last week.Collective consumption for the week ending January 15 was up to 890 million litres a day. This is up from 859 million a a day the previous week, and is 90 million litres a day above targeted levels.The municipality is also in the process of identifying properties with excessive water use. The city said it would target these customers for inspections and water usage enforcement.Officials have called on residents to report water wastage via email, as the city continues with blitz operations to save water.
