Credit ratings agency Moody&#8217;s on Friday said it had downgraded South Africa a notch over gloomy growth prospects and the political instability.Africa&#8217;s most advanced economy was knocked down from Baa2 to Baa3 &#8212; one notch above junk status &#8212; with a negative outlook, Moody&#8217;s said in a statement.Fitch and Standard and Poor&#8217;s, the other two main global ratings agencies, already downgraded South Africa to junk status after Zuma&#8217;s shock purge of critical ministers in March, including respected finance minister Pravin Gordhan.Moody&#8217;s had delayed its decision but finally announced the downgrade Friday citing &#8220;the weakening of South Africa&#8217;s institutional framework&#8221; as well as worsening growth prospects and rising public debt, according to the agency&#8217;s vice president Zuzana Brixiova.The downgrade came after official statistics released Tuesday showed South Africa entering its first recession since 2009 after the economy unexpectedly contracted by 0.7 percent in the first quarter.South Africa has had sluggish growth for years, with record unemployment of more than 27 percent.&nbsp;AFP &nbsp;
