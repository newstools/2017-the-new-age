Last week was yet another bad one for the country s economy as the release of the latest GDP figures confirmed that we are now in a technical recession.News that ratings agency Moody s has also joined the party with yet another downgrade further contributed to the growing economic woes.Against this background, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba s briefing in Pretoria today on the way forward for the economy will be keenly observed. According to the national Treasury Gigaba is expected to reflect on the government s interventions to arrest the decline.Also today the Speaker of Parliament, Baleka Mbete, will be in Diepkloof, Soweto to open a debate on gender-based violence. The event, which will include youth organisations, churches and organisations representing abused women, has been arranged by IKO (Innovating Kasi Organisation), a Soweto-based, youth orientated nonprofit organisation.Tomorrow the National Assembly will hear political parties pay tribute to struggle icon, Rivonia trialist, Robben Island lifer and Nelson Mandela s friend, Ahmed Kathrada, who died aged 87 in March. Scheduled to follow the tributes is a debate on speeding up land reform by using the limitation clause in the Constitution to bypass the willing seller, willing buyer policy. Also scheduled is a debate on Africa Day.On Wednesday, two days before the country commemorates the June 16 uprisings of 1976, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa is scheduled to answer questions in the National Assembly.Six questions are waiting to be answered by Rampahosa, but there will be follow-ups in what is poised to be the highlight of a parliamentary week shortened by Friday s commemoration of June 16.Three of the questions for Ramaphosa are from the ANC, one is from the IFF, another is from the Freedom Front Plus, and the ACDP will also chip in with one. Topics that will be covered through the questions are state capture, genderbased violence and moral regeneration. ANC member of Parliament Mondli Gungubele has a question about public perceptions of corporate capture of state-owned enterprises.He wants to know how the government is planning to prevent the manifestation of corporate capture going forward? In his question, ACDP leader Kenneth Meshoe raised an issue about Ramaphosa s role as patron of the Moral Regeneration Movement.The reverend is inquiring if the deputy president has found that the ongoing political crisis in South Africa has been marked by an absence of ethical, moral and just leaders and if so, what contribution is he making to restore ethics and morals in politics and, in particular, in the government?Apart from Ramaphosa s highlight on Wednesday, another key event will be the portfolio committee on trade and industry s engagement with the national Treasury and the National Credit Regulator. This briefing will give an indication of the indebtedness of South Africans.On the same day, the South African Police Service and the civilian secretariat will appear before the police portfolio committee.Last week Police Minister Fikile Mbalula told the portfolio committee that he was disappointed and concerned about the secretariat. This matter is likely to be raised. A debate on Youth Day is scheduled for Thursday.On Friday, President Jacob Zuma will be in Ventersdorp, once the lair of the late Afrikanerweerstandsbeweging leader Eugene Terre Blanche, to deliver the keynote address on June 16 or National Youth Day as the momentous day is known in the South African calendar. The theme for this year is The Year of OR Tambo: Advancing Youth Economic Empowerment.DENNIS CRUYWAGENnews@thenewage.co.za
