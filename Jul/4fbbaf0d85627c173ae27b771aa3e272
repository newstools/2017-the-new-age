Reactionary forces are rearing their ugly heads in a robust fashion in our country, which faces serious polarisation in its social discourse.This occurs in a media space where anything less than the whole truth often passes as gospel. Political amnesia is also rife and the supposed watchdogs of a free press have relinquished impartiality and come out as partisan.Instead of championing freedom of expression, they turn a blind eye to abuses against those who dare to express views divergent to the neo-liberal narrative.This is not just happening here at home.Reactionary forces are raging with equal menace in the Middle East, where a gang of powerful emirs are bullying a tiny polity and threatens to shut down a progressive and alternative television station while the world watches indifferently.In our country, reactionary forces represent a movement masquerading as guardians against so-called state capture. The notion of state capture, which presumably is a pseudonym for corruption, is an anti-dialectical notion peddled by opportunistic phrase-mongers and lazy analysts.A captured state is a weak state and a weak state signifies hollowed out institutions, including the judiciary and the media.These institutions are often praised respectively for being independent and robust, in the case of the judiciary, in holding in check executive power, while the media hold to the fire the feet of politicians supposedly prone to abuse of power. The notion of state capture, at least dialectically, is therefore nonsense.The reality of corrupting the state is an empirical danger, but media revelations of so called state capture, with less than the whole truth, imperils the battle against corruption of the state, which is not only the concern of a self-serving bourgeois class, but for all.In the instance of the Middle East, the glaring abuse of immense political and economic power escaped serious global scrutiny when last month Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt unleashed diplomatic and economic sanctions against Qatar. This was accompanied by threats to shut down the free Arab voice represented by the al-Jazeera TV network, which continues to break down barriers to free speech, encourages alternative voices and raises the consciousness of the population in the region.In the instance of our country, attempts were made earlier this year by reactionary elements in cahoots with white right-wing liberals and black pseudo-leftists to shut down the ANN7 TV station which provides an alternative political consciousness to that of the capitalist hegemony of a self-serving corporate media, its collaborators and pseudo political analysts, who are well paid for their mediocre opinions.While not as influential as al-Jazeera, ANN7 also raises consciousness and exposes the reality of the forces at play in a South Africa where political amnesia is so potent and where some black media practitioners are betting on the privileged and the status quo for their livelihood.Threats to physically harm journalists working for ANN7 and The New Age newspaper and attempts to shut down the TV station also escape serious scrutiny from the erstwhile guardians of the free press and the partisan editors watchdog body.This is indicative of the degeneration of the South African National Editors Forum (Sanef), which turns a blind eye to abuse against media outlets, journalists and reporters who are positioned outside of the dominant opinion and agenda of a self-serving corporate media and their embedded collaborators.Consistency is a principle which fosters credibility so the point is when you jump to the defence of those with opposite opinions and beliefs, you defend a principle which enhances your credibility.Sanef recently jumped to the defence of a harmless male editor of a dwindling business paper, which was the right thing to do, but the watchdog body is inconsistent and its actions lack credibility.The detractors of this editor at large are on the thin edge of the wedge in overestimating his influence, but their efforts paid off in going viral. The follow-up actions of Sanef will be closely watched as it continues to defend the interests and ideology of privilege.Also to be watched closely is the danger brewing in the Middle East, because the actions of the reactionary bullies against Qatar with the spectre of war and more strife in the region looming and the threats to silence al-Jazeera mounting, reactionary forces are attempting to turn back the tide of progress.The attempt is to burn bridges towards a truly liberated Arab world of peace, harmony and equality for workers, students, children, women and the population of the region.Reactionary elements here meanwhile are raging against attempts to break the structural stranglehold on an economy which continues to support inequality, unemployment and poverty.Reactionaries and their collaborators, among them once conscientious journalists, freedom fighters and intellectuals, remain blind to the reality that is this: the absence of economic democracy, which continues to elude the black majority, can only result in the decline of political democracy and the combustion of the tinder of an uprising by the poor.Musa Kunta MohamedMusa Kunta Mohamed is a writer and social commentator
