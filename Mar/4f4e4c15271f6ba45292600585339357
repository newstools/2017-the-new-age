In the year of celebrating the centenary of the late OR Tambo, this month will see South Africa and Gauteng commemorating the 57th anniversary of Human Rights Day.The day is observed in commemoration of the 1960 Sharpeville massacre where 69 people were killed for standing up in protest against the oppressive pass law, on March 21.The law required blacks to carry the hated dompas (pass books) or suffer being harassed and arrested by the police. The tragedy became a pivotal event in the history of the struggle for liberation, exposing the inhumane brutality of the regime.This year s festivities include a build-up programme under the theme Celebrating our Constitutional Democracy.The Gauteng sport, arts, culture and recreation spokesperson, Nomazwe Ntlokwana, said as much as the day was about commemorating the loss of life, it was also about celebrating what came out of the struggle against apartheid. SA s constitutional democracy is the bedrock in which the protection of everyone s human rights is founded. Since the dawn of democracy, every South African and persons living in the country, are guaranteed their human rights and freedom irrespective of their legal/illegal status, origin, race, gender or sexual orientation, Ntlokwana said.This year also marks 21 years since the signing of the Constitution into law by former head of state Nelson Mandela, in Sharpeville. She said the choice of Sharpeville in Vereeniging symbolised the coming around of a new era following the 1902 Treaty of Vereeniging signed between the British and Afrikaners that disenfranchised the black majority and set in motion processes that laid the foundation for apartheid . With the centenary of the late OR Tambo upon us, the Gauteng city region will be working with the OR and Adelaide Tambo Foundation to honour and celebrate his contributions and legacy to South Africa s constitutional democracy, Ntlokwana said. He is considered by many as the champion of democracy on whose convictions our Constitution is ingrained. He embraced the values of unity, service, sacrifice, collective leadership, honesty, discipline, debates and mutual respect, among others. Meanwhile, Constitutional Hill in Johannesburg, which includes the Old Fort, the Women s Jail, Number four and five prisons and the Constitutional Court, has been declared a National Heritage Site. Among those imprisoned there were Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, Mary Fitzgerald and Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.NTOMBI NKOSIntombin@thenewage.co.za
