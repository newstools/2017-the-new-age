Former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo says Africans need to come up with solutions within the continent.Obasanjo said Africans had no luxury to wait for outsiders to solve their problems. We must know where we come from. We are grappling with threats to peace and security. The DRC hasn&#8217;t enjoyed desirable peace, he said.Obasanjo was speaking at African Leadership Forum (ALF) in Johannesburg on Thursday.The former president told delegates that conflicts were caused by poor leadership and inequity, adding that the continent is now having food insecurity. No hungry man is at peace, today you have food insecurity.&#8221;Meanwhile, Namibian Deputy Prime Minister Netumbo Nandi says the source of conflicts must be the continent s focus and the continent needs ownership to be part of the process that comes up with solutions. We must accept that there s poverty, we have harambee policy, and exclusivity spells conflict. Leadership must be collective aspirations and must transform our relationship with the outside world,&#8221; Nandi said.-Sipho Jack&nbsp;
