With Gustavo Paez having finally broken his duck at Kaizer Chiefs, coach Steve Komphela says it’s a relief for everyone who may have had doubted the striker. Paez scored his first goal for Amakhosi against Stellenbosch FC on Saturday in their 3-0 victory in the Nedbank Cup last 32. Komphela believes this is the beginning of many more to come from the Venezuelan striker who joined the club in January’s transfer window period. “Whether we like it or not we are all human beings, we sense things. He can hear what others say, he can feel it,” Komphela said. “In a match, you can see how desperate he gets. I’m sure now his goal will give him the confidence to go forward, He must be now saying ‘I’ve registered my first goal, there has to be more that I can score’. “But we also have to help his cause by playing to his strength, as with the goal scored, we played to it. “There were a couple of times in the first half against Stellenbosch FC when Siphiwe Tshabalala was looking for him, but couldn’t find him exactly. “But you could see he’s a good runner and I’m sure we will pick it from there and utilise that.” Komphela admitted that there were doubts from supporters and administrators about whether they had signed a good player or not, as Paez had not scored since his debut in February. “It should be a relief to everybody because as coaches and administration we say ‘but wait a minute, who did we buy, is this a real striker?” “Even if the guy has other qualities, we see him as a striker and if he doesn’t score some people start doubting the selection. “So that was an indication that he can score well. “If you look at the goal he scored it’s  a classic , the movement, the touch, the finishing. “You can’t ask for more class than that.” Komphela will be counting on Paez to come up with the goods again when Chiefs meet Baroka FC tomorrow in the Absa Premiership match at Peter Mokaba stadium at 8.15pm. -NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
