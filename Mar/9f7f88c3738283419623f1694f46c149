President Jacob Zuma on Friday said a single law should be developed to address the issue of land restitution without compensation.Zuma made the remarks during the official opening of the National House of Traditional Leaders (NHTL) in Parliament.&#8220;&#8230;We must undertake a pre-colonial audit of land ownership, use and occupation patterns. Once the audit has been completed, a single law should be developed to address the issue of land restitution without compensation,&#8221; Zuma said.Zuma said the laws governing land have aided in causing delays to equitable redistribution.&#8220;&#8230; there are too many laws dealing with land reform which causes confusion and delays.The fact remains that land hunger is real. This is not surprising as this was the fundamental question at the centre of the liberation struggle,&#8221; said Zuma.According to Zuma government is currently looking at two programmes in order to accelerate redistribution of land.&#8220;We are also looking at the possible re-design and establishment of the National Land Claims Commission as a Chapter 9 Institution, so that it can have the necessary powers to help us reverse this historical injustice,&#8221; said Zuma.The President added that the proposals would likely require a Constitutional amendment in order to come into effect.His comments come after the ANC caucus in Parliament on Tuesday voted against a motion brought by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) to establish an AD HOC Committee to amend section 25 of the constitution which empowers land expropriation.Following defeat of its motion, the EFF accused the ANC of refusing&#8221; to implement an aspect that is essential to radical economic transformation&#8221; as well as saying the governing party was &#8221; hypocrytical&#8221;However Zuma on Friday urged for unity among Africans in order to effectively turn the tide of land redistribution.&#8220;This is a matter the majority, blacks in general and Africans in particular, should not quarrel about or disagree about. If we do so we will not be putting together our strength and would return back to the time when the land was taken away,&#8221;said Zuma.&#8220;We need to be united on this matter,&#8221; added Zuma.Meanwhile Zuma urged traditional leaders to take an active role in advancing radical socio-economic transformation adding that government had produced enough policy documents and Bills and now was the time for action.&#8220;We urge our Traditional leaders to use this opportunity to bring about economic stability and cultural development in rural areas.&#8220;There are many opportunities. Heritage sites ought to be developed in an effort to contribute to local economies, through the promotion of cultural tourism,&#8221; said Zuma.-TNA Reporter
