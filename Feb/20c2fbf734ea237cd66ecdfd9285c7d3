Angry Randfontein community members are on Monday protesting outside the venue of Gauteng State of the Province Address (SOPA) regarding the tragic death of Life Esidimeni.During the Sopa address by Premier of Gauteng David Makhura, residents are protesting against Makhura with placards written, &#8220;Remember the Esidimeni 100+&#8221; and &#8220;Makhura Must Fall&#8221;.The protest follows the health Ombusman report that was released early this month which revealed that more deaths linked to the Esidimeni s disaster was above 100 and increasing.The Ombudsman chairman Malegapuru Makgoba told the media that Gauteng data had many problems as some of the people who died had two dates of death. We are still getting the data of deaths and they are already over 100 deaths. We discovered that all the 27 Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) where the patients were taken operated under invalid licences, Mokgoba said.Residents who attended today s protest said Makhura had to take responsibility for the loss of lifes that happened at the NGO S. They further said the decision of former MEC Qedani Mahlangu s resignation was not enough for the pain she caused to the families.Gauteng African National Congress Youth League also called for the premier to step down and the entire Provincial Executive as they didn t have the much needed leadership the province needed. However, the Youth League later retracted the statement.Meanwhile, during his address Makhura told guests that he will make sure that there was a restorative justice and also inspire confidence in the health system again.-TNA Reporter
