Brazil scored after 12 seconds against Australia before completing a 4-0 rout in a friendly on Tuesday to hand the hosts a wake-up call before they leave for the Confederations Cup where they face Germany in their opener.The Socceroos got off to a terrible start when centre back Bailey Wright gave away possession with the second pass of the game, allowing Diego Souza to hammer home a low shot to groans from most of the 49,000 fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.Souza wrapped up the win for a second-string Brazil side with a header in added time after Thiago Silva headed the second from a goalmouth scramble in the 62nd minute and substitute Taison finished off a brilliant team goal in the 75th.Australia, who play world champions Germany in Group B at the Confedations Cup in Russia on Monday, entered the stadium with cautious optimism after last week&#8217;s win over Saudi Arabia reignited hopes of a fourth straight World Cup appearance.But the crushing early blow of Souza&#8217;s early goal in Tuesday&#8217;s game left Ange Postecoglou&#8217;s side rattled and they were only spared further punishment in the first half by Brazil&#8217;s failure to convert several early chances.Australia were humbled 6-0 away by five-times world champions Brazil when the teams last met in 2013, which was a prelude to former coach Holger Osieck&#8217;s dismissal and replacement by Postecoglou.Postecoglou will wake up to some stinging headlines but he was philosophical in defeat, and said responsibility for the second half blow-out lay with him making a raft of changes.HEAVY DEFEAT&#8220;You never like getting defeated and you don&#8217;t like a heavy defeat particularly at home,&#8221; he told reporters.&#8220;From our perspective it&#8217;s about preparing for that game in about a week&#8217;s time.&#8220;We did need to get some game-time in the players, that was important tonight.&#8221;The Brazilians, who lost to arch-rivals Argentina 1-0 in a friendly last week &#8211; coach Tite&#8217;s first defeat after nine wins in charge &#8211; were without Neymar and a host of other top players.But they were in a determined mood against Australia who must go back to the drawing board before leaving for Russia.&#8220;We kept a good defence .. I was happy because the players were supporting each other,&#8221; Tite said.The Socceroos will also face African champions Cameroon and South American title holders Chile in their section at the Confederations Cup, which is a warm-up event for the World Cup in Russia next year involving the continental champions.-Reuters
