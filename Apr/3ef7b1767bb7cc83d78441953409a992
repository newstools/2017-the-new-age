Most of the victims were pupils travelling from their homes in Verena, Mpumalanga to Refano Primary School and Mahlenga Secondary School.The department of education yesterday said that 19 of 20 victims of the crash could not be identified as their facial features had been burnt and DNA tests had to be conducted.Max Mayisela, the father of three other pupils killed in the crash, said his heart was broken. His children Thapelo, 14, Sibusiso, 10, and Nokhuthula, eight, were killed but daughter Phumzile Mathibela, 15, survived and remains in hospital.Their aunt, Khabo Madihlaba, said: We went to the scene with my sister and she remained in the car. After I saw what had happened I lied to my sister that the paramedics were busy with the children. By then I had no hope. KUTULLO MADISHA
