Now that a breakthrough win is under their belt, Orlando Pirates have their long-missing confidence back ahead of their Absa Premiership match against Maritzburg United at Orlando stadium tonight.This summation was made by coach Kjell Jonevret following the Buccaneers eye-catching victory against Free State Stars in the Nedbank Cup last 16 on Saturday to advance to the quarterfinals. Pirates also got their revenge after losing to Stars in the league two weeks ago. Jonevret, highly pleased with his players performance in the game on Sunday, wants to see the same drive tonight and said he expects to make some changes as he needs fresh legs. It is going to be tough for us, we only have two days to rest and are now playing this important game against Maritzburg, Jonevrete said. But it is also good for us to play at home again, we haven t played there for over a month now. I think the last time we played at home was on March 7. That s a long time. They are a talented group of players, but they need some confidence and maybe a victory like this will help them . We have to change around a little bit against Maritzburg, we need fresh players. We can t go out there with tired legs, Jonevrete said. One of the changes the Swede is likely to make is in the goalkeeping department. Goalkeeper Siyabonga Mpontshane manned the goals in the cup match against Ea Lla Koto on Saturday, replacing Brighton Mhlongo, but is likely to be on the bench tonight. We have four keepers at Pirates right now and all of them are good. Mpontshane played in the last cup game, so we have to rotate them around a little bit, Jonevret said. I trust our goalkeeper coach Rowen Fernandez, he works with them every day and I listen to him, Mpontshane was really good in the last match. -Neville Khoza|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
