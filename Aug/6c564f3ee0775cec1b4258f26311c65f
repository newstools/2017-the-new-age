Though South African literacy levels have improved from 92.9% in 2013 to 96% in 2016, more still needs to be done to encourage South Africans to read more books.These are the sentiments of South African Book Development Council leaders who gathered at the launch of this year s National Book Week and South African Book Fair held at the Market Theatre workshop in Newtown yesterday.The launch was attended by among others, the council s CEO Elitha Van der Sandt, director of Gauteng Library services, Koekie Meyer, author and poet Koleka Putuma and this year s Book Week ambassadors, Setumo Motsoaledi, and Mogau Paulina Motlatswi.Van der Sandt said the Buy A Book campaign, which offers individuals the opportunity to help develop South Africa through buying and donating a book was one of the successes the industry should be proud of. The fact that nine of our provinces have called for National Book Week across all provinces is a course for celebration. Another one is the take up of the Buy a Book campaign, now on its third year. Book reading has increased and we will continue doing reading surveys to track reading figures. Meyer also announced that the city of Johannesburg would be rolling out eight new libraries furnished with 8000 to 15000 books in order to make literacy a reality and as a means for job creation. One of the biggest problems is unemployment. We recently had to call off the launch of a library after we did not involve the community in the roll out.But since then we have opened two more libraries with the help of the community. As a build up to the National Book Week, we are opening eight more 800m libraries in Gauteng with 8000 to 15000 books to areas under provided in Gauteng. One of these will be an Archives library which will be situated in Kagiso on the West Rand, Meyer said.Van der Sandt also awarded Nelson Mandela Metropolitan municipality librarian, Joe Lamani with the inaugural national book week most innovative award. We always say librarians do not read, but Bra Joe has proven that librarians do care.We are enthused by Bra Joe who led a positive march to encourage literacy at a time when we march for the negative staff and that is why we have come up with this award, Van der Sandt said.siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
