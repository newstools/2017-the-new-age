Three of the country s music veterans, gospel great Rebecca Malope, jazz pianist Don Laka and the accomplished musician, Babsy Mlangeni, are this year s recipients of the South African music Awards (Samas) lifetime achievement awards. These local legends will receive their special awards at a ceremony at Sun City on May 26.The announcement was made by the Recording Industry of South Africa (Risa) who are the organisers, just two weeks before the 23rd instalment of the awards.The legendary Mlangeni, who is one of the leaders of South African soul music in the 1960-80s, said the honour served to show that his disability was no hindrance to his talent and success. I have proven that disabled people are also capable people, Mlangeni said. This award honours the contribution I have made since 1963 when I began my music career. I have used my disability to inspire other disabled musicians, among them Steve Kekana. What excites me is the fact that I am being honoured while I am still alive. Many musicians do not get such a chance, so this is a great feeling for me. Risa CEO Nhlanhla Sibisi said he and his team were proud to announce that Rebecca Malope, the Queen of Gospel, the pioneer of kwaai-jazz, Don Laka and 1970s and 1980s music pioneer Mlangeni would be honoured with Lifetime Achievement Awards. Sibisi said: We as the Sama organisers value these honours highly. We believe that our veterans who served the industry with unmatched dedication and gave us timeless music should never be forgotten by history. As such, we look forward to etching the names of Rebecca Malope, Don Laka and Babsy Mlangeni in our prestigious list of lifetime achievers. We say well done on such colourful careers and let this be a token of our appreciation of your talent as a nation. siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
