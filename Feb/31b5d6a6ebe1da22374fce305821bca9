Civil society groups have called for the implementation of effective and urgent measures to protect young girls from harmful cultural practices including female genital mutilation (FGM).Although South Africa is not listed among the nations that practice FGM, experts say it is performed by some migrants from South Sudan and other African countries living in the country.Barbara Kitui s research shows FGM was embedded within the Venda community where women undergo a traditional ceremony known as muthuso which involves cutting of the vaginal flesh of the mother by a traditional healer .The World Health Organisation describes it as a procedure that intentionally alters the female genital organs for non-medical reasons .It is estimated that nearly 100 million young girls in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia have undergone FGM.As the world marked International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM, more calls for education have been made. The importance of education to address negative social norms has been demonstrated in Egypt, where the reduction in the risk of girls undergoing FGM has been linked both to the educational attainment of their mothers and other women in their communities, UN Women said.The women s agency said women were still risk of FGM even in countries where this phenomenon was not prevalent.Civil society group Girls Not Brides lists gender inequality and patriarchy as some of the biggest contributing factors behind the harmful practice. It is driven by social expectations of what it means to be a girl. There are patriarchal means of controlling girls sexuality, often linked to culture and religion, Girls Not Brides said.UN Women says further research on the issue was still required in Asia and Latin America.Zodidi Mhlanazodidim@thenewage.co.za
