The Democratic Alliance has signed up with Patriotic Alliance(PA) as a coalition partner in the Nelson Mandela Bay.A letter by mayor Athol Trollip has revealed his plans to appoint PA councillor Marlon Daniels to his mayoral committee.The letter which was directed to the DA leader Mmusi Maimane and leader of the federal executive James Selfe last week, Trollip described the relationship with deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani as volatile and has become increasingly unsustainable.In the letter Trollip expressed how PA was as determined as the DA and its other coalition partners, COPE and ACDP, not to allow the city to fall back into the hands of the ANC.&#8220;The instability has been witnessed by the Patriotic Alliance who incidentally share support in one of our stronghold constituencies who voted overwhelmingly and record numbers for political changes,&#8221;Trollip said.&#8220;The PA is determined as we are and our other co-governance partners are in the NMBM not to allow this city to by default back to the hands of ANC,They also said that they will not sit and watch the other opposition mobilising and uniting around race in order to make decisions on the fate of the citizens, especially poor citizens regarding service delivery and good governance issues,&#8221; he said.Unconfirmed reports suggest that the PA has yet &#8220;to sign anything&#8221; but they are willing to work with the DA in the meantime.In his letter, Trollip said: &#8220;If we committ to providing the citizens of the city and the country a united and viable alternative to the ANC in 2019, we will have to take partners like PA on board.&#8221;The coalition agreement between Trollip s DA and Bobani s UDM has been strained, with Bobani being accused by the DA as not following the rules &#8220;in terms of hiring&#8221;.This, according to the DA, related to &#8220;the different interpretation of the law in relation to the appointment of the city manager&#8221;. He believed the appointment was unlawful.&#8220;In light of this I would appreciate it if you would inform our other co-signatories to the NMBM co-governance agreement that the PA has joined our coalition and that I intend to appoint councillor Daniels to my mayoral committee,&#8221;Trollip said.Meanwhile UDM leader Bantu Holomisa last week insisted that the coalition government in Nelson Mandela Bay is not under threat and would remain intact until the end of the term in 2019.Speaking at the Veeplaas Community Hall last week, Holomisa said :&#8221;The UDM is still firmly part of this coalition government despite the challenges of the past few months.&#8221;&nbsp;
