Fees Must Fall campaign activist Mcebo Dlamini is expected to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate&#8217;s court on Thursday. The former Wits University student leader is facing charges of theft assault public violence and malicious damage to property. His case was postponed after a brief appearance at the Johannesburg Magistrate s Court last month after his lawyer failed to avail himself. Dlamini told the court that his lawyer had to seek medical attention.He was arrested in October last year at the University&#8217;s residence following the Fees Must Fall student protests for free education. The protests brought Universities to a stand standstill, followed by violent clashes with the police as students vowed to fight for free education. The protests came to end in 2016 when it was announced that there would be no fees increase for the 2016 academic year. Dlamini was later granted R2,000 bail and released in November 2016. The activist has constantly pronounced that the case against him was politically motivated.
