The SA Football Players Union has turned to South African Football Association (Safa) president Danny Jordaan for intervention as cases involving its players drag on.Union president Tebogo Monyai said it hoped Jordan s intervention would help speed up the process of having the cases heard. Monyai was responding to questions regarding the latest on the Dominic Isaacs and Royal Eagles case. The former Kaizer Chiefs and Ajax Cape Town defender took the National First Division to the PSL s dispute resolution chamber after his contract was terminated. Eagles offered a month s salary and the DRC ruling ordered Eagles to pay Isaacs all outstanding monies.Eagles offered to appeal the ruling but Monyai said the matter is yet to be finalised. The ruling was delivered in December last year and since then the player has not been getting a salary because he is unattached. We feel Eagles are applying delaying tactics just to frustrate the player. The reason why we approached the Safa president is because the case is with Safa arbitration. We hope after finding out what s taking so long, the matter will be concluded and let the player continue with his life. The union president said another unresolved matter is that of winger Philani Shange and Chippa United. The Port Elizabeth side released Shange despite the former Golden Arrows and AmaZulu winger still being under contract with them. Chippa promised to pay Shange in November last year but they failed to honour their agreement.-LINDA XIMBA|news@thenewage.co.za
