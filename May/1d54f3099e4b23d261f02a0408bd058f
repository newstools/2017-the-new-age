Lack of knowledge about health issues for mothers especially in remote rural areas is among factors contributing to serious infant skin conditions.Paediatric dermatologist and head of dermatology at Red Cross Children s Hospital, Dr Carol Hlela, said this at the launch of Johnson &amp; Johnson s Baby Healthy Skin project in Johannesburg yesterday.The partnership with Unjani Clinics aims to improve the health of more than 3 million babies by 2020. Through lack of knowledge, mothers, parents and guardians in general make wrong choices on how to look after baby skin and clearly it s not wrong choices by intention, it s choices based on what they know, cultural beliefs and myths that have been passed down from generation to generation, that damage skin, predisposing children to infection and unfortunately, those children succumb to infections, she said.Hlela said in her line of work she had to deal with some of the worst cases. Ordinarily, just dry and dry itchy skin is common and a lot of people are seeing that, but by the time those cases come to us by virtue of us being a referral hospital, we see dry skin being infected sometimes impetigo bacterial infection and other forms of infections such as staphylococcus scalded skin syndrome, she said.Hlela said the lack of access to clean water sees mothers use harsh products to try to clean the water. If clean water is all you can get, rather wash the baby with that, she said.Jacquelyn Paterson, Johnson &amp; Johnson s Baby portfolio manager in South Africa and sub-Sahara said: We have 100% identified that in SA, mums need more information about how to take care of their baby s skin. Not enough mums understand that baby skin continues to develop past the first year of life and that the product choices that they make have a critical impact on the overall development of a healthy child.
