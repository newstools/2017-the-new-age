The Competition Commission has conducted a search and seizure operation at the premises of nine fresh produce market agents on ThursdayCompetition Commission spokesperson Thembinkosi Bonakele said the reason was that the commission was investigating collusion resulting in high prices to the most vulnerable homes. The Commission is concerned with the prevalence of collusion in the food sector, as higher prices of these commodities affect the most vulnerable households. The poor spend a disproportionately high percentage of their income on food, Bonakele said. Also, cartel activities in this sector serve to keep out emerging black farmers and agents out of the market. It is for these reasons that this sector ranks high in our priority list, and cartels, big or small, will be rooted out. The search and seizure operation is part of an investigation into cartel conduct which was reported by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.The premises are located in the Tshwane Market in Pretoria and the Joburg Market in Johannesburg, Gauteng, the country s economic hub.The suspects are: Botha Roodt Group (Botha Roodt); Subtropico (Pty) Ltd (Subtropico); RSA Group (Pty) Ltd (RSA Group); Dapper Market Agents (Pty) Ltd (Dapper); DW Fresh Produce CC (DW Fresh); Farmers Trust CC (Farmers Trust); Noordvaal Market Agents (Pty) Ltd (Noordvaal); Marco Fresh Produce Market Agency (Marco); and Wenpro Market Agents CC (Wenpro).ANN7 Business editor Clive Ramathibela-Smith says commission is targeting cartels to the benefit of consumers.In their statement the commission said during the search the is would will seize information, documents, data and records that have a bearing on the investigation.The commission reported that the operation was conducted with due regard to the rights of all the affected persons and was done with search and seizure warrants from the High Court Gauteng Division, Pretoria, in terms of section 46 of the Competition Act.The City of Joburg recently announced that an official had been arrested and appeared in court after the City s General Shadrack Sibiya submitted a report detailing for theft, fraud and corruption amounting to R7.5million at the Joburg market.TNA Reporter
