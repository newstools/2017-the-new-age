Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said on Saturday he would not impose his successor and that if the ruling ZANU-PF party felt he should retire, it would hold an extraordinary congress to choose a new leader.The world&#8217;s oldest leader, who turned 93 this week, has maintained a tight grip on power in Zimbabwe since independence from Britain in 1980. He is due to stand for re-election next year and says ZANU-PF has no viable alternative candidates.Mugabe was joined by thousands of supporters to celebrate his birthday at a school in Matobo just outside the second biggest city Bulawayo, and a short distance from the grave of colonialist Cecil John Rhodes.Rhodes was an imperialist, businessman and politician who played a dominant role in Southern Africa in the late 19th century, driving the annexation of vast swathes of land.&#8220;Others are saying &#8216;President, choose a successor before you retire&#8217;. Is that not imposition? Me imposing someone on the party? No, I don&#8217;t want that,&#8221; Mugabe said.&#8220;This is an issue for the congress to choose. We can have an extraordinary congress if the president retires but you said I should be your candidate in the next election.&#8221;Matobo is one of the areas that suffered heavy casualties during the 1980s crackdown by an elite North Korean-trained brigade against rebels loyal to Joshua Nkomo, Mugabe&#8217;s then rival. Rights groups say 20,000 civilians died during the so-called Gukurahundi offensive.Critics say Mugabe&#8217;s policies, like the seizure of white-owned farms for blacks and his black economic empowerment drive have ruined the once promising country.Mugabe, a pariah in the West, said he agreed with U.S. President Donald Trump&#8217;s &#8220;America for Americans&#8221; approach and criticised Zimbabweans seeking jobs in America.Mugabe attributed his long life to what he said was God&#8217;s mission to &#8220;fulfil the needs and demands&#8221; of Zimbabweans.&#8220;I thank the Lord and say I accept the mission my Lord,&#8221; said Mugabe, who wore a black cowboy hat with national colours and a print shirt designed by his wife Grace.Mugabe said he only had one sister left and missed his siblings, adding that &#8220;when I look back I say aah, oh Lord, why were these taken before me and why have I remained so long, alone and alive. I cannot answer that.&#8221;A local bakery donated a 96 kg cake designed in the shape of the Zimbabwean map, while party officials jostled to give Mugabe gifts ranging from sculptures to cattle.-Reuters
