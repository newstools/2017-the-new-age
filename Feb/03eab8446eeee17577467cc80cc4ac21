West Ham United manager Slaven Bilic was sent to the stands after his frustration boiled over when West Bromwich Albion salvaged a last-gasp 2-2 draw in the Premier League on Saturday.Bilic lost his cool when Gareth McAuley&#8217;s header deep into stoppage time denied his side after they had fought back from conceding after six minutes at the London Stadium.The Croatian was angry at Nacer Chadli&#8217;s opener, feeling there had been a foul in the build-up, and was also perplexed when West Ham had a 16th-minute equaliser ruled out by referee Michael Oliver.&#8220;The way we played makes me proud and happy. We should have scored more but we scored enough to win the game,&#8221; Bilic, whose side forged ahead after the break through Sofiane Feghouli&#8217;s 63rd-minute tap-in and Manuel Lanzini&#8217;s 87th-minute shot, said.&#8220;To concede like this, it is very frustrating. The decisions were big time against us, every one of them.&#8220;It is hard for referees but when you are on the wrong side of all decisions it makes you very angry.&#8220;The referee was very bad today.&#8221;Bilic took his anger out on a pitch-side microphone and could face disciplinary action.&#8220;To be fair I am already big time punished with what happened in the game,&#8221; he said.&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that I crossed the line, it was nothing personal. It was the fourth or fifth decision which went against us and it&#8217;s hard to get over that without reacting.&#8221;West Ham are 10th with 32 points while West Brom are eighth on 37.-Reuters
