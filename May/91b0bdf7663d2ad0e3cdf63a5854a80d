The ANC Gauteng PEC has on Sunday condemned premature campaigning for ANC president. This follows their PEC meeting held yesterday in Johannesburg.In a statement they said the PEC observed that despite the decision of the NEC that the discussion on the leadership for the 54th National Conference, there were leaders who were criss-crossing the country campaigning to be elected at the National Conference.In addition there were many premature leadership pronouncements. Last week the Northern Cape PEC endorsed Cyril Ramaphosa, Sanco national has also added their support to the ANC deputy president in the past week.Hope Mankwana Papo, provincial secretary said this could be detrimental.&#8220;This is an unhealthy political situation that serves to further erode the authority of constitutional structures as decisions are either ignored or treated with contempt. Those who are disciplined have been waiting for the opportunity for the leadership discussion to be opened formally by the NEC,&#8221; Papo said.&#8220;It is against this backdrop that the PEC has resolved to start engaging regional and branch structures on the leadership question in the context of the need to renew and rebuild the ANC into a movement that wins back public confidence and plays a role of being a true leader of society,&#8221; Papo said.The party reported that the PEC is of the view that the manner in which this un-official campaign is currently unfolding is divisive and factional and creates more problems for the movement rather than help to unite it.&#8220;We need an open atmosphere, which enables ANC members and supporters to confront the challenges of the organisation by electing a credible leadership collective that is capable of rising to the occasion in response to the challenges facing our country at this moment,&#8221; Papo said.Amongst other issues the PEC discussed is their concern is the alarming rate of violence and killings against women.&#8220;We call on the SAPS in Gauteng to step up measures in the fight against gender-based violence and ensure the safety of women and children, working in partnership with communities,&#8221; he said.&#8220;We pledged our unqualified support to the &#8216;Men s March&#8217; against gender-based violence that took place in Tshwane and other similar campaigns around the province. Let there be more men and the rest of society who speak out against this menace,&#8221; he saidThe organisation also expressed their disquiet about community protests saying there can be no justification for violence and vigilantism in a democracy.&#8220;The right of communities to peaceful protest and to have their voice heard is something that is guaranteed by the Constitution of the Republic, destroying private property and public infrastructure is self-defeating and will only result in a vicious cycle of underdevelopment in the affected areas as more resources will have to be channeled to fixing damaged infrastructure before the development shortfalls are addressed,&#8221; the statement read.TNA Reporter
