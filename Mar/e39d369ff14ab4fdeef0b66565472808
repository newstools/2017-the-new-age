I will be more focused on how a Miss South Africa communicates current issues and debates. I ll be looking for confidence, authenticity, the ability to articulate one s thoughts and ideas, someone who is comfortable in their skin and a natural doer, as opposed to someone who sits and waits, hoping for things to happen for them, he said.Bringing her expertise as judge, TV presenter and Idol SA judge Unathi Msengana said she was looking for someone who South Africans can relate to .Set to broadcast live at 5pm on Mzansi Magic (DStv 161) and M-Net (101), entertainment will be provided by a roster of top notch performers including Lira, DJ Kent, Dominic Neil and Idols season 12 finalist Thami Shobede.news@thenewage.co.za
