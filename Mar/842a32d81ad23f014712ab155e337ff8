The US Senate on Tuesday voted overwhelmingly to approve Montenegro as NATO&#8217;s 29th member, a move backed by President Donald Trump while seen as a rebuke to Russia&#8217;s intervention in Eastern Europe.After a procedural vote earlier in the week, the accession treaty for the small Balkan nation to join the transatlantic alliance sailed through on a 97-2 vote.The measure now goes to the White House for Trump&#8217;s formal ratification.To date, 25 other NATO members have ratified Montenegro&#8217;s accession, a country of 620,000 people seen as a geostrategic ally. The Netherlands and Spain have yet to do so.&#8220;I&#8217;m convinced that our alliance will be stronger if Montenegro joins,&#8221; Senate Democrat Chris Murphy said on the Senate floor before the vote, noting that the country, once a part of Yugoslavia, &#8220;occupies an incredibly important space on the world map.&#8221;The North Atlantic Treaty Organization holds its summit on May 25 in Brussels, where Trump will use the opportunity to reaffirm Washington&#8217;s strong commitment to the alliance, according to the White House.The Kremlin is opposed to Montenegro&#8217;s accession, calling it a &#8220;provocation&#8221; that would reinforce the pro-Western military alliance&#8217;s presence in the Balkans.The US vote comes days after a Montenegrin special prosecutor accused &#8220;Russian state bodies&#8221; of involvement in an alleged coup plot during Montenegro&#8217;s October election.Moscow branded the accusation as &#8220;absurd.&#8221;Russia also stands accused of interfering in the US presidential election last year, when US intelligence agencies say it leaked hacked emails that damaged Democrat Hillary Clinton&#8217;s campaign.Several senators have framed Montenegro&#8217;s accession as nothing less than a test of resolve against Russian President Vladimir Putin.Republican Senator Susan Collins said she was &#8220;very happy that the Russian campaign to try to dissuade the people of Montenegro from joining NATO, and the disinformation that Russia disseminated, was not successful.&#8221;Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Montenegro&#8217;s membership sends &#8220;a strong message of resolve to Russia as it invades its neighbors and seeks to upend the international order.&#8221;Republicans Rand Paul and Mike Lee voted against the measure.-AFP
