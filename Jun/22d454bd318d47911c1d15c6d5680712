Walter Sisulu residents in the Eastern Cape are still without houses, this was after they had been moved from their settlement to make way for the housing project which would provide them with houses.Two years later, only about 30 houses have been built which are still incomplete. In 2015 Walter Sisulu informal settlement residents in Mdantsane were moved to make way for the Mdantsane Cluster Two housing project.A community member said: Every night the nyaope boys hide behind these houses and people are robbed. At least 154 houses were going to be built in Walter Sisulu, 34 in Francis Mel, 105 in Hani Park, 300 in Winnie Mandela, 91 in Mahlangu, 25 in Gwentshe, 75 in Mathemba Vuso and 88 in Daluxolo informal settlement.A community member Nosiviwe Booi said that the construction company that was supposed to have build them houses, left the site with no explanation, leaving the residents with many unanswered question. Most of the houses are still at foundation level, but about thirty houses already have windows and doors, Booi said.In September 2015, the residents protested about the quality of the materials used for the houses.The protest was later joined by workers complaining about wages.-TNA Reporter
