The Red carpet for this year s South African Music Awards (Samas) was a rather dull affair except for a few good looks from some of the country s top celebrities and socialites, who came out to play on Saturday.Among those who put their best foot forward was Pearl Thusi in a sheer gold see-through gown designed by Lesego Kgosimolao, while style Queen, Bonang Matheba was an instant stunner on the red carpet in a red mannequin Orapeleng Modutle Style Avenue design.While some have taken to social media to lambast and question the Quantico and Lip Sync Battle Africa s sense of fashion, many agreed that Thusi brought class to the sleaze and classless society of see-through dresses that have been the stuff of awards ceremonies in the past five years.Thusi, who gave us some serious Beyonc and Blue Ivy vibes as she walked the red carpet with her daughter in almost matching sequin embellished gowns, posted a picture of the dress on Twitter with the caption: So @AustinMalema and I decided to do things properly this time , she said in reference to the celebrity photographer following their fallout last year, when the actress shared on social media a picture Malema shot backstage at the Samas without crediting him, resulting in the hashgtag #CreditThePhotographer taking Twitter by storm. Moving right along.The less said about the attentionseeking Skolopad, the better. The Free State-born wannabe musician went further than the revealing yellow dress she wore at the Metro FM Music Awards in February.She made sure she made a grand red carpet entrance as the doors were about to be closed, with a cheap dress that showed off her one thigh and bum cheek.She had to crawl and lie on the floor, just so she could grab her fair share of the headlines, what a cheek.Back to the usual red carpet stunners, Nandi Madida was as simple and elegant as they come in a black Scalo dress by renowned fashion designer, Sello Medupe.The biggest music award ceremony of the country was hosted by choreographer Somizi Mhlongo and comedian Tumi Morake.The pair served pure fire on the stage and their chemistry was just as ignited.Somizi, who made an incredible sixoutfit change made sure that he gave the audience and viewers at home a clear view of his red soles.Isibaya actress Nomzamo Mbatha showed off her banging body in a Vanessa Gounden creamy white dress with gold trimmings here and there.Mbatha, who usually has her flawless cleavage on display in the majority of her outfits, opted for a fully covering ensemble this time around, but it was nicely done as her body silhouette made up for all the covering.Her make-up was equally fierce, rocking dark lips and smokey eyes.siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
