CRUCIAL services would not be affected by the public transport protests, according to authorities in Matatiele, Eastern Cape.The Matatiele local municipality leadership today facilitated negotiations the whole day with the relevant stakeholders, with the aim of stopping the protests that are under way in and around Matatiele.Delegated by the MEC for roads and public works Thandiswa Marawu, the Alfred Nzo executive mayor councillor Sixolile Mehlomakhulu engaged the Route 56 Matatiele Forum, local taxi associations and other relevant role players on planned interventions in response to the grievances of the protesters.This follows a three-day protest action that saw certain major roads barricaded, causing traffic and operations disruptions. Among others, the protesters are frustrated about the unbearable condition of roads in and around Matatiele.They said their attempts to get the local department of roads and public works to attend to their request have failed. In the presence of the traditional leadership, officials from the department of roads and public works, SAPS and the department of education, the public transport operators agreed to reduce the impact of the strike action.This means emergency services and other crucial services such as scholar transportation will not be affected by the strike. Initially, the public transport industry wanted a complete shutdown in taxi operations or a response in 24 hours, but later reviewed its decision to allow a seven-day period for interventions and a response from MEC Marawu.Matatiele local municipality mayor Momelezi Mbedla said: We are confident that we will find a lasting solution to these issues.As demonstrated today, we have taken it upon ourselves as the municipality, the responsibility of facilitating engagements between all the relevant stakeholders. The municipality would like to appeal to all those affected to be patient and allow the interventions to take place undisturbed.The strike is peaceful and the local SAPS has increased visibility in all affected areas. Although some public transport operators have suspended operations, community members are encouraged to make use of alternative routes and other means of transport.Affected routes include Maluti to Qacha s Nek, Sam Kerk to Ongeluksnek, Matatiele route via Swartberg, Khoapa to Nkau and St Paul, Maluti to Nchodu, Maluti to Makhoba and Matatiele road to Masakala.
