It is the first of the 2017 flagship phones worthy your attention. Its FullVision display with narrow bezel in premium metal and glass body elevates LG G6 into the next generation of smartphone design.The 18:9 aspect ratio and QHD Plus resolution allow superior picture quality for a more engaging viewing experience. The G6 is, like the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy S8, water and dust-proof. What also makes the LGG6 standout is that it is covered in a mix of glass and metal, with two sheets of Gorilla Glass and framed with a rim of aluminium. Its design is classically modest yet the most sophisticated phone we ve ever seen from LG.Some LG phone lovers will be surprised to find that the battery is now sealed into the handset, LG has finally given up on the removable power pack in order to put in a more powerful and slimmer juice unit. It has also been increased to 3 300mAh within the slimmer 7.9mm frame.This much-awaited device is now available to South African consumers on contract, bundled with a 64GB SD Card and Tone Ultra Headphones from Vodacom, MTN and Telkom.
