IRAQI forces yesterday were searching neighbourhoods of west Mosul they retook weeks ago after a surprise jihadist attack on their rear that left several dead, officials said.The attack, which was claimed by the Islamic State group (Isis), sowed panic among residents who had returned to live in the Tanak and Yarmuk neighbourhoods of west Mosul.A top commander in the Counter Terrorism Service (CTS), which sent forces to fight the Isis gunmen, said the attackers had infiltrated the area by blending in with returning displaced civilians. The group came with the displaced and settled in the Tanak district.They regrouped and launched counterattacks, Staff Lt-Gen Abdulwahab al-Saadi said. Yarmuk is being searched house to house, he said, adding that two groups of Isis attackers were still believed to be in the area, which lies on the western edge of the city.A CTS medic said the attack had caused several victims but he could not say how many. There are martyrs who were killed by Daesh, the medic said, using an Arabic acronym for Isis. He said 15 to 20 jihadist fighters were also killed in the battle.Iraqi forces, led by the CTS, have for a week been pressing a perilous assault into the Old City in central Mosul, the last pocket controlled by the jihadists. Federal forces backed a US-led coalition launched an offensive to retake the country s second city from Isis more than eight months ago.The east bank of Mosul, a city divided by the Tigris River, was retaken in January and a push to wrest back the western side was launched in mid-February.More than 800000 people have been displaced from the Mosul area since October last year and the security forces are struggling to carry out effective screening. Hundreds of families, who in some cases had returned to their homes weeks ago, fled the area again overnight, fearing the return of jihadist rule. AFP
