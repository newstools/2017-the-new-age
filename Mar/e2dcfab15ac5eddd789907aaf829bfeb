Egypt&#8217;s ousted president Hosni Mubarak left a military hospital on Friday where he had spent much of his six-year detention, his lawyer said.Mubarak had been cleared for release earlier this month after a top court finally acquitted him of involvement in protester deaths during the 2011 revolt that ousted him.&#8221;Yes,&#8221; his lawyer Farid al-Deeb told AFP when asked if Mubarak had left the hospital on Friday.Mubarak was accused of inciting the deaths of protesters during the 18-day revolt, in which about 850 people were killed as police clashed with demonstrators.He was sentenced to life in 2012 in the case, but an appeals court ordered a retrial which dismissed the charges two years later.Egypt&#8217;s top appeals court on March 2 acquitted him of involvement in the killings.In January 2016, the appeals court upheld a three-year prison sentence for Mubarak and his two sons on corruption charges.But the sentence took into account time served. Both of his sons, Alaa and Gamal, were freed.On Thursday, a court ordered a renewed corruption investigation into Mubarak for allegedly receiving gifts from the state owned Al-Ahram newspaper.Meanwhile several key activists in the 2011 uprising are now serving lengthy jail terms, and rights groups say hundreds of others have been forcibly disappeared.-AFP
