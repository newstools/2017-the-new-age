Outspoken ANC MP Makhosi Khoza said on Sunday that &#8220;it is dangerous to be a member of the ANC if you do not protect corruption&#8221;.Khoza wrote this on her Facebook page on Sunday as the proceeding for her disciplinary got underway without her in KwaZulu-Natal. She is facing two counts of ill-discipline for statements made on her Facebook posts and remarks she made at a Save SA organised Conference in July. The disciplinary was postponed until September 17.&#8220;In fact today, I feel sad that had (Sindiso) Magaqa probably left (the ANC) with (Julius) Malema, he would not be dead today. It is very dangerous to be a member of the ANC today if you do not protect corruption,&#8221; she said, referring to Malema&#8217;s expulsion from the ANC.She claimed the party protects those who do not say anything against corruption and punishes those who speak out. &#8220;Those who fight corruption are persecuted. Why was Comrade Senzo Mchunu removed as a Premier? He could not tolerate corruption,&#8221; she said.Then speaking of herself in the third person she continued:&#8221;Why is Makhosi Khoza persecuted? She hates corruption.Corruption is a major contributor to the psychological defeat of our black African children,&#8221; she said.Khosa says that she knows of the possibility of being expelled from the ANC, however, remains unapologetic on her beliefs.She was expected to attend the DC on Sunday, however, only her representatives arrived.&#8220;By the end of today, I may possibly be stripped of my black, green and gold brand. I do not mind. I joined the ANC because of the love I have for my country and its people,&#8221; she saidThe MP further added that she would accept whatever outcome of the DC and she would be free to &#8220;exercise her constitutional right to moral conscience.&#8221;&#8220;If we disagree on this fundamental point of convergence I have no business to be in that organisation because that which has bound us for 35 years has been broken. I shall never trade truth with a job, position, brand or anything. Whatever outcome I&#8217;ll accept with both hands and be free to exercise my constitutional right to moral conscience. Yes! I will rise. I&#8217;m ahead,&#8221; said Khoza.The facebook post by Khoza ,who is has been branded amongst the strongest critics of President Jacob Zuma has received enormous attention including a comment from former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor who has wished her well ahead of the DC.&#8220;Praying for you,&#8221; she said. The ANC in KZN continued with the disciplinary. Khoza said she could not get a flight to KZN in time. She has also said she has been threatened for her views.-TNA Reporter
