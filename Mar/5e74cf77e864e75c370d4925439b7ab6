Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez won his party&#8217;s primary on Sunday, raising his hopes of winning re-election in November 26 polls despite a constitutional one-term limit.Hernandez got 222,759 votes against 17,461 for his only contender, Roberto Ramon Castillo, to get the presidential nomination from the ruling, right-leaning National Party (PN), according to a partial count announced by Supreme Electoral Tribunal president Erik Rodriguez.Seventeen parties fielded candidates in Honduras&#8217;s party primaries on for local councils, national and Central American lawmakers, three vice presidents and for the post of president.All of Honduras&#8217; 5.8 million registered voters were invited to cast votes in Sunday&#8217;s primary.Scholar Luis Zelaya stood as candidate for the center-right Liberal Party (PL), obtaining 98,739 votes. His rival, economist Gabriela Nunez, took in 55,270 votes.One of the president&#8217;s challengers will be Xiomara Castro, the wife of Manuel Zelaya, a former president who was ousted by the military in 2009 as he tried to change the constitution in a way many suspected was meant to let him stay in power beyond one term.She won the leftist Liberty and Refoundation&#8217;s nomination with 117,461 votes, against 4,222 for Rasel Tome. The party is also known as Libre.&#8220;Hondurans have given a lesson in civility,&#8221; Hernandez said in a speech, in which he promised to &#8220;continue the changes that the country needs&#8221; in the next four years, especially in fighting crime.Hernandez&#8217;s bid for a new four-year mandate at the head of the ruling National Party is buoyed by a Supreme Court ruling two years ago discarding the term-limit clause in the 1982 constitution.-AFP
