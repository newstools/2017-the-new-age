Chelsea delivered the perfect response to Tottenham Hotspur by winning 3-1 at Bournemouth on Saturday to restore their seven-point lead at the top of the Premier League table.Antonio Conte&#8217;s men went ahead after 17 minutes when Bournemouth&#8217;s Adam Smith deflected in Diego Costa&#8217;s shot and Eden Hazard made it 2-0 within a minute.Joshua King halved the deficit just before half-time, but Marcos Alonso made it 3-1 with a perfectly flighted free kick after 68 minutes.Tottenham had trimmed Chelsea&#8217;s advantage to four points by crushing Watford 4-0 earlier in the day, but Chelsea&#8217;s victory left them seven points clear with seven games of the season remaining.However, they were almost a goal down in the first minute.Bournemouth midfielder Ryan Fraser curled a cross into the six-yard area and David Luiz, perhaps blinded by the low sun, sliced his attempt at a volleyed clearance back towards his own net.It looked a certain goal until goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois flung out his left arm to divert the ball for a corner-kick.But Chelsea recovered their composure quickly and took the lead, just after Jack Wilshere &#8212; on loan to Bournemouth from Arsenal &#8212; had created a chance for Fraser that he put well wide.Luiz began the move with a pass out to Victor Moses on the right. His low ball inside found Costa, who turned and shot left-footed.His mishit effort was going well wide until it grazed the head of right-back Smith, who was attempting to block, and dropped gently inside the post with goalkeeper Artur Boruc hopelessly wrong-footed.Costa had not scored in his previous four appearances for Chelsea, but manager Conte had expressed his confidence in the forward as a scorer and creator of goals. This was vindication of a sort.A minute later it was 2-0 after Wilshere lost possession in midfield and N&#8217;Golo Kante sent Hazard through.&#8211; Fortune shines on Courtois &#8211;Just onside, Hazard ran on, feinted to shoot to the goalkeeper&#8217;s right, went round him to his left and rolled the ball into the net despite appearing to stumble.It might have been three after 27 minutes when Alonso&#8217;s clever pass gave Hazard the chance to cross from the left, but when the ball reached Costa, he shot well wide.That might have proved a costly miss as the home side went close to a goal 60 seconds later.Striker Benik Afobe charged unmarked into space to meet Charlie Daniels&#8217;s cross from the left, only to volley against the inside of the post.The ball rebounded across goal, but a fortunate touch off Courtois&#8217;s leg took it away from King, who would otherwise have had an almost unmissable chance.It was a sign that Bournemouth were in no mood to surrender to the league leaders and they pulled a goal back three minutes before the interval.King took Afobe&#8217;s pass and, as defenders retreated, tried a shot. The ball flicked off the thigh of Luiz and zipped high between Courtois and his near post.Fraser hit a low shot just wide as Bournemouth looked for an equaliser early in the second half, but Costa missed two good chances to restore Chelsea&#8217;s two-goal advantage.First he just failed to get his head to Hazard&#8217;s volleyed cross and then he missed Alonso&#8217;s low cross from a yard out.However, he contributed to Chelsea&#8217;s third goal when he was fouled 22 yards out by Steve Cook.Alonso capped an excellent performance with a precise free-kick that soared over the wall and found the top-right corner of the net with Boruc rooted to his line.Boruc, though, did well to deny Chelsea a fourth with a one-handed save from Moses.-AFP
