Parents have been urged to refrain from taking their children to traditional healers for muti purposes when they are suspected of being involved in criminal activities.Such behaviour of protecting criminals encouraged crime and defeated the ends of justice, community safety, security and liaison MEC Pat Ngomane said.Ngomane condemned the use of muthi to protect criminals at the safety and security imbizo in Leandra outside Secunda at the weekend.He said perpetrators deserved to be kept in custody instead of continuing to undermine other people s rights by terrorising them. I am calling on parents to stop taking their children who committed crime to traditional healers for protection. The fight against crime can never be won if there are people who are still protecting criminals instead of surrendering them to the police, Ngomane said.He said people should build a strong relationship with the police and act against lawbreakers. Parents and those protecting criminals using muti are defeating the ends of justice and as a result perpetrating crime. What kind of parents are those who hide criminals in their homes while innocent community members become victims of their children s doings? We don t want to kill them but to keep them in a place where their morals will be regenerated. So we ask you as parents to please surrender them to us, Ngomane said.Provincial police commissioner Lt-Gen Mondli Zuma appealed to residents to report police officers colluding with criminals. He said corrupt police officers needed to be removed from the police force. We are making a call to the community members to report any corrupt activity by police officers. We are also pleading with the community members to register as police reservists to assist in crime prevention as the number of police officers was very small to attend to the millions of people in the country, Zuma said.FRANCE NYAKAfrancen@thenewage.co.za
