Canadian singer Shania Twain has revealed that her latest album, &#8220;Now,&#8221; will release September 29, and she&#8217;s shared its first single, &#8220;Life&#8217;s About to Get Good.&#8221;Twain previously teased the album in social media posts with the hashtag #SummerofShania and revealed the official news of its release on June 15 with the message &#8220;The day is finally here!!&#8221; along with the LP&#8217;s cover art and a pre-order link.The five-time Grammy winner previously said about writing the single: &#8220;I was at home looking out at the ocean and I said to myself, &#8216;Here I am stuck in this past of negativity, but it&#8217;s so beautiful out. I&#8217;m not in the mood to write a &#8216;feeling-sorry-for-myself&#8217; song.&#8221;She continued, &#8220;You can&#8217;t have the good without the bad. And that&#8217;s what the song ended up being about.&#8221;The long-awaited LP will be Twain&#8217;s fifth, and the first in 15 years &#8212; her fourth studio album, &#8220;Up!,&#8221; dates back to 2002.A track listing, as well as supporting tour dates, have yet to be announced.Pre-order the album via: shaniatwain.lnk.to/NOWListen to &#8220;Life&#8217;s About to Get Good&#8221; at: www.youtube.com/watch?v=QywbFhmmr3s
