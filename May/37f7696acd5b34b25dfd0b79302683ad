The police must take a blame for the killing of an infant after inhaling teargas during the protest march organised by the Abahlali Basemjondolo (Shark Dwellers) in Durban on Monday, National Freedom Party (NFP) provincial chairperson Vikizitha Mlotshwa said today.A two-week old baby boy died allegedly after inhaling tear gas fired by the police during a service delivery protest yesterday.&#8220;We want to question the role of the police especially when it comes to dealing with protest marches.It seems as if police are becoming the worse enemy of our people. Instead of protecting ordinary citizens who demand the promised services by ANC government, the police seem to be acting as the enemy of the people,&#8221;Mlotshwa said.He added: Police officers who are hired based on merits could analyse the environment before brutally attacking protesters,&#8221; he said.The Abahlali baseMjondolo shack dwellers movement had organised a road blockade yesterday after their demands for service delivery were not met a week ago.In a statement released by the shack dwellers, the movement claimed that that they have been waiting for electricity and proper housing for more than 20 years.Little Jayden Khoza was lying inside the shack when a canister exploded next his shack.&#8220;We also blame the system and manner in which these police are hired through improper selection processes.It is unjustifiable that innocent baby could be killed by the police in this manner, Mlothswa said.SAPS spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said at they would not comment at this stage. At this point we cannot confirm if the baby was indeed killed by a teargas. We are waiting for the postmortem report. However, if it happens that the teargas caused his death, then the IPID will be informed to carry out an investigation into the death&#8221;. Zwane said.&#8220;We also call on for the institution of the commission of enquiry of why the police opted for teargas instead of water tanks to separate protesters,&#8221;Mlotshwa said.TNA Reporter
