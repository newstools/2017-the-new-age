The US Senate on Monday easily confirmed Sonny Perdue, the son of a farmer, as the next secretary of agriculture, filling one of the few remaining vacancies in President Donald Trump&#8217;s cabinet after a long delay.Perdue, a 70-year-old former two-term governor of the state of Georgia who grew up on a dairy farm, earned substantial bipartisan support and was confirmed by a vote of 87 to 11.Senator David Perdue, the nominee&#8217;s first cousin, voted present.Perdue, a Republican, will take charge of the nation&#8217;s food and farm programs, a hefty job in the best of times but one in which he now will have to juggle the White House&#8217;s proposed 21-percent cut in US Department of Agriculture programs.Furthermore, Mexico, which has bristled at Trump&#8217;s harsh talk on trade and his call for scrapping or renegotiating NAFTA, has threatened to stop importing billions of dollars&#8217; worth of US corn.Senator Debbie Stabenow, the top Democrat on the agriculture committee, which needs to craft a new farm bill over the coming year, warned that Trump&#8217;s slow pace in nominating Perdue and preparing his paperwork shows the president has treated rural America as &#8220;an afterthought.&#8221;&#8220;Governor Perdue&#8217;s leadership is desperately needed,&#8221; said Stabenow, who voted for the nominee.Two cabinet nominees are still awaiting Senate confirmation: Alex Acosta, who if confirmed as secretary of labor would be the only Hispanic American in the cabinet, and Robert Lighthizer for US trade representative.-AFP
