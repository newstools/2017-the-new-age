Some banks are keeping the young and the poor out of the property market by not granting home loans in certain areas, says Hendrik Pieterse, a manager at Leapfrog Property. Pieterse says the “red lining” of residential areas is never admitted by banks. “They accept bond applications and just decline them. The areas they deemed too risky tend to be close to townships, areas of high crime and the like,” he said. But Jan le Roux, CEO of Real Estate Business Owners of South Africa (Rebosa), says: “One can never force a bank to lend money when the risk factors are out of the ordinary.” “While the position of the banks is understandable, red lining means sellers can’t sell and buyers can’t buy due to a lack of funds, he said. “We often list a property in our area (Eerste Rivier) but the valuators from certain banks will devalue the property in their estimates, which in my opinion is wrong,” Le Roux said. “Younger people find it hard to get a house in the areas they grew up in because the banks decide for them by denying their home loan application, especially if there are RDP houses near the property. “Where banks can do so much better is to be honest about specific areas, saying that they’ve had bad experiences and so on and, instead of outright refusing the application, can offer alternatives such as asking for higher deposits, a lower ratio of what the purchaser is allowed to borrow or insisting on a collateral investment from a family member for example to reduce the banks’ risk,” he said. He says agents operating in problematic areas can also show their commitment to the neighbourhood by investing 50% of their commission as a collateral investment in the loan. “Collateral investments are always for a specific time frame and the funds will be reimbursed after a certain period, once the bank’s risk has been sufficiently lowered. I believe that this shows a tremendous amount of faith in the area by the agent,” Le Roux said. -SELLO RABOTHATA|sellor@thenewage.co.za
