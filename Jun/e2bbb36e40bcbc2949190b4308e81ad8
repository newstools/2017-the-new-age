African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) president Collen Maine says if Police Minister Fikile Mbalula is not available for the second deputy secretary they will look for a replacement.Maine s utterances are in response to Mbalula&#8217;s tweet in which he claimed that if the Free State Premier Ace Magashule were elected ANC&#8217;s secreatry-general, this would &#8220;kill&#8221; what was left of the party.Mbalula urged the ANCYL to rather rally behind Gauteng Premier David Makhura for the position.But Maine did not take kindly to Mbalula&#8217;s comments, and cautioned Mbalula not to want to run the ANCYL &#8220;from the grave&#8221;. He had his time as the president (ANCYL) and we never interfered with his leadership. I think we clearly got the message that he won t be available to serve the ANC, Maine said.He said it was improper for Mbalula to attack in public another comrade s character. He said the youth league was confident in the leadership of Magashule, and did not believe that he would &#8220;kill the organisation&#8221;. To denegrade another comrade is not okay. We still believe Ace will not kill the ANC, Maine said.&nbsp;Magashule s spokesperson Tiisetso Makhele said Mbalula&#8217;s statement was unfortunate and &#8220;not scientific and factual&#8221;. He said for a long time Magashule had been in power, leading the Free State provincial legislature with distinction and &#8220;has never killed or attempted to kill the movement&#8221;.-Sipho Jack
