The recent pushback against the amended Mining Charter, public prosecutor s Busisiwe Mkhwebane s call to reorientate the Reserve Bank and Prof Chris Malikane s proposals on how we should transform the economy has been vicious, immediate and menacing.What this has shown us is that there are still deep-seated sentiments and strong opposition to economic transformation in this country from white monopoly capital.The media coverage has shown us the institutionalised attitudes of corporate commercial media and how little, overall, the well being of the people matter in our public discourse.This also has also reminded us, even those who were in doubt that the balance of class forces are decisively in favour of white monopoly capital, whose interests are intertwined with those of imperialism both economically and politically.Black South Africans who were brutally killed for their land centuries ago bent over backwards to accommodate their oppressors after the 1994 democratic breakthrough and only demanded 30% of the land despite being the majority in this country.Yet nearly quarter of a century later, the issue of land reform is still a contentious issue because white interests are not prepared to let go of the land. The amended charter harter is only talking about the ownership target of 30% for black citizens.Mkhwebane and Malikane are arguing that a system that only works for a minority should be transformed to accommodate the majority.Despite these two intellectually employed individuals having been entrusted with esteemed positions of responsibility in their respective fields because of their qualifications and experience, as soon as they talked about the transformation of the institutions that alienate the majority from the mainstream economy, they are treated like semi-illiterate imbeciles by the the media.We have also seen acres and acres of space in the media dedicated to anti-NHI and antiminimum wage rhetoric and propaganda, with some authoritative research institutions funded by big business denouncing the progressive positions adopted by ANC conferences and tripartite alliance summits, while the unaccountable ratings agencies play their oversight role in all of this.This is happening at a time when South Africa is said to have the highest jobless rate of more than 60 emerging and developed countries in the world.At the same time the same big business that resists economic transformation is unrelenting in their ongoing investment strike.Last year big business boasted that they had an estimated cash of close to R600bn in deposits in South African banks; and that this has increased since the 2008 financial crisis.Despite the loss of one million jobs due to the 2008 global economic crisis, companies have continued to increase their profits. But according to data from the South African Reserve Bank, as of December 2014, corporate cash balances had reached R1.35 trillion. This amount is the equivalent of 38% of SA s gross domestic product that big business is refusing to invest back into the economy despite retrenchments and economic stagnation.They argue that there currently exists policy uncertainty .This is surprising given the government has adopted the National Development Plan, the New Growth Path and the Industrial Policy Action Plans. And this is despite big business represented as one of the social partners at Nedlac where they can engage on policy matters.Instead of increasing their investment in SA, most local companies, such as Life Healthcare and Steinhoff are investing in developed countries such as Britain and Australia.All of this, combined with the excessive price fixing and collusion by many companies, as exposed by the Competition Commission s investigations, show us that South Africa has a big task to tame the monster that is the country s unregulated free market capitalism.If the ANC conference, which is scheduled for the end of this month, is not going to address the problem of an unregulated capitalism then it will be a waste of time.While the ANC discussion document acknowledges that we cannot rely on the market to radically transform the economy, the policy proposals seeks to entrench the unregulated nature of our capitalist system, which is a big problem.In Malaysia, before the government introduced a new economic policy. they had to be forced by violence meted out against the elite Chinese Malay group.Prior to the 70s, Malaysia was focused on growth and exports and neglected empowering the indigenous Malay majority. It was only after riots that the Malay government introduced the new economic policy which sought to increase state intervention in the economy and to introduce redistributive economic policies such as affirmative action and quotas. The ANC has the advantage that it can learn from the experience of countries such as Malaysia.The ANC s trickle-down economic growth policies have failed the black majority and must be abandoned now before it is too late. The ANC has been much more prudential than doctrinaire in its governing model and has been confrontation averse and not willing to swing the big axe, but if the intransigence coming from big business is anything to go by, a change of tactics from the ANC is needed.We have already seen campuses in ferment with the students demanding free education and the tragedies like in Marikana are a reminder of what happens when the private sector is unwilling to accede to the demands of the poor majority; the government gets thrown under the bus.The ANC would therefore do well to use this upcoming policy conference to deal with its factional divisions before they become irreversible and also sort out corruption that is becoming endemic within the state and the organs of state because all of these things are driving many of its loyal supporters and even well-meaning activists into the hands of the enemy.This will go a long way in rearranging the balance of class forces away from white monopoly capital.For now, it is patently clear that a paralysed ANC with its demoralised mass base will come second best against white monopoly capital that is hell-bent on defending its inherited privileges and ill-gotten wealth.Sdumo DlaminiSdumo Dlamini is president of Cosatu.
