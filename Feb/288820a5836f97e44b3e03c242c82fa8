Punters in gambling-mad Vietnam cheered the easing of a ban on sports betting Saturday, as the communist government moves to bring a booming black market industry above board.Vietnam has long barred locals from gambling of any form, allowing only a few foreigner-only casinos. But the law is widely flouted &#8212; especially in the run-up to major sporting events &#8212; when millions of dollars change hands through illegal gambling dens or online betting rings.On Friday the government announced a pilot program that would allow Vietnamese citizens over the age of 21 to place wagers on international football matches. It follows a similar announcement last month that said citizens would be permitted to hedge bets in local casinos from mid-March.&#8220;The matches and tournaments for international football betting must be recognised by FIFA,&#8221; the new decree said, adding that gambling would also be allowed at horse and greyhound races. But there is one catch &#8212; the football bets cannot top more than one million dong ($44) per match, a limit that is unlikely to satiate Vietnam&#8217;s most passionate punters.The betting will also be restricted to state-approved bookmakers. The announcement was nevertheless welcomed by many in Vietnam, where football and a flutter go hand-in-hand as national obsessions.&#8220;Bravo! No need for secret betting,&#8221; online commentator Nguyen Thanh Phuc wrote beneath an article on the state-run VnExpress that hailed the move as a &#8220;historic decision&#8221;.Yet some expressed concern that gambling, long branded a &#8220;social evil&#8221; by the government, would now run wild in a country where punters are already known for staking their savings &#8212; and even their homes &#8212; on big tournaments.&#8220;Gamblers now have another thing to play. Many families will be miserable again,&#8221; wrote Tran Phuc.The moves to ease Vietnam&#8217;s strict betting and casino bans come after years of debating whether to legalise gambling and open the government up to millions in potential tax revenue.-AFP
