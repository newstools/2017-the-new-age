Is the South African Communist Party (SACP) truly a vanguard party?As his battle with the SACP reached its climax and in the eye of the storm, Thabo Mbeki at the ANC s 52nd national conference, had the boldness to quote Vladimir Lenin: Better fewer but better. He uttered these words as he faced the democratic tide against him at the Polokwane conference. Vintage Mbeki, he tried to corner the conference. If he was reelected, well then so be it.Yet if he lost, it was because they were dealing with, as he said in his political report: Members who, among other things, will have very little familiarity with the history and traditions of the ANC, its policies, its value system and its organisational practices. Both ways, he attempted to write history. Cloaked in Shakespearean irony, Mbeki s call was directed mainly to his Leninist-Marxist opponents in the form of the SACP and Cosatu.Ironically, like the ANC a decade ago, the SACP finds itself today in the same conundrum. Historically, known as a vanguard , therefore fewer but better, the SACP today boasted at its latest congress, a membership tally of a quarter million.The reality of course, as Mbeki tried to project in 2007 and which Lenin fully understood, was concentration on the increase in numbers meant the decrease in content and character.A vanguard, while open to all, is simply not a mass-based organisation.Referring to his work titled, How We Should Reorganise the Workers and Peasants Inspection, Lenin cautioned against thinking that the figures mentioned in that article were too small. Rather he suggests that the measures to be put in place must ensure that really exemplary quality is obtained. Ultimately, the establishment of the vanguard is in response to his question, What is to be Done?The reality is that under the leadership of Blade Nzimande, a direct onslaught against the bourgeois intelligentsia, to which Marx and Engels were said to have belonged to, has taken place.Throughout the last two decades, there has been a deliberate purging of leading intellectuals within the party and a move towards one that is mass-based. It is not necessary to name these intellectuals here, suffice to say that anyone who has knowledge of the party would be able to identify them.This dearth in leadership in the SACP has led directly to a dearth in ideas. One such example of the lack of ideas is summed up in the following paragraph: (The) intention was not to decide on whether the SACP should stand for elections or not (that decision is a foregone conclusion), this is not because of the number of people who attended, but because of the prevailing conditions that arise in the phase of the revolution. The decision to constitute a commission to look into the pros and cons of standing for elections was not a cowing out of a yes we will or no we won t response. This is based on the fact that the question was not whether we should, but was whether if we do, how will we do it, when will we do it and how will this affect the alliance between the SACP with Cosatu and the ANC. You would be forgiven if you thought this was a summary of the decision by the party to investigate modalities of participation in elections taken at its last congress held just last July. Sadly, this was a response by the SACP to a Business Day editorial in 2005 after the party s special national congress. Nearly 12 years on to the day, the SACP is stuck in the same place. Where is the vanguard?In other words, for over a decade now, the party, which portrays itself as the vanguard of the workers, has been threatening to go it alone as the Business Day editorial was titled.Since that special national congress, the SACP has become emboldened to add to its membership, increase to an operating budget of R35m with R2m spent on securing party bosses alone.The central committee boasts no less than five ministers in Jacob Zuma s Cabinet, two provincial premiers, five deputy ministers, three members of the executive councils, the deputy speaker of the National Assembly, eight MPs mostly holding senior positions, two members of provincial legislatures, a deputy mayor, and two senior bureaucrats. They are all in their positions on an ANC ticket.Therefore, it is safe to suggest that while there has been a purge of the intelligentsia from the vanguard there has also been a push to ensure that certain leaders benefit from patronage politics.We see this for example in the deployment to university and TVET college councils where members of the party are deployed and while these deployees have meant very little on these councils, as seen with #FeesMustFall, they continue to draw the benefits that accompany these posts.This inability to lead university councils during the protests and what was subsequently articulated as the dysfunctionality of university governance is indicative of the poor performance by a communist minister.One is not sure how Lenin would respond to the purging of intellectuals from the party in the last two decades and the subsequent dearth of ideas that have prevailed.What is certain is that Marx, together with Oliver Tambo and JB Marks, would definitely raise an eyebrow at the SACP of today for they have committed a treasonous sin the commodification of the tripartite alliance.Khalid Sayed is Western Cape chairperson of the ANC Youth League
