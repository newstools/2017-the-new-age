THE South African Football Association (Safa) is expected to appoint a foreign coach to replace sacked Shakes Mashaba, The New Age has reliably learnt.However, reports emerged that Mashaba had taken the matter of his dismissal to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA).Mashaba, who was found guilty of gross misconduct, is seeking to bar Safa from appointing a new coach while the matter of his dismissal is due to go before the CCMA.The latest developments regarding Safa s preferred candidate will no doubt come as a blow to Roger de Sa, who went public to declare his desire to land the Bafana Bafana coaching job after Mashaba was placed on suspension following his attack on his employers last month in Limpopo.The football public are awaiting with bated breath the news of Mashaba s successor, particularly as Bafana are busy with 2018 World Cup qualifiers.Danny Jordaan is expected to hold a final meeting with Safa members at Safa House next week to decide on who will lead the national team.A source, who is a member of the Safa national executive committee, said the mother body has decided to go for a foreign coach since targeted local coaches are tied up in lengthy contracts at their clubs.He said De Sa would be overlooked because he is inexperienced at international level . Look, Roger may have taken Orlando Pirates to the CAF Africa Champions League final, but he has shortcomings. Also, he made things worse by pronouncing to the media his wish to coach Bafana Bafana while the decision on Mashaba had yet to be taken, the source said.The source said Safa had targeted Bidvest Wits coach Gavin Hunt and was undecided on whether to bring back Pitso Mosimane, who led Mamelodi Sundowns to African success.The informant said foreign coaches targeted include Milutin Micho Sredojevic, Herve Renard and Florent Ibenge.LINDA XIMBA news@thenewage.co.za&nbsp;
