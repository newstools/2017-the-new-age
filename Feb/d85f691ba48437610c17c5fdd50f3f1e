He used his finger, though not in the belligerent manner favoured by former apartheid leader PW Botha but to gently make a point as he gave his 2017 Budget Speech.That was Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan who was in fine fettle in a joint sitting of Parliament yesterday. Scheduled to speak at 2pm, Gordhan confidently entered the House, but could not immediately start with the business of the day.He was delayed. But unlike President Jacob Zuma who has had his visits to the house ambushed by the EFF, Gordhan was the recipient of what can be called effusive praise delivered from the public gallery by an imbongi who was wearing brown animal skins.He was also given peals of applause by MPs before he spoke. The loudest appreciation came from the six percent party in red, the EFF, which deliberately made the same point about their enthusiastic support for him when he left the Chamber shortly after 3.30pm.But this time, the lasting picture was that of Number One and Number Two, President Zuma and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, standing side-by-side, laughing and clapping their handsGordhan gave his Budget in his normal style: ribbing colleagues when they missed a point, asking Members of Parliament to applaud when he thought he deserved some plaudits and also sharing advice he had received in the mail.As he was concluding his remarks, Gordhan thanked President Zuma for his support. EFF MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi wasn t happy with this show of appreciation and raised a point of order to object. Speaker Baleka Mbete, off course, dismissed him.His thanking his Deputy Mcebisi Jonas evoked two rounds of applause: the first one when he mentioned the Deputy Finance Minister s name, and the second when he named him again after he had resumed his speech.Clearly he was a Finance Minister who could do no wrong on the day. -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
