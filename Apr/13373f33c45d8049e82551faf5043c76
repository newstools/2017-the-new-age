The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) on Wednesday announced that it has recalled the book allowances for two students from the University of Venda.This comes after an investigation of several incidents of fraud involving some students from the university who were found selling their NSFAS allowance vouchers for cash.NSFAS spokesperson Kagisho Mamabolo said: &#8220;we would like to express our disappointment at these irresponsible actions, especially by students who went on violent protests because they had not yet received their allowances for books and meals.&#8220;In an effort to respond speedily to their plight earlier this month, NSFAS met with the university officials to speed up the process to allocate allowances to qualifying students through the sBux system,&#8221; he said.Mamabolo said by the 12th of April 2017 they had disbursed allowances for books and food to the value of R2 818 813.00 to over 10 000 students at the university. However, some students immediately started to sell their allowances publicly at discounted amounts on the same day, &#8220;this is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.&#8221;NSFAS said it will use the funds to subsidise other needy students.&#8220;It is important to note that allowances are allocated to students according to their financial needs as reported to NSFAS by their institutions and supplied by students through their NSFAS application forms.&#8220;These allowances are disbursed to support students through the academic year, and not to be sold to third parties,&#8221; Mamabolo said.Mamabolo advised students to carefully read the sBux terms and conditions as provided in the agreement form, as it is illegal for them to sell their allowances.&#8220;We appeal to the broader student community to report anyone found selling their NSFAS vouchers, we also appeal to Student Representative Councils (SRCs) to take note of these illegal activities by students and make efforts to bring this trend to a stop, because they are the structures students run to when they engage in protests,&#8221; he said.Students are encouraged to contact the Vuvuzela Hotline if they have been victims of or witnessed any manipulation of the sBux system and its allowances.Vuvuzela Hotline 0800 203 900, call back 072 595 9139 or email nsfas@thehotline.co.zaTNA Reporter
