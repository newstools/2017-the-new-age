Without a doubt, all the three pillars of sustainable development economic inclusion, social inclusion and environmental protection hinge on the ICTs (information and communications technology) as key catalysts.The ICTs will be absolutely crucial for achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs) over the next 13 years.The commendable decision of the high level UN meeting to make ICTs the 17th SDG has put developing countries in a growth trajectory, which radically and speedily grows across interracial and gender divides.Goal 5, which says Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls is even more intriguing.In ICT, we have a powerful tool to advance women s rights, empowerment and gender equality.But it is common knowledge that poor or inadequate infrastructure has, for so long, stood as a barrier to an inclusive growth and development revolution.And with that in mind, the million-dollar question is whether the digital revolution and the world s information society agenda will give us radical shifts and greater impact in our desired outcomes?Undoubtedly, the digital future establishes a new agenda for the future.Traditionally, universities, and other institutions and centres of learning, were identified with knowledge and skills production.And clearly the SDG targets impact can only be realised through an integrated action plan over the next decade.The future demands for high levels of disruption, including re-engineering of skills and training for a digitised ecosystem.Faculties, which never had data laws, have to begin preparing students in partnership with faculties of computer science and other related departments of economics.Empowerment of the activities of the digital future have to all share the growing pain of mastering technology for not only knowledge economy, but also for manufacturing, automation and robotics capabilities.The value of these new possibilities is that they dismantle stubborn and perennial foundation of inequalities.In our patriarchal societies, hard labour and other risks associated with poor infrastructure have always been used as an excuse to marginalise women, people in rural communities and the disabled.Our resolve to embrace technology and innovation through partnerships, as envisaged in the National Development Plan, guarantees investors and entrepreneurs a future which is secured and sustainable in our community.The success or greater impact of the digitised and networked society will be felt through training programmes of women.In line with this, the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services launched the South African Woman in ICT (SAWIICT) Forum in 2014.The aim is to promote the advancement and representation of women professionals in the ICT industry as well as provide commentary and suggestions on appropriate legislative and regulatory matters.In fact, this organisation has become a support system for them, but we have also mandated them to be transformation hubs within their organisation ensuring that women are empowered and nurtured for inclusion within the business value chain of the company.The department has since used SAWIICT to further the developmental needs of women and young girls.One of the ground-breaking projects wherein the organisation partnered with the department was through a skills and women empowerment programme which was undertaken in Tlhabane, Rustenburg in the North West province.The website www.lwazi-ict.co.za was especially developed for women in the Tlhabane community.In the process of developing the website 40 women were trained in ICT skills.The training proved to be a huge success as evidenced by the number of women that had already found employment even before the website was launched.The website will also act as a support mechanism for women who have been victims of gender-based violence by providing information of local councillors, police, and support groups in the area to assist those affected.Interestingly, other ICT pace-setters have created mobile phone apps to report safety risks and get access to services for survivors of gender-based violence in a bid to end violence against women.However, the reality out there is that a few people, especially women, will have an engineering degree.The majority will need to acquire specific skills to be able to participate in the knowledge economy.This is necessary to ensure that women from our communities acquire the essential digital skills and benefit from the educational opportunities from our own home-grown agencies like Nemisa and other Universities of Technology thus fostering long-term partnerships with employees, entrepreneurs, facilitating SME opportunities and economic growth.I m reminded of what the late former ANC president, Oliver Reginald Tambo, oncesaid. He said the black population is predominantly landless, property-less and unskilled. It is clear that the skills gap in the ICTs requires pressing attention.In the era where it is possible to get a thousand devices connected, the era of the internet of things, the digitisation of institutions such as the Post Office brings with it ample opportunities.A digitised Post Office, with its enormous footprint, has been identified as one of the structures which should improve access especially for women in the most remote rural areas, townships and informal settlements.In addition to the already existing infrastructure, mobile booths and supermarkets can be used to increase access.The ICT skills we are calling for will also enable women to participate in the economies of scale in a digitised society.Therefore, ICT training for women should specifically focus on internet usage, development of applications, gender specific cyber-security risks and even how to access volumes of information online for effective participation.On the other hand, we ought to understand that ICTs are not only enablers, but they are a pillar of efficient, capable and futuristic societies.ICT use by women will absolutely boost productivity and better meet women s economic and social needs.If properly harnessed, self-generated income from ICT businesses can give women greater mileage to close the gender wage gap in South Africa.Therefore, it is imperative for us to embrace the ICTs and reap of the benefits thereof.Hlengiwe MkhizeProf Hlengiwe Mkhize is the Deputy Minister of the Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services and the national convener of the Progressive Women s Movement of SA
