When a Land Rover Defender 110 4×4 just isn’t enough for your expedition, there’s now an even more hard-core off-roader available in the form of the Kahn Design Flying Huntsman 6×6 Soft-Top. In truth, hard-core is probably a little off the mark with this one as Kahn Design is known for taking Land Rover and Range Rover models to new heights of style and luxury. But as a Land Rover Defender is already renowned as one of the most capable off-roaders ever made, and the 110 versions even more so, a six-wheel drive version of a 110 has to be something that can reach places other off-roaders can’t. From the preview image released by Kahn, it appears the bonnet of the 110 has been stretched to accommodate the 6.2-liter GM LS3 V-8 that develops 430 horsepower the company has decided to use to replace the standard engine in the 110. Of course, the rear has also been stretched, but that’s to make space for the third axel for those extra two wheels to transform the Defender into a 6×6. Kahn Design already offers a Flying Huntsman 6×6, but what makes this one special is the folding soft-top that expands the passenger compartment into what becomes the pickup bed in the existing Flying Huntsman. So, if you’ve been waiting for an alternative to the Mercedes-Maybach G650 Landaulet, here it is. If the petrol LS3 Corvette engine is a little too thirsty for your liking and you prefer something that gets more miles to the gallon, it appears the Flying Huntsman is also available with the original 2.2-liter TDCI diesel engine. As well as getting better fuel economy, it may also mean a small reduction in the £250,000 asking price, but it would probably mean your Huntsman would also be slower too. -Relaxnews
