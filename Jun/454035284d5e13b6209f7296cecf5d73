After Nestor died of a heart attack that year, she defended his legacy and won re-election in 2011.But to her opponents, Kirchner is a bully who steered the economy back into recession and embarrassed the country with attacks against her favorite foes.They included the old Falklands War enemy Britain, big media conglomerates she sought to dismantle, and &#8220;vulture&#8221; fund capitalists who sued Argentina over its defaulted debt.She left office in 2015 &#8212; when term limits barred her from running again &#8212; with an approval rating of more than 50 percent. But she failed to get her chosen successor elected.Argentines voted for the center-right businessman Macri instead.Kirchner now accuses Macri&#8217;s camp of trumping up charges to sideline her from politics.&#8211; Power couple &#8211;Born in La Plata, near Buenos Aires, Kirchner met Nestor as a 20-year-old student and married him six months later.Nestor became governor and Cristina a senator in Santa Cruz province in Patagonia.Cristina Kirchner has sought to channel the legacy of Eva Peron, the first lady of the populist president Juan Peron in the 1940s and 50s.But while many Argentines worship Evita, Kirchner&#8217;s legacy is darker.In one case, she is accused of favoring a construction magnate friend for public contracts in Patagonia.She also stands accused of ordering the central bank to sell dollar futures at artificially low prices, costing Argentina hundreds of millions of dollars.And critics continue to link her to the mysterious 2015 death of Alberto Nisman, a prosecutor who had accused her of obstructing his investigation into a 1994 bombing at a Buenos Aires Jewish center.That case has been thrown out in several courts.Nearly every time Kirchner appears in court, swarms of protesters rally outside in her support.Asked in 2015 how he thought she would spend her post-presidential life, her former chief of staff Anibal Fernandez said she &#8220;won&#8217;t just stay home picking roses or taking care of the grandkids.&#8221;burs-mdo/ecAFP
