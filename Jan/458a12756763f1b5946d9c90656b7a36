The Rob Ferreira Hospital, situated in Mbombela, Mpumalanga, has been there since 1962 and remains a critical pulse in the heartbeat of healthcare.The hospital boasts facilities such as units of urology, obstetrics and orthopaedics, as well as services of dermatology, plastic surgery, general surgery, paediatrics, neonatology and internal medicine, to name but a few.This public facility has varying amounts of patients coming through its doors. There are an estimated 155000 patients in the OPD (Out Patient Department) with 113000 of those patients being admitted. Working in Rob Ferreira Hospital is an enjoyable experience because every day the quality of care is improving, giving us hope that what we are doing for our people is in line with the national Department of Health vision for a long and healthy life for all South Africans, Fridah Nyathi told The New Age.The hospital is a tertiary hospital which has specialist services to the people of Mbombela. It is a practical training facility for medical internship students who aim to acquire their qualification in medicine, Mpumalanga health spokesperson Dumisani Malamule said.The hospital provides much-needed future health professionals a start in the medical sector. The hospital boasts of its improved cleanliness of wards in general. A gastroenterology clinic has been boosted with a state of the art gastrostomy machine and an appointment of a gastroenterology specialist to manage patients with gastroenterology problems, Malamule said. The hospital also boasts a state of art resource centre which is used as a training facility for nursing students. Major developments have occurred in 2016, helping push the services to greater proficiency.These include the opening of a renal clinic last May ensuring that patients needing dialysis in the province are assisted.The appointment of two orthopaedic specialists to join the one they already had, reducing the orthopaedic waiting time for operations.And finally a plastic surgery clinic has been opened with outreach conducted at the Themba Hospital.The hospital has been in the news for the wrong reasons such as a strike taking place in November last year when staff members reportedly closed all entrances and exits demanding new uniforms, cleaning materials and compensation for overtime worked.After the protest had turned violent, the MEC for health in the department said that the department would like to apologise to the public for any inconvenience caused during the strike and would like to assure all citizens that it is committed to providing better healthcare.TNA REPORTERprovinces@thenewage.co.za
