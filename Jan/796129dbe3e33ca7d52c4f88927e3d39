NELSON Mandela Metropolitan University s first-year students received a sobering welcome to the institution past weekend as vice-chancellor Prof Derrick Swartz highlighted the opportunities, challenges, rights and responsibilities over the next few years.In an address live streamed to various venues across NMMU campuses, Swartz expressed his excitement at having the new students join the institution. Being a first year is probably the most exciting part about being at a university as a new world is being opened up to them, he said. There is a rich opportunity to gain a unique qualification that will hopefully equip them with the knowledge and skills to enter into a very uncertain world.A world in which the forces of globalisation and economic liberalisation have fundamentally altered the jobs landscape and we need to give them the knowledge to cope in that highly uncertain, very dynamic and fast changing world, where they have to become far more entrepreneurial and creative in mapping out a future for themselves. Swartz also touched on the challenges affecting the higher education sector.LONDEKA DLAMINI
