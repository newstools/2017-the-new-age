THE Speaker of Parliament, Baleka Mbete and the chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, Thandi Modise, have expressed sadness at the death of former ANC MP and former Robben Island prisoner Laloo Chiba at the weekend. The 87-year-old Chiba, who was held in the same maximum security section of the infamous island prison as Ahmed Kathrada, Walter Sisulu and Nelson Mandela, passed away last week. The National Order of Luthuli was bestowed on Chiba in 2004. Mbete and Modise expressed their deepest condolences to Chiba’s widow Luxmi, his daughters and grandchildren and his comrades and friends. “Mr Chiba was elected as a member of Parliament in South Africa’s first non-racial democratic election in 1994 and again in our 1999 election. “This followed a life dedicated to the struggle against the apartheid government and for a non-racial, non-sexist democratic South Africa, as envisaged in our Constitution,” Parliament said yesterday. Chiba was a member of the South African Communist Party, the Transvaal Indian Congress, as well as a commander of uMkhonto we Sizwe. He was incarcerated on Robben Island for 18 years. After his release, he became a leader in the United Democratic Front, launched in Mitchell’s Plain Cape Town in August 1983. “After retiring from Parliament, Mr Chiba continued his lifelong dedication to entrenching the non-racial, non-sexist, democratic and prosperous society for which he had fought. At the time of his passing, he was also a board member of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation. “While the passing of this veteran of our struggle for democracy leaves a painful void, it must serve as a reminder to rededicate ourselves to the ideals for which our struggle stalwarts stood,” the Parliament said.
