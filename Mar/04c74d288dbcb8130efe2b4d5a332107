Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#8217;s wife set off a social media firestorm Tuesday, the eve of International Women&#8217;s Day, by suggesting that men should be celebrated too.&#8220;As we mark International Women&#8217;s Day, let&#8217;s celebrate the boys and men in our lives who encourage us to be who we truly are, who treat girls &amp; women with respect,&#8221; Sophie Gregoire Trudeau wrote on her Instagram account.She posted a photo of herself and her husband &#8212; who proudly declares himself a feminist &#8212; showing them holding hands and gazing into each other&#8217;s eyes.Gregoire Trudeau urged women to post a photo with their male ally.Joining in this way could help &#8220;create a movement that inspires more men to join the fight to build a better tomorrow with equal rights &amp; opportunities for everyone&#8230; because #EqualityMatters,&#8221; she wrote.Her post attracted plenty of blunt criticism.&#8220;I&#8217;ve never had to have my hand held,&#8221; conservative MP Michelle Rempel tweeted. &#8220;Women&#8217;s day is about women, not men!!&#8221;A woman from Vancouver added, &#8220;This is so problematic I don&#8217;t even know where to start.&#8220;International women&#8217;s day is a day to celebrate intersectional feminism and acknowledge the strides women have taken for equality while simultaneously acknowledging the active misogyny women and women identified individuals encounter on a daily basis. It is NOT a day about men.&#8221;Gregoire Trudeau seemed to take the criticism in stride, saying in a post Tuesday night, &#8220;Well, now we&#8217;re having a conversation!&#8221;&#8220;Our goal is gender equality, and fighting for it is going to require men and women working together &#8212; raising our boys and girls to make a difference, hand-in-hand. This is about recognizing that we should be allies on this journey,&#8221; she said.-AFP
