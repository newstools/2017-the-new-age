The application followed after Zuma recalled Pravin Gordhan and Mcebisi Jonas as minister of Finance and deputy minister of Finance respectively.According to reports, the recall of both Gordhan and Jonas led to the economy of South Africa being downgraded to junk status with serious economic consequences for all South Africans and especially the poor.TNA REPORTER
