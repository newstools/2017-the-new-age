Cmmunications Minister Faith Muthambi yesterday committed to strengthening South Africa s relations with Russia in information and communication technologies.Speaking during a hosting event of the Russian deputy minister of telecoms and mass communications, Alexy Volin, Muthambi stressed the importance of bilateral relations. By enhancing our shared communication efforts we will promote not only valuable trade and investment as well as skills and technologies exchange. We will champion our common developmental and political goals. This platform has been created to exchange best practices in the area of communications and media. Muthambi said Russia and South Africa needed to harness information and communication technologies. We need to tell the story of the relations between South Africa and Russia using different media platforms.We need to tell stories that will also reach the ordinary men and women in our respective countries, so that they should understand the significance of our bilateral and economic relations. It cannot be that our two governments have made major progress over these past 25 years of formal relations yet people-to-people exposure and contact remains low. We ll promote not only valuable trade and investment but also skills and technology exchange. Muthambi lauded Russia for its enduring commitment towards strengthening its ties with South Africa. We are indebted to the support that was given to South Africa by Russia against the fight and eventual triumph over the evil of apartheid. South Africa enjoys strong diplomatic relations between the two countries, established in 1992. 701198
