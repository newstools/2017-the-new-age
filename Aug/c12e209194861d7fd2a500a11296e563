A PASTOR, 35, of Tshaulu village in Vhembe who was convicted of raping his minor sister and a 16-year-old girl, was slapped with life imprisonment plus 24 years in jail, by the Limpopo High Court on Wednesday.The NPA regional spokesperson, Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi, said the court heard that the man, whose name was withheld to protect the identity of the victim, raped his 13-year-old sister on June 8, 2013. She was alone in the house when she was awoken by something falling and she heard footsteps of a person moving towards her room in the dark, Malabi-Dzangi said. A man then forcibly undressed and raped her. He left behind used condoms and a neighbour alerted the police. It only turned out two years later that the rapist was in fact her older brother, a priest who was linked to the crime through DNA results. In court, the pastor testified that his little sister offered him sex, as a bribe not to tell their parents after he saw he with a boy who seemed to be her lover.The court dismissed his testimony and slapped him with life imprisonment. In the second case, the court found out that he raped a girl who was brought to him by her grandparents for prayers on September 22, 2015. The grandparents took her to the pastor s house for prayers because she was not performing well in school. They left her there. Later in the afternoon they fetched her from the pastor s house, but on the way home, she requested to go to the clinic to obtain a sick note to present to the school the following day. At the clinic she requested to be tested for HIV as the pastor had raped her. Police were called and the pastor was later arrested, Malabi-Dzhangi said.montshom@thenewage.co.za
