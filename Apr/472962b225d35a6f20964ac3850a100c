Thanks to a diesel powertrain, BMW&#8217;s latest &#8216;M&#8217; badged 5-Series model &#8212; the M550d xDrive &#8212; is as big on power as it is on responsibility. So much so that it could help rehabilitate the fuel&#8217;s reputation.Although the company&#8217;s M&#8217; division is now spreading its wings and adding flourishes of motorsport technology or styling to a host of BMW models, rather than simply concentrating on making pure, undiluted M&#8217; variants of each production car, if a BMW comes from the factory with the M badge on its rear, it&#8217;s never a marketing gimmick.So, for the M550d xDrive to earn the right to wear the M badge, it has to offer something a bit special, regardless of what type of fuel it runs on. And here, the car doesn&#8217;t disappoint as owners will be able to claim their car has the most powerful six-cylinder diesel ever fitted to a production automobile.It has three liters of displacement, four turbochargers and 400hp. As for torque, a diesel engine&#8217;s trump card, there&#8217;s 760Nm on offer and it is accessible from 2,000rpm. It may come with an electronically restricted 250km/h (155mph) top speed, but on the way to that figure it will hit 100km/h in just 4.4 seconds. Plump for the bulkier, heavier Touring (station wagon) version and it will still manage that dash in 4.6 seconds.But M cars have to be fun in the bends as well as on the straight so the M550d xDrive comes with intelligent all-wheel drive, sharper suspension, an eight-speed sports transmission and a ride height dropped by 10mm for improved centre of gravity.Diesel may have a dirty name at the moment, but in the short term at least, the fuel&#8217;s efficiency is going to be crucial in helping truly global car companies meet tighter emissions and economy standards.It&#8217;s why Mercedes invested over 3 billion developing its latest generation ultra-efficient, lightweight OM 654 diesel powertrain that debuted in its E-Class in mid-2016. It&#8217;s also why Bentley, a company founded on very torque-y gasoline V8 engines and laterally W12 twin turbo blocks has finally started offering its most fuel-thirsty car &#8212; the Bentayga SUV &#8212; with a diesel option.The M550d xDrive has a gasoline sibling, the M550i. It has a 4.4 liter V8 calling the shots and it&#8217;s 0.4 seconds faster off the line, has 62 more horsepower but just 650Nm torque. It offers a combined fuel economy of 8.9l/100km and 204g/km in terms of CO2 emissions.The M550d returns 5.9l/100km on the combined cycle and 154g/km of CO2.-Relaxnews
