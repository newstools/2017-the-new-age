The African National Congress (ANC) has on Tuesday denied allegations that it funded an &#8216;off the books&#8217; campaign to undermine opposition parties&#8217; election campaigns to the tune of R50m.&#8220;The African National Congress has always been and remains committed to running clean campaigns in all the elections we have participated in since 1994,&#8221; ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said in a statement.&#8220;We further reject any allegation that the organisation owes any monies to any companies purporting to run such clandestine campaign,&#8221; continued Kodwa.According to reports published by amaBhungane, public relations agent Sihle Bolani has claimed in court paper that she is owed by the ANC R2.2m for work done on behalf of the ANC to influence voter sentiment during the 2016 municipal elections using social media.The amaBhungane report also identifies popular Twitter users including Shaka Sisulu as part of the ANC strategy a claim the party strongly denies.&#8220;The ANC once again reiterates that Ms Sihle Bolani, Messrs Joseph Nkadimeng and Shaka Sisulu et al were not contracted or mandated by the ANC or any of its structures tasked with the communications work of the organisation in the 2016 Local Government Election,&#8221; said Kodwa&#8220;Their activities were not sanctioned by the ANC and consequently, we distance ourselves against any insinuation that any such campaign was known to or approved by the African National Congress,&#8221; continued Kodwa.The report alleges the ANC was involved in a strategy to undermine the campaigns of opposition parties which included among others employing the services of &#8220;seemingly independent news site and chat shows, using influencers on social media, and planning to print fake opposition party posters.&#8221;On Tuesday, Sihle Bolani&#8217;s court application against the ANC to receive payment for her reported services was thrown out with costs a development which the party said vindicated it.&#8220;We welcome that we have been vindicated in this matter by the South Gauteng High Court which dismissed the application with costs today,&#8221; said Kodwa.In a online video which surfaced on Tuesday Bolani says she has opened a case of intimidation with the South African Police Service after receiving threatening phone calls.&#8220;I received a phone call yesterday from a man who said he had been contracted along with three other men to deal with me regarding this case I am taking to court,&#8221; Bolani said.Meanwhile Shaka Sisulu had promised to reveal all and &#8220;present what we know, as well as the people behind this story, at this time,&#8221; he tweeted after a Twitter explosion following the release of the news.However at the time of printing, Sisulu&#8217;s response had yet to materialise.-Sphiwe Mchunu
