Bushbuckridge-based businessman Ali Omar Molobela has urged local livestock farmers to form an association that will enable them to run their businesses effectively.Molobela, who is also a founder of a non-profit organisation known as African Dawah Movement, said it was not easy to do business with local livestock owners as they were disorganised.In an interview with The New Age yesterday Molobela said: I regularly serve as a middle man between the customers and the local livestock owners. What I have realised is that many local livestock owners run their businesses in a very unprofessional way, which makes them lose a lot of money. For example you find that they charge a very small amount compared to the normal market price. If they can come together and form an organisation, the customers will always know where to find them and it will be easy to interact with us collectively. At the moment it is difficult because we have to deal with different individual problems, of which some would have been avoided if they were operating within the organisation. Forming an association will enable them to come up with prices and business strategies that will enable them to make their businesses operate effectively, Molobela said.He said a number of Muslims and people from countries such as Ethiopia and Somalia were regular customers as they bought goats and other livestock in large quantities. The farmers he had already approached were interested in forming an association, Molobela said.However said the problem he faced while trying to mobilise the farmers was that most of them were not educated and it was not easy to convince them as far as professional conduct was concerned.When contacted for comment one of the livestock farmers Alpheus Mkhombo said: Yes, I support the idea of forming an association because we are disorganised and some customers are taking that advantage to exploit us. provinces@thenewage.co.za
