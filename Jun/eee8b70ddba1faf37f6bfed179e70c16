My message to other girls and women is that you should always empower yourself as it will always come in handy, she said.The director of the centre, Ernest Hendricks, says they do not get any funding.The only help they receive is from the mother NPO Siyafunda CTC. Other than that, other expenses are coming out of their own pockets.He also works with Shonei Naushad, who is an acting director and became aware of the initiative after the programme was advertised at her church.She says she chose to join in order to gain basic competency with a computer, which would help her when searching for a job. I now have a better understanding of what is going on around me and can be part of the corporate world. As a result of this I can give my family a better life Naushad said.She says she now feels more empowered as a person, which, in turn, made her confident and enabled her to get a job.She says that in her position at the centre her aim is to better her skills and make the work they do nationally recognised. My ultimate goal in life is to be a qualified psychologist and open an orphanage, I want to make a difference in children s lives at a young age, she said.Thandeka Simelani says learning Excel at the centre was a highlight for her, these skills she said helped her apply for a job online.Before doing the course she was unemployed and was applying for jobs that amounted to nothing but after attaching the certificate obtained from the centre to her CV she got a job immediately.Kelly Stead has a similar story and boasts that she is now computer literate and she would love to learn more about file management and Excel. She now works at MSC College in Alberton.Hendricks says that anyone from the age of 11 can join the centre and lauds Shonei Naushad who has registered a company and is now one of the beneficiaries of the biggest Ekurhuleni projects to date aptly named Vuku Phile (Wake Up and Live).Another former student he showered with praise was Marvin January who has his own sub centre in his Eden Park community.Hloni Mashigoprovinces@thenewage.co.za
