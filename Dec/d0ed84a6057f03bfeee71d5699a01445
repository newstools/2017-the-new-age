South African hip hop artist Cassper Nyovest successfully filled up the FNB Stadium on Saturday.  The rap star made history by becoming the first South African hip hop artist to ever hold a concert at the FNB Stadium with a record-breaking crowd. Taking to Twitter on the evening of the event, Nyovest announced that #FillUpFNBStadium had successfully sold 68,000 tickets, a record-breaking figure.  This successful record follows Nyovest’s two recent events that also broke records.  The ‘Mama I Made It’ hit-maker made history in 2015 by becoming the first South African artist to fill up the Dome in Johannesburg without the aid of an international act, with a crowd of 20,000.  He defied the odds again in 2016 by attempting to fill up the Orlando Stadium, which is double the capacity of the Dome. Though tickets to the event were reportedly not completely sold out, the stadium was full.  Nyovest had announced while organising #FillUpFNBStadium that the financial demands to stage the world-class production had dealt a blow to his finances to an extent that he was “broke”.  The rapper said then that he was also looking at selling his cars to try to finance the show. He initially had no sponsors, however Ciroc, SABC 1, Budweiser, Standard Bank and others later jumped on board to support his ambitious dream. Images from #FillUpFNBStadium:          -TNA Reporter
