Premier Sylvia Lucas has thrown her weight behind those condemning the brutal killings of women and children across the country.Lucas called on community members of the Northern Cape to be on the look out and know the whereabouts of their children at all times.She said it was important that community members joined hands to ensure that the safety of children and women was prioritised. Now more than ever it is important that we look at the roles family play in society. I call on the people of Olifantshoek to work hard to re-establish the family unit in society. Many social challenges in South Africa are the result of either weak family systems or altogether non-existent families, Lucas said.She said men in the society should not be regarded as enemies but rather as protectors and fathers who could help build society. The country is facing a fundamental crisis, which needs to be remedied immediately because the family is the first line of defence for our social challenges, she said.The province has also in the past experienced the case of a missing child and brutal killings.The call by the premier for communities to join hands comes after 10 months since the disappearance of five-year-old Keitumetse Magwadibane.Magwadibane disappeared on July 14, 2016 and she was last seen on her way to a shop at Promised Land near Galeshewe in Kimberley.Four people including a female sangoma were arrested and released, the case was struck from the court roll due to insufficient evidence against the suspects.The mother of the missing toddler, Margaret Magwadibane, recently made a plea for her child s return. It does not matter whether the child is dead or still alive, we just want her back, she said.Wanya Tsotsi, a crime-preventing organisation in Kimberley has also called on a more proactive, approach in dealing with crime.Leader of the organisation, Tebogo Obusitse, said recent statistics revealed by the police service was a clear picture of social ills that had gone out of control.He said they did encounter communities coming to them with complaints of house robbery and carjacking regularly. Yes we are not surprised by the crime stats, the situation in our area is bad and people are coming to us, pleading for assistance, Obusitse said.Obusitse said they wanted to strengthen the working relationship with the police service and provincial government. One of our issues is that we want to be accompanied by the police during our raids, we need their visibility, it must not only be us alone, he said.According to the police, sexual offences have gone up by 8.9% since 2014-15 from 1578 to 1719, attempted murder also rose by 17.1% from 562 to 658.Recently the South African National Civic Organisation provincial secretary Vincent Diraditsile said they would engage with relevant stakeholders to fight crime in communities. We also want to ensure that we as a civic movement provide a safe and crime free environment for our communities, he said.Diraditsile said it was important that they speeded up processes of consultation with communities and municipalities. We want to ensure that we speed up the process of establishing ward committees and prioritising to empower them with relevant training, he said.He said even though they did not have resources they would make sure that they would deal with community issues. We are going to represent and negotiate on behalf of members with other parties, organisations and authorities on any matter affecting their interest, he said.TIISETSO MANOKOtiisetsom@thenewage.co.za
