The United Democratic Movement&#8217;s application to reinstate deputy Mayor Mongameli Bobani was on Wednesday unsuccessful after the Port Elizabeth high court dismissed the party&#8217;s application .Judge Dayalin Chetty reportedly did not provide reasons for his decision, however, the UDM has been ordered to pay the costs of the respondent.Bobani was removed during a motion of no confidence in the council seating two weeks back following months of conflict within Nelson Mandela Bay metro.In a letter written by the UDM Leader Bantu Holomisa to DA leader Mr. Mmusi Maimane, Holomisa said the DA has very publicly, consciously and concertedly undermined one of its coalition partners.Referring to a draft report prepared by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), He said the DA removed Bobani under false pretences.&#8220;You had relied on an embargoed PwC draft report , which we certainly would not have seen had we not demanded a copy at a meeting of coalition partners on 22 August 2017 only two days ahead of the DA bulldozing a questionable motion of no-confidence in Cllr Bobani through Council,&#8221; he said in the letter.The report, which was given to the municipality in August this year, contained claims which appeared as the reasons behind Bobani&#8217;s axing.According to the reports PwC investigators interview at least 15 department officials and 64 litter pickers in the Bay&#8217;s waste management depots, the Herald reported.Some of the report findings since Bobani took over in August 2016, he allegedly instructed that senior official Annalisa Dyakala, who had been questioning his decisions, be removed from her position as acting director of waste management.The report says, In October Bobani allegedly handpicked another official, Nkosinathi Dolo, to replace Dyakala, despite Dolo s admission that he was not qualified for the job.&#8220;The fecklessness of the draft report forced you to keep it secret, but it did not preclude you from (ab)using it. You and your colleagues have publicly criticised me (personally) and the UDM, saying that we condone corruption,&#8221; the letter read.UDM launched a civil application against DA at the Port Elizabeth High Court in August.The application is to interdict and restrain the Nelson Mandela Bay municipality from implementing the August 24 decision to remove Deputy Executive Mayor Mongameli Bobani and reinstate him.TNA Reporter
