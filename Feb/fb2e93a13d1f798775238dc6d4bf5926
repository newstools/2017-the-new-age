What would the Metro FM Music Awards be without a bit of skin? Flashy and revealing designer outfits from some of Mzansi s much-loved celebrities and wannabes ruled supreme at the 16th annual Metro FM Music Awards at the Durban International Convention Centre on Saturday.While the usual suspects such as Bonang Matheba, Kelly Khumalo, Boity Thulo, Nomzamo Mbatha and Thando Thabethe managed to bring their A-game to the red carpet with eye-catching designs, the awards gave music lovers something to talk about with unknown singer and dancer Queen Skolopad Qwabe stealing the nude look thunder from some of the country s biggest stars.Skolopad rocked the red carpet in a daring yellow thigh-high slit dress that left her ample derriere exposed for the world to see as she opted to wear no underwear.Many on social media reacted with shock at the unknown singer who left little to the imagination as she strutted the red carpet and made sure the rolling cameras caught a glimpse of her buttocks. Needless to say, Skolopad has since been body shamed by social media users who criticised her for showing too much skin.This year s awards could be summed up as the battle of the newest record labels in the form of Mabala Noise and Ambitiouz Records as the bulk of the awards were mainly shared by artists from the two labels.Mabala Noise, owned by Reggie Nkabinde, racked up nine awards while Ambitiouz Entertainment secured four.Mabala Noise stablemate Nasty C was the night s biggest winner, taking home four awards for best hip hop, male album, new artist and the coveted song of the year. He was followed closely by Amanda Black from Ambitiouz Entertainment, who took home the best R&amp;B single and listener s choice award.The awards were also marred by technical glitches that made it difficult for some of the award presenters to read their lines from the auto cue which resulted in a frustrated Generations: The Legacy actor Vuyo Dabula abandoning his script and walking off after struggling to read it. He was not alone as eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede suffered the same fate after several awkward attempts to wing it.It was also a big night for veteran singer Kelly Khumalo who won her first ever Metro FM award. Communications Minister Faith Muthambi announced the lifetime achievement award recipients Caiphus Semenya and wife Letta Mbulu.These two winning legends had already been announced earlier during the show. After so many decades in the South African music scene it was good to see these two stalwarts being out with the young winners.Rapper Riky Rick, who won the award for best hit single, was cut short midway through his controversial acceptance speech. The Durban born rapper called the music that s being played on radio crap , saying he is not happy about his award because there are artists with no money submitting their music to radio stations but are ignored.All the winnersBest new artistNasty C: Bad Hair ExtensionsBest compilation albumDJ Qness: Essential SelectionsBest collaborationMs Pru: AmeniBest urban dance albumHenry Philemon: Man of DefinitionBest urban gospel albumDr Tumi: Love &amp; GraceBest produced albumSjava: Isina MuvaBest music videoDu Boiz: Dope DreamsBest R&amp;B singleAmanda Black: SeparateBest African pop albumMusa: Mr SeriousBest dance albumMobi Dixon: Live The MusicBest styled artist or groupMafikizoloBest female albumKelly Khumalo: My TruthBest male albumNasty C: Bad Hair ExtensionsBest kwaito singleL Vovo: Amatin TinBest hip hop albumNasty C: Bad HairBest duo/group albumDurban s Finest: ReloadedBest remixPrince Kaybee: Don t Give UpBest hit singleRiky Rick: SidlukotiniOne Africa awardVee Mampeezy: I DoListeners choice award Amanda BlackSong of the yearNasty C: Hell Naw!SIYABONGA SITHOLE and NONTOKOZO GXUMISA&nbsp;
