Tomtom has added a new addition to its range of wearables, the TomTom Touch Cardio. With this launch, TomTom not only extends its fitness tracker range but also reinforces its commitment to continue offering innovative products that inspire people to improve their health and wellbeing. The TomTom Touch is the ideal entry-level fitness tracker for those looking to ramp up their fitness routine, Chantal Grobler, TomTom country manager said. TomTom has designed the Touch Cardio to offer all the features people generally need to monitor their fitness and the attractive price point means that virtually anyone can have access to vital functions, like heart rate and sleep monitoring, Grobler said.The TomTom Touch Cardio monitors heart rate while tracking daily step counts, the number of calories burnt, sleep and active time. Heart rate monitoring is particularly useful as it adds to a more accurate calculation of calorie burn, measures the true intensity of your efforts and provides insight about your fitness level.Following the successful launch of the TomTom Touch Cardio and Body Composition fitness tracker in September last year, the first wearable on the market to offer a body composition feature, the TomTom Touch Cardio boasts an elegant new design at a more affordable price point.Wearers can download the TomTom Sports mobile app to automatically receive activity and performance data, such as steps, heart rate and calories burned, along with activity trends and comparisons, directly to their smart phones.-INDIE BOYCE|indiphileb@thenewage.coza
