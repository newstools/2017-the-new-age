African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament Makhosi Khoza has on Tuesday advised her party not to protect President Jacob Zuma.In her Facebook page Khoza said that politics of patronage has claimed the sanity of the ANC leadership and the organisation will suffer on the proposed motion of no confidence brought against Zuma. If you are a leader of society you have to listen to the diverse views of the society, no matter how painful they may sound. I think we have too as the ANC.&#8221;Khoza added that the ANC needs to listen to South Africans who took to the streets last week Friday. Whether we vote for or against, both ways the ANC loses and both ways it s going to dent significantly its status as a leader of society, Khoza said.Meanwhile, during the 24 years of Chris Hani s commemoration held on Monday President Zuma said that last week s march displayed how racism still exist in the country.-Sipho Jack
