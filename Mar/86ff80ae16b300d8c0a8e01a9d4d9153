We have been given some names of people suspected of involvement in the attack and we are on their trail.&#8221;An investigation is under way.Local media said between 30 and 50 people were killed in the attack in a region wracked by a long-running conflict between nomadic Fulani herders and local farmers over grazing rights.Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari condemned the &#8220;loss of lives&#8221; in a statement issued Tuesday.&#8220;The President condemns the wicked attack and directs security agencies to begin immediate investigation with a view to bringing the perpetrators of the dastardly act to book,&#8221; his office said.In July last year, state officials said scores of villagers were killed in Benue following weeks of clashes.
