Vivian Reddy s Radison Blu Umhlanga Oceans hotel public share scheme will give South Africans a chance to own a stake in the prestigious hotel group for as little as R1000.Brian Mpono, the project s director, says this is true radical economic transformation .Reddy s Oceans Hotel Group is building the first Radison Blu hotel in Durban s Umhlanga zone and, in an unprecedented move in the country, he is selling shares to members of the public.Today is the closing day of the first come, first served share purchase for those who had expressed interest after the launch in December and when subscription opened in January this year. Mpono said this was a game changer. This offer was for those who had expressed interest after we launched in December and further when we opened subscriptions on January 23, he said.So far, more than 40000 people have purchased shares in the hotel.Mpono said property and land ownership gave many black citizens the chance to own a share in the hotel, thereby restoring their dignity and pride. This initiative by Reddy is true radical economic transformation as the property sector is the least transformed sector in the country, Mpono said.Construction is expected to begin next month and the enterprise is to start operating in the first quarter of 2019. Three years after the hotel starts operating, investors are expected to reap dividends on an annual basis. There will be an investment lock-in period for five years and dividends will be paid on a yearly basis, Mpono said.Mpono said by lowering the minimum investment amount, ordinary South Africans can have a stake in the world s fourth-largest hotel group.However, he said, they are also looking at large investments from trusts and individual investors who want to plough millions of rands into hotel development. Reddy feels that donations to ordinary people alone are not enough to help people. Instead black people can own shares in big companies and help themselves, he said.South African citizens over the age of 18, with an ID and a bank account, can invest in the hotel.Foreign nationals residing legally in the country need a valid passport and a bank account.SIHLE MAVUSOsihlem@thenewage.co.za
