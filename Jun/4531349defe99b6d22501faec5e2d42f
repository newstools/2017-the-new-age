The National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete must not ignore the possibility that many ANC MPs could be threatened with dismissals and disciplinary hearings if they were to vote in support of the motion of confidence against President Jacob Zuma, spokesperson for the South African Communist Party (SACP) Alex Mashilo said today.Mashilo s advice come amid the Constitutional Court judgement on Thursday in which the Constitutional Court confirmed for the Speaker Baleka Mbete that she could use her discretion to allow a secret ballot on the vote of no confidence against Zuma. It is, therefore, going to be very important for the Speaker to be as comprehensive and holistic as possible in making her decision on this matter, Mashilo said.Last month, legal teams and opposition parties expressed their determination to ensure that a no-confidence motion against President Jacob Zuma was held through a secret ballot.Handing down his judgement, chief justice Mogoeng Mogoeng said: The power to decide whether a motion of no confidence is to be resolved through an open or secret ballot cannot be used illegitimately or in a manner that has no regard to the surrounding circumstances that ought to inform its exercise.&#8221;Opposition parties want MPs to vote with their conscience in the vote of no-confidence against the president, believing that that ruling party will vote against Zuma if the ballot is secret.The SACP s spokesperson asked Mbete to consider Members of Parliament who have been intimidated by the ANC when making a decision on choosing how to go about voting on the motion of no confidence against President Zuma.The ANC welcomed the chief justice Mogoeng Mogoeng s secret ballot judgment, and the way in which the court clarified how the Speaker could use her decision-making processes.Spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said the court had shown that the country s Constitution is to be regarded to be the highest law in the land, and that it has to be respected by all.He said the decision to remove president Zuma would come from the ANC, and only the ANC, and never from opposition oppositions.-Sipho Jack
