Lady Gaga debuted a R&amp;B-tinged love song Saturday as she headlined the Coachella festival, where the pop diva cast herself as sensual rather than sensational.The first woman in a decade to top the lineup at the premier music event, Lady Gaga unleashed an action-packed spectacle of acrobatic choreography that culminated in confetti, fireballs and fireworks on her dance anthem &#8220;Bad Romance.&#8221;Gaga seized upon the spotlight to introduce a new song, &#8220;The Cure,&#8221; that is built off an unadorned R&amp;B rhythm before rising into a pop chorus with the lines, &#8220;If I can&#8217;t find the cure, I&#8217;ll fix you with my love.&#8221;She released the song commercially as she left Coachella in the California desert, marking her first new music since her latest album &#8220;Joanne&#8221; came out in October.Coachella offered a preview of the global tour the pop superstar will launch in August for &#8220;Joanne,&#8221; an album that brought a more classic pop and even country sound to the 31-year-old artist long associated with synthpop.Gaga made clear at Coachella that her old spirit remained undiminished. On &#8220;John Wayne,&#8221; one of her most country-driven songs in which she admits an attraction to rugged masculinity, Gaga paradoxically sang astride a human pyramid of her sweaty, topless and ethnically diverse crew of male dancers.Sensuality oozed throughout Gaga&#8217;s set. She beckoned one dancer by grabbing his jeans in the waist, as both male and female dancers rubbed her leotard-clad body seductively.&#8220;Have you all found someone you want to sleep with yet?&#8221; she teasingly asked the 100,000-strong crowd, most of them young and many of them clad only in the bare minimum of clothing after a long day in the sun.Yet for a singer once talked about as much for her outrageous outfits as her songs, she stepped back and put the emphasis on her music &#8212; giving herself space to show off her glowing, rich voice on tracks such as &#8220;The Edge of Glory.&#8221;Her biggest fashion message may have come as she played piano. She struggled to take off her sweater mid-song, in an endearing display of authenticity.&#8211; Surprise guests &#8211;Lady Gaga played her first Coachella after original headliner Beyonce canceled on doctors&#8217; orders as she expects twins.One of the most lucrative events on the global cultural calendar, Coachella takes place over back-to-back three-day weekends with identical lineups.In a Coachella hallmark, Saturday saw a slew of surprise performers &#8212; delighting fans who avidly posted to social media.The rapper Future, who recently made history with back-to-back albums debuting at number one on the US chart, drew cheers when he brought to stage Migos, the Atlanta trio behind the hit &#8220;Bad and Boujee.&#8221;But an even bigger name soon came on &#8212; rap superstar Drake, a sometime collaborator with Future, who turned the crowd into a sea of waving arms as he performed his hit &#8220;Fake Love.&#8221;Migos then crossed the lawn to make a cameo with DJ Snake, the successful but largely behind-the-scenes force behind mega-hits such as &#8220;Lean On.&#8221;The French DJ pulled off a second surprise as Lauryn Hill walked on, singing the Fugees emblematic song &#8220;Killing Me Softly.&#8221;&#8211; Non-Gaga fashion &#8211;Bon Iver, once a crowd favorite with indie folk tunes such as &#8220;Skinny Love,&#8221; brought to stage the band&#8217;s turn into deep experimentation in a set of loop effects and references to numerological riddles from its latest album, &#8220;22, A Million.&#8221;Frontman Justin Vernon performed in headphones at a soundboard but by the end of the set brought the crowd into a frenzy as he knelt before his sound pedals and clamped aggressively onto his electric guitar&#8217;s bridge as abstract images flashed on screen.While Lady Gaga toned down her outfits, one artist who embraced costumes was Roisin Murphy. The Irish trip-hop singer took the stage with her face covered by a mask made of interjoined dolls and later carried over her head a faceless, zebra-colored dummy.If Coachella handed out fashion awards, one could also go to frontman Will Toledo of Car Seat Headrest, the prolific indie rockers with a unique talent to work songs down to quiet and back up to intensity.The 24-year-old Toledo, long pictured as a scraggly younger, donned a tight, sky-blue suit with a black shirt and necktie.-AFP
