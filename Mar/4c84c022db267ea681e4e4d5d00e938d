Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli was banned for three European club matches by UEFA on Friday for his sending off against Gent last month.Alli received a straight red card in the 2-2 draw at Wembley for his horror tackle on Gent&#8217;s Brecht Dejaegere, which saw the Premier League club knocked out of the Europa League with a 3-2 aggregate loss.The 20-year-old speared his right foot high into Dejaegere&#8217;s shin. The Belgian midfielder was able to continue but had to be later substituted, limping off with a bloodied shin.&#8221;Tottenham Hotspur FC player Dele Alli has been suspended for three (3) UEFA competition matches for which he would otherwise be eligible,&#8221; a UEFA statement read.&#8220;The charges related to a red card given to Dele Alli during the match.&#8221;The 20-year-old will miss the first three games of next season&#8217;s Champions League if Spurs qualify for the tournament again.Alli&#8217;s absence will come as a huge blow to Spurs, who flopped in this season&#8217;s Champions League in the group stages, before losing to Gent in the last 32 of the Europa League.They are on course to qualify for Europe&#8217;s premier tournament again, sitting second in the Premier League table, but their chances of reaching the knock-out stages will be hampered without Alli.The midfielder admitted he felt &#8220;horrible&#8221; following his challenge on Dejaegere.It was Alli&#8217;s first straight red card of his career but he received a retrospective three-match ban at the end of last season for punching West Brom&#8217;s Claudio Yacob in the stomach.-AFP
