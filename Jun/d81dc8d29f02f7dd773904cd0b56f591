Romania&#8217;s ruling leftists filed a no-confidence motion in parliament on Sunday against their prime minister, Sorin Grindeanu, escalating a conflict which government critics say reflects internal rifts over anti-corruption policy.The Social Democrat Party (PSD) and its coalition allies withdrew their support for Grindeanu, 43, last Wednesday, saying he has failed to implement the PSD&#8217;s broad governing agenda since it won a parliamentary election last December.Grindeanu refused to resign and was expelled from the party.Independent observers said the PSD is likely unhappy with Grindeanu&#8217;s failure to relax Romania&#8217;s anti-corruption rules earlier this year and wanted to oust him to ensure a different premier does more to protect party seniors facing graft charges.Romania is seen as one of the European Union&#8217;s most corrupt states and Brussels has kept its justice system under special monitoring since its 2007 entry.&#8220;Grindeanu&#8217;s removal seems to be at the forefront of an effort by the ruling coalition to relaunch a drive to weaken the anti-corruption fight,&#8221; said commentator Mircea Marian.At stake could be the future of PSD leader Liviu Dragnea, who has received a two-year suspended sentence in a vote-rigging case and is now on trial in a separate abuse of office case.After a recent constitutional court ruling, the government has to propose a cap on financial damages caused by abuse of office offences, a level which could be decisive in Dragnea&#8217;s case.&#8220;This threshold is among reasons why Grindeanu had to be removed,&#8221; said political analyst Cristian Patrasconiu.A push this year by Grindeanu&#8217;s government to decriminalise several corruption offences triggered the biggest street protests in Romania since the collapse of Nicolae Ceausescu&#8217;s communist rule in 1989.The government was forced to rescind the decree, and its architect, Justice Minister Florin Iordache resigned, citing a need to appease public opinion but saying he had done nothing wrong.&#8220;Clearly Grindeanu is perceived by PSD leaders as lacking a firm hand,&#8221; said Marian. &#8220;So they are looking for a prime minister tough enough to handle and defuse any potential street protests (in the future).&#8221;The PSD and its junior coalition ally have enough deputies for the no-confidence motion to succeed, when it is put to a vote on Wednesday.Neither grouping has said anything about their plans regarding anti-corruption policy, but both reject accusations they want to relax the rules for political gain.&#8220;This is a vote against a pseudo-government, one without any legitimacy. A government which believes it can exert power in its own name,&#8221; Social Democrat senator Mihai Fifor told parliament on Sunday.-Reuters
