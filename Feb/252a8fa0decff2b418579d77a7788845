Authorities have yet to comment on the cause of death.&#8220;The rugby world is in shock today after news of the tragic passing of Dan Vickerman,&#8221; ARU chief executive Bill Pulver said.&#8220;Dan was an uncompromising competitor who forged a wonderful international rugby career despite a number of injury setbacks along the way.&#8220;He was an enforcer on the field and a much-loved character off the field. He cared deeply about the game and the players, helping players transition into life after rugby in his role with (the players association) RUPA following his retirement.&#8220;Our thoughts and prayers are with Dan&#8217;s family at this extremely difficult time.&#8221;Vickerman&#8217;s death has rocked the rugby world.
