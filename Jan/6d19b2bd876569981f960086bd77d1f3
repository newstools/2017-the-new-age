Ford South Africa is likely to lose a fortune on new car sales if the saga over the Ford Kuga continues.Several Kugas have caught fire this year, painting a poor picture of its image that will drive customers away. Experts calculated an estimated R150bn in losses, while at least 4 500 cars have been recalled.The National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of SA is expected to release January sales figures next month and industry players say Ford is unlikely to keep up with the momentum of 281 units sold for 1.5 and 2.0/l engine Kugas sold during the same period last year.Although the 1.6 Kuga models were manufactured between February 2013 to September 2015, with 6 334 sold, a number of brand managers argued that the poor picture already painted is likely to make customers shy away from the brand despite the fact that the last unit of 1.6/l was sold in September 2015. No 1.6/l models were produced last year as it was replaced by the 1.5/l Eco boost model, but brand experts pointed out that what is at risk for Ford, especially Kugas, is its brand equity, such as customer loyalty and positive brand recognition. If the brands lose customer loyalty, it will hurt sales. According to Lightstone Consumer, which provides data on property, automotive and business assets, about 281 new Kugas were sold in January last year. Entry level models sold at R383 900 and the luxury version at R543 900.If no Kugas was sold for the whole of January, the company s growth will drop significantly by R107bn if one assumes similar numbers. Last October, the company enjoyed a bumper sales month, achieving not only its highest-ever market share in South Africa, but also recording significant gains in year-on-year share and overall sales volumes.Ford notched up its best-ever market share of 16.4% in October, driven by its continued growth in passenger and light commercial vehicle segments, but the latest scandal on their Kugas is likely to drag down its performance.Carolyn Thompson at Mutual &amp; Federal, said although Ford will be the right player to comment on this matter, the reality is that unwelcome implication for Ford Kuga owners is that the value of these cars is likely to have dropped significantly, due to the recall.business@thenewage.co.za
