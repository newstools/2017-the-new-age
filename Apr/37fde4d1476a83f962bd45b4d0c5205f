Ayanda Mabulu&#8217;s latest painting is grotesque, inflammatory and of bad taste, according to the African National Congress (ANC).&#8220;Whilst we respect Mabulu&#8217;s freedom of expression&#8230;No matter what message he may want to send to President Zuma and the African National Congress, we view his work as crossing the bounds of rationality to degradation, exploiting the craft of creative art for nefarious ends.&#8220;More concerning is his callous abuse of our icon, the late founding president of democratic South Africa,&#8221; said the ANC&#8217;s Khusela Sangoni.The always controversial Mabulu&#8217;s latest painting features President Jacob Zuma performing a sexual act on late former President Nelson Mandela.&#8220;Such vulgarity and disdain for the dignity of others is crude, demeaning, derogatory and markedly makes the point that no freedoms, including the freedom of expression, are unlimited.&#8220;Accordingly, the ANC reserves its right to seek recourse through the criminal justice system as well as the institutions set up to promote and protect the fundamental human rights of all in South Africa,&#8221; said Sangoni.The ANC has called on its members and South Africans to ignore Mabulu&#8217;s latest painting and not infringe on his rights to freedom of expression.Many have taken to social media to voice out their opinions about the painting.Such disrespect to Tata&#8217;s legacy People hate Zuma bt he is still the pres n an elder.

Last year he irked the ANC and many South Africans with a painting depicting President Jacob Zuma engaged in a sexual act with a member of the Gupta family.-TNA Reporter
