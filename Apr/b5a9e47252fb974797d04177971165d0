Swansea City are confident they can avoid relegation after ending their six-game winless streak against Stoke City last weekend, manager Paul Clement said on Thursday.With four league games to play, the Welsh side are currently placed 18th and two points adrift of safety ahead of Sunday&#8217;s trip to fifth-placed Manchester United.&#8220;The players showed against Stoke that they can perform even when the anxiety and pressure is high,&#8221; Clement told a news conference.&#8220;We have four games to go, two away and two at home. The players are confident and I am confident that we can go and pick up valuable points in all of them.&#8221;Clement said winger Wayne Routledge could still play a role this season after undergoing a hernia operation this week. Defender Martin Olsson and midfielder Leroy Fer are also expected to be involved in training ahead of weekend&#8217;s clash at Old Trafford.&#8220;Routledge had his hernia operation on Tuesday and should be with us shortly. He could play again this season,&#8221; said Clement.&#8220;Olsson has made good progress and should return to team training tomorrow. Fer had a dead leg but will rejoin us tomorrow.&#8221;Swansea visit Mourinho&#8217;s United side who are unbeaten in 23 league games and are heading into a derby encounter at Manchester City later on Thursday.-Reuters
