The South African Anxiety and Depression Group (Sadag) said it would partner with local celebrities to create awareness of mental health and fight against the stigma surrounding mental health.This month marks Mental Health Awareness Month.Statistics show that one in three people will suffer from mental illness in their lifetime while 23 people commit suicide every day.Sadag said it would share 31 mental health facts as part of its Did You Know campaign to educate South Africans on mental health.The organisation called for an open and honest conversation on mental health and also called on people to use its social media platforms to connect with experts in mental health. Society tends to believe that a person with a mental health condition is crazy, out of control or incapable. Too often, people don t try to get help out of fear of how others will react when they find out. Sadag is advocating for change to show that mental illness is nothing shameful and getting help is possible, Sadag said.A lack of budget, resources, facilities, psychiatrists and psychologists has been highlighted as adding to the woes of mental healthcare users.The lack of resources for mental health has been labelled as a violation of human rights.It is estimated that for every 100000 people there are 0.24 psychiatrists to treat them and 0.34 psychologists.Lack of data on the prevalence of mental health has also been pointed out as another challenge.Mental health has come under sharp focus since the Life Esidimeni tragedy in which more than 100 psychiatric patients died after they were moved from the facilities into illegal NGOs across the province.Health ombudsman professor Malegapuru Makgoba found in his damning report that the decision by the Gauteng health department under the Mental Health Marathon Project to relocate the patients was flawed and negligent.Malegapuru found that the patients died of starvation and dehydration among others.Various events are expected to be held across the country during the mental health awareness month.LERATO DIALEleratod@thenewage.co.za
