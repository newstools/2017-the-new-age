South Africa s economy is performing below expectations and this trend is likely to continue, with 2017 growth projected at less than 1%.This weak economic growth is projected to continue for the rest of the year before picking up moderately in 2018, as private consumption (and exports) is expected to rise on the back of a recovery in commodity prices and growth in export markets.How did we get here? Most experts blame what they call President Jacob Zuma s persistent political debacles said to be causing collateral damage to the economy. Specifically, ANC internal divisions and policy uncertainty have been cited as the more damaging effects of the Zuma presidency.According to Judith February, who is based at the Institute for Security Studies, Zuma cannot speak with any legitimacy or credibility on the economy since he has single-handedly done more to undermine and destroy the economy than any post-apartheid president .Zuma himself, she says, is a major stumbling block to a growing, healthy economy, and, contrary to popular belief February says it is actually the president who is a stumbling block to economic transformation and the redressing of the structural economic injustices of the past .Judith February is, of course, echoing views of many of the so-called economic experts who have gone over the edge to align their expertise with their deep-seated sentiments on the political and economic dynamics of the country.When you follow their arguments, in order to find causality, in order to determine the specific actions that Zuma has taken or not taken, and their direct impact on the economy, these arguments begin to follow an infinite regress.The departure point for any conversation on the economy has to be what are South Africa s drivers of economic growth and how have these been compromised or made ineffective by Zuma s persistent political debacles.Real investors in South Africa, particularly in mining, will tell you that many investors are actually more fearful of China s slowdown as the planet s main driver of growth.China s economy is still growing at higher percentages but what sparks the markets is anticipation than actuality and anticipation is that China s growth is not going to continue at higher rates.The result is the markets are adjusting to this reality before it even happens, causing it to happen sooner, a self-fulfilling prophecy.China s slowdown has huge implications for most markets, particular suppliers of commodities which ties in with RSA s slow economic growth. RSA remains largely dependent on commodities as its driver of economic growth due to export markets.Our mining industry accounts for more than 50% of the country s exports. Reliance on mining for exports, along with the slowdown of export demand for commodities, has resulted in the steady decline in the value of the rand.As a result, the economy heavily depends on global recovery of demand something that has implications on the prices of commodities.SA s top 10 companies account for 70% of its 40 Index and mining companies dominate the list, which heavily affects both the health of our international and local markets.In 2016, Stats SA found that the country s GDP slowed to 0.3%, with the biggest contractions occurring in industries like mining, manufacturing and quarrying.Despite the nation s reputation as a tech haven, some 57% of South Africa s economy is still composed of commodities, which as we have said, has been hard hit by declining worldwide demand over the past several years.In fact, the frail export market has led to a significant decrease in the value of the rand, causing it to drop to an all-time low of R18 per dollar in 2016.Yet another sector that has seen more than its share of difficulties is agriculture, long famous for its wines and more recently, its olive oil. This sector was once heralded as a potential saviour, with the promise of nearly one million jobs which, unfortunately, turned out to be overblown as employers use seasonal workers and face uncertainty because a huge amount of their income depends on global demand. To make things worse, South African farmers are also facing the worst drought in more than a century, which forced the agricultural sector to shrink by nearly 14%.Coupled with inflationary pressures and poor farm output, food costs are rising by as much as 6.2%, resulting in a grim overall outlook for the nation seconomy.It s difficult to see how all these mining and agricultural economic debacles can be linked to Zuma s so-called persistent political collateral damage.Growing export revenues is a necessary condition for sustainable growth in South Africa.The surge in domestic spending between 2004 and 2007 was only possible because there was a commodities boom.Since 2012, declining export revenues have taken their toll. A rising current account deficit has weakened the rand, eroding real personal incomes.Mining investment has contracted. The machine driving growth has switched off.This witch-hunt for who is responsible for our economic woes has seen people blaming the Zuma government for everything, from fiscal discipline, salaries of government employees, infrastructure backlog, inadequate education system and poisonous labour relations, all just to avoid facing the reality that we have an export market (and local economy) that is heavily depended on commodities and that global demand has been slowing down over the years, dragging our economy with it.We don t dare talk about private sector investment boycott in the economy, for some all the blame must reside with the government in bad times, in the good times, it s the private sector that is responsible for growth and boom.It s the same thing that is happening to oil- producing and dependent countries, who have seen their revenues more than halved over the past few years, as global demand for oil has dropped drastically.The problem, of course, with our country s experts is that they are but private individuals with private interests instead of being solution-driven experts who help the country find real solutions.Mfundo Bongela is the regional secretary of the ANC s Joe Gqabi region in the Eastern Cape Instead of blaming Zuma, look at reality of export trade NDP s cosmetic reforms only look to deracialise monopoly ownership, instead of transforming the structure of nation s economy The recent poverty and unemployment statistics validates Cosatu s long-held contention that the National Development Plan (NDP) in its current form cannot provide solutions to the country s triple crisis of unemployment, poverty and inequality.South Africa is struggling with a real unemployment rate of 38%, with close to 10 million people struggling to get jobs and 17 million people on welfare. The recent data by the Statistics South Africa report shows that out of a population of 56 million, around 13.8 million people are now living below the food poverty line of R17.38 a person a day. It also shows that more than 30 million people out of 56 million are impoverished.Since the adoption of the NDP by the ANC-led government in 2013, the fifth administration as led by the ANC continues to preside over economic contraction and job losses, despite that the mandate from the ANC s 53rd Mangaung conference was for urgency and determination in pursuance of the radical second phase of the nation s transition.Five years ago, when the NDP was adopted by government, Cosatu argued that there was a need to review the economic and labour chapters of the NDP because they were punting the failed neo-liberal economic trajectory and also pushing for labour flexibility and weakening of labour laws.The NDP was presented as a framework that lays the foundation for long-term planning for this radical socio-economic agenda over the next 20 years , with the aim of eradicating poverty, increasing employment and reducing inequality by 2030.In its 2014 manifesto the ANC stated that the National Infrastructure Plan and Industrial Policy Action Plan would continue to drive the government s policy agenda .However, the advent of the NDP meant an end to the attempt to forge an alignment of the macroeconomic policies, in particular the monetary policy, with the industrial policy and job creation as proposed in the NGP.Basically, with its chapters on macroeconomic and labour market policies, the NDP meant a return to the same old conservative policies inherited from Gear. Hence, this provoked rejection and a critique from Cosatu.It is clear now that the engagements that took place on these matters within the alliance were nothing but a way to manage objections by alliance partners, as they have yielded no results.The Treasury continues with its restrictive fiscal policy which is obsessively focused on achieving the target of a 3% budget deficit and the Reserve Bank continues to pursue its inflation target of 3-6%, thus excessively restricting the economy to a low-growth path.Current economic trends have unleashed very harsh conditions, especially for the working class and the poor, on top of the already severe triplecrises of unemployment, poverty and inequality. Nearly half a million people lost their jobs last year and we have already lost 120000 jobs this year.According to Statistics South Africa, of the 546000 people who have just joined the ranks of the unemployed, approximately 58% were young people aged 15-34. This means that in terms of the expanded definition, we actually face a crisis of 70% youth unemployment.As workers, we continue to argue that the NDP does not represent a necessary radical economic shift that will help the country towards a new growth trajectory. It has become obvious now that the NDP has not only failed to advance a radical economic shift, but is actually threatening to reverse certain progressive advances that have been made by the ANC and government.South Africa s unemployment rate is at its highest level since 2003, according to Statistics SA. The NDP contradicts, or fails to take forward, key progressive policies that have already been adopted by government in order to help us create large numbers of decent, sustainable jobs.The Mangaung conference resolved that the New Growth Path (NGP) would be the defining framework for the medium-term policy imperatives. It went further to say that the industrial policy action plan would guide reindustrialisation and decent work would be the primary focus of economic policy.Furthermore, it said that the state mining company would be strengthened to capture a share of mineral resource rents and equity; and more importantly from our point view as a federation of workers, Mangaung resolved that critical services such as cleaning services, security services, food services and laundry services and linen supply must be provided in-house and not be out-sourced .Unlike the NDP, the NGP placed emphasis on the creation of decent jobs and reduction of inequalities rather than narrowly focusing on a growth target. The NDP has a one-sided focus on economic growth. There is consensus within the alliance that economic growth is not the panacea to all of our problems, but rather there is a need for a new growth trajectory, which addresses rather than reproduces our triple crises of unemployment, poverty and inequality.However the primary focus of the NDP is on economic growth and the rate of growth, not on its composition, or the role of redistribution in determining the impact of growth. It contradicts the NGP and a range of ANC economic policy resolutions on this, including the economic transformation commission resolution from Mangaung which states structural problems require structural solution that transform the trajectory of economic growth, reindustrialise the South African economy and accelerate social development .The NDP proposes cosmetic reforms to the economic structure, aimed at best to deracialise ownership, rather than transform the structure of the economy.Monopolies are only seen as a problem to the extent that they distort the market and block black ownership.Despite its massive emphasis on raising the competitiveness of the economy, amazingly the entire NDP makes very little reference to competition policy and only references to the competition commission under health.The plan focuses all its proposals for greater competition in areas where state owned enterprise operate for example on infrastructure, which has numerous proposals to increase competition. In other words its focus is on introducing private sector competition where there is state ownership and has a blind spot when it comes to acting against monopoly ownership and control in the private sector.The NDP s solution to problems of concentrated ownership lies in economic growth and new opportunities, which will ultimately see the deracialisation of the economy.It goes on to say a rapidly growing economy that is diversifying into new sectors will open up opportunities for black-owned firms and smaller businesses, promoting inclusive growth . This is the faith in market forces at its best and is not different to the DA s equal opportunities dogma.The recently released government s Inclusive Growth Action Plan as presented by the national Treasury is dogmatically following in the prescripts of the NDP because it is nothing but the reintroduction of trickle-down neo-economics that says the private sector knows best and that the state must play a lesser role in the economy and at worst not be involved at all.Cosatu argues that we can expect nothing from a plan that does not even attempt to fundamentally transform the structure of our economy and promote a new growth path that will help us to industrialise our economy.Nothing will be achieved with a plan that does not place the creation of decent work for all, at the centre of economic policy and also fails to place redistribution and combating of economic inequality and poverty as fundamental pillars of economic development.Instead the NDP s jobs plan is problematic and unsustainable, based on creating low quality precarious jobs outside the core productive sectors of the economy.Cosatu remains fully in support of a planned economy and a strong interventionist state and will continue to reject the overreliance on the market economy This view has been powerfully validated and reinforced by the latest statistics that show that since the adoption of the NDP by the fifth administration, we are going backwards instead of going forward in addressing the socio-economic challenges facing the country.The current economic crisis is as a direct result of unregulated capitalism being allowed to dictate economic strategies, with disastrous consequences for the majority of the country s population, the workers and the poor.The NDP is failing the majority and its proponents and hard-line supporters are guilty of selling out.Sidumo Dlamini is president of Cosatu
