Rap mogul Diddy has been sued by a personal chef who says she worked long hours without extra pay and was made uneasy by serving meals after sex parties.Cindy Rueda sought an unspecified amount in damages for allegations &#8212; denied by Diddy &#8212; that include sexual harassment and failure to pay overtime wages.Rueda said she sometimes worked from 9 am to 2 am as she cooked at the Los Angeles home of Diddy, whose real name is Sean Combs and was formerly known as Puff Daddy.The lawsuit filed Monday in a Los Angeles court said the rapper would ask Rueda &#8220;to prepare and serve entrees and appetizers to him and his guests while Mr. Combs and his guests were engaged in or immediately following sexual activity.&#8221;The lawsuit said she at least once &#8220;was summoned by Mr. Combs to serve him a post-coital meal&#8221; in which he made suggestive remarks.On at least one other occasion, she said a naked male visitor entered the kitchen as she cooked and asked her &#8220;to look at and admire his genitals after he had engaged in sexual activity with another house guest.&#8221;A representative for Diddy dismissed the accusations, saying: &#8220;This is a frivolous lawsuit by a disgruntled ex-employee who was fired for cause.&#8221;Rueda said she was fired last year after being accused of theft. She said she had taken a watch which Diddy&#8217;s housekeeper said was found in the garbage and that she was given a chance to keep it if she renounced her complaints.Rueda said she earned $150 a day even if she worked late or traveled with Diddy. She said she was offered a full-time job in June 2015 but declined due to &#8220;unreasonable hours and pay.&#8221;After a string of successful albums starting in the 1990s, Diddy has become a successful entrepreneur in fashion and beverages, with Forbes magazine putting the 47-year-old&#8217;s net worth at $750 million.In 2003, he ordered better conditions for workers in Honduras after activists found sweatshop conditions in the production of his Sean John clothing line.-AFP
