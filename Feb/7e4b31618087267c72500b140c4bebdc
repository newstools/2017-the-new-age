New Zealand media Monday accused Ali Williams of tarnishing the image of the All Blacks after French police charged the World Cup-winning former international with buying cocaine.Williams and ex-Wallaby James O&#8217;Connor were arrested outside a Paris nightspot over the weekend after allegedly being caught with 2.4 grams (0.08 ounces) of the drug.Fairfax New Zealand sports columnist Kevin Norquay said such behaviour was unacceptable for a former All Black, let alone one who once led the team&#8217;s fabled haka war dance.&#8220;Ali Williams has hauled the proud black name through the white powder dirt,&#8221; he wrote.&#8220;He&#8217;s not just a silly boy with money having a bit of a lark outside a Paris nightclub.&#8220;He&#8217;s Ali Williams, All Black lock, 77 Test caps, World Cup winner in 2011. Wearer of the Silver Fern, dispenser of the haka.&#8221;Norquay said Williams&#8217; status as an All Black was the reason he was in France playing for Racing 92, the defending Top 14 champions who have suspended the 35-year-old indefinitely over the incident.&#8220;Williams&#8217; allegedly illegal act did not hurt only himself, or those close to him &#8212; such as his wife and small children. He harmed the All Black legacy,&#8221; he added.Williams is the second ex-All Black at Racing 92 to face trouble with the law after the legendary Dan Carter was caught drink-driving in Paris earlier this month.Newstalk ZB&#8217;s France correspondent Catherine Field said Racing 92 promoted itself as a family club and would have expected better from its high-profile recruits.&#8220;It&#8217;s not just a glamour club, it&#8217;s a club that&#8217;s really based around family&#8230; it&#8217;s really something that goes against the ethics of this particular club,&#8221; she said.&#8220;On top of that, there&#8217;s always a lot of interest in what the former All Blacks are doing here in France.&#8221;However, there was also some sympathy for Williams, with the New Zealand Herald&#8217;s Chris Rattue saying the lock was a &#8220;victim&#8221; in the war on drugs.&#8220;I wish Williams and O&#8217;Connor well,&#8221; he wrote, arguing that prohibition of drugs had created a disaster.&#8220;Theirs was a victim-less crime.&#8221;He added the pair were &#8220;guilty of nothing, whatever the outcome&#8221;.Williams made his All Blacks debut in 2002 and played 77 Tests over the next decade, including victory in the 2011 World Cup final against France.He gained a reputation as a prankster during his playing days, once turning up to a Super Rugby press conference dressed as Spiderman.There were also off-field issues and the Auckland Blues sent him home in disgrace ahead of a semi-final in South Africa in 2007 for repeated indiscretions.-AFP
