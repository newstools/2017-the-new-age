When the spark went out of Masayuki Ozaki&#8217;s marriage, he found an unusual outlet to plug the romantic void,a silicone sex doll he swears is the love of his life.The life-size dummy, called Mayu, shares his bed under the same roof as Ozaki&#8217;s wife and teenage daughter in Tokyo, an arrangement that triggered angry rows before a delicate truce was finally declared.&#8221;After my wife gave birth we stopped having sex and I felt a deep sense of loneliness,&#8221; the 45-year-old physiotherapist told AFP in an interview.&nbsp;&#8220;But the moment I saw Mayu in the showroom, it was love at first sight,&#8221; blushed Ozaki, who takes his doll on dates in a wheelchair and dresses her in wigs, sexy clothes and jewellery. &#8220;My wife was furious when I first brought Mayu home. These days she puts up with it, reluctantly,&#8221; he added.&#8221;When my daughter realised it wasn&#8217;t a giant Barbie doll, she freaked out and said it was gross,but now she&#8217;s old enough to share Mayu&#8217;s clothes.&#8221; Ozaki is one of an increasing number of Japanese men turning to rubber romance in a country that&#8217;s lost its mojo.&nbsp;He also admits to being turned off by human relationships.&#8221;Japanese women are cold-hearted,&#8221; he said while on a seaside stroll with his silicone squeeze.&#8221;They&#8217;re very selfish. Men want someone to listen to them without grumbling when they get home from work,&#8221; Ozaki added.&#8221;Whatever problems I have, Mayu is always there waiting for me. I love her to bits and want to be with her forever.&nbsp;&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine going back to a human being. I want to be buried with her and take her to heaven.&#8221; Removable head Around 2,000 of the life-like dolls, which cost from $6,000 and come with adjustable fingers, removable head and genitals, are sold each year in Japan, according to industry insiders.&#8221;Technology has come a long way since those nasty inflatable dolls in the 1970s,&#8221; noted Hideo Tsuchiya, managing director of doll maker Orient Industry.&nbsp;&#8220;They look incredibly real now and it feels like you&#8217;re touching human skin. More men are buying them because they feel they can actually communicate with the dolls,&#8221; he explained. Popular with disabled customers and widowers, as well as mannequin fetishists, some men use dolls to avoid heartache.&#8221;Human beings are so demanding,&#8221; insisted 62-year-old Senji Nakajima, who tenderly bathes his rubber girlfriend Saori, has framed photos of her on his wall and even takes her skiing and surfing.&nbsp;&#8220;People always want something from you,like money or commitment,&#8221; he complained. &#8220;My heart flutters when I come home to Saori,&#8221; added the married father-of-two as he picnicked with his plastic partner.&#8221;She never betrays me, she makes my worries melt away.&#8221; Nakajima&#8217;s relationship with Saori has divided his family, but the Tokyo-born businessman refuses to give her up.&nbsp;&#8220;My son accepts it, my daughter can&#8217;t,&#8221; said Nakajima, whose wife has banned Saori from the family home.&#8221;I&#8217;ll never date a real woman again &#8212; they&#8217;re heartless,&#8221; he insisted back at his cluttered Tokyo apartment, sandwiched between two dolls from previous dalliances and a headless rubber torso.Reconciliation with his estranged wife is unlikely, admits Nakajima. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be able to take a bath with Saori, or snuggle up with her and watch TV,&#8221; he said, slipping the doll into some racy purple lingerie.&#8221;I don&#8217;t want to destroy what I have with her.&#8221;&nbsp; &#8216;To me, she&#8217;s human&#8217; While the pillow talk is decidedly one-way, Nakajima believes he has discovered true love, saying: &#8220;I&#8217;d never cheat on her, even with a prostitute, because to me she&#8217;s human.&#8221; As Japan struggles with a plummeting birthrate, a growing number of men, known as &#8216;herbivores&#8217; &#8212; are turning their backs on love and traditional masculine values for a quiet, uncompetitive life.&nbsp;&#8220;In the future I think more and more guys will choose relationships with dolls,&#8221; said Yoshitaka Hyodo, whose home is an Aladdin&#8217;s Cave of dolls, kitsch toys and Japanese erotica. &#8220;It&#8217;s less stress and they complain a lot less than women,&#8221; he added. Hyodo, a military buff who lives alone but has an understanding girlfriend, owns more than 10 life-size dummies &#8212; many of which he dresses in combat uniform to play out wartime fantasies. But he claims to have cut down on doll sex.&nbsp;&#8220;It&#8217;s more about connecting on an emotional level for me now,&#8221; said the 43-year-old blogger, whose curiosity was piqued at a young age when he found a charred mannequin in the street. &#8220;People might think I&#8217;m weird, but it&#8217;s no different than collecting sports cars. I don&#8217;t know how much I&#8217;ve spent but it&#8217;s cheaper than a Lamborghini,&#8221; he said. Future doll users can expect more bang for their buck as researchers work to develop next-generation sexbots able to talk, laugh and even simulate an orgasm.But for now, Ozaki&#8217;s long-suffering wife Riho tries hard to ignore the rubber temptress silently taunting her from her husband&#8217;s bedroom.&#8221;I just get on with the housework,&#8221; she sniffed. &#8220;I make the dinner, I clean, I do the washing. I choose sleep over sex.&#8221;-AFP
