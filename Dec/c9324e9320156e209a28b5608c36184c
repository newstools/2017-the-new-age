Baroka FC have returned to their winning ways after defeating SuperSport United 3-1 in an Absa Premiership clash at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Sunday afternoon. However, the home side struggled to settled into the game, allowing SuperSport to dictate the match. Despite their dominance, SuperSport were let down by their final touches. The home side broke the deadlock in the 31st minute through Lucky Nguzana. Eric Tinkler’s charges had to chase the game but were unlucky to find the equaliser before going to halftime. The Tshwane-based outfit came from the halftime break guns blazing, putting Baroka under immense pressure. Eight minutes into the second half, Azubuike Egwuekwe leveled matters when he headed home Thuso Phala’s corner-kick to make it 1-1. SuperSport’s joy was short lived when Letladi Madubanya restored Baroka’s lead in the 72nd minute. The home side scored a third goal in the stoppage time after some great footwork by Talent Chawapiwa before setting up Mduduzi Mdatsane who made no mistake from a close range. Baroka are sitting on  eighth spot in the league log with 19 points from 14 games. On the other side, SuperSport continue to struggle to win their catch-up games as they occupy position 11 in the league table with 15 points. Matsatsa a Pitoria will return to action when they face wounded Bloemfontein Celtic on Wednesday at Dr Molemela Stadium. Celtic will be coming to this encounter looking to end the year with a win after they were hammered 4-1 by Mamelodi Sundowns on Saturday at Loftus Stadium in Pretoria. -TNA Reporter
