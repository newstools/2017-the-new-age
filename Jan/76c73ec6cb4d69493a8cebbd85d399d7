Musical theatre lovers are in for a treat as Joburg Theatre presents the ultimate masterpiece in American musicals, West Side Story, until March 5. The show which premiered on Tuesday night, is based on Shakespeare s Romeo and Juliet and is about a turf war between two inner-city gangs, the Sharks and the Jets.Conceptualised by Jerome Robbins, it is set in the Upper West Side neighborhood in New York City in the mid-1950s. The musical is infused with vitality, gritty realism and spectacular stagecraft. Its themes of love, tragedy, racism, immigration and gang rivalry are enduring.The local crew is involved in many aspects of the production from set, lighting, sound and costume design to choreography, music and stage performance. This is a timeless piece and my interest in being in the production came purely from wanting to find a new way to tell this story, Matthew Wild, the director of the show, said. The show is complicated, technically speaking. There are very few theatres that we can take this show to because it uses every piece of stage machinery built into it. The team here has been working hard to ensure that everything is the way it is supposed to be, he said.Wild said this was the biggest show he had ever worked on, which came with its own set of challenges as it combined dancing, acting and singing. The rehearsal process has been intense, especially the one involving dance because it would take a day or two for the crew to learn the choreography .Wild said although the musical was set in the 1950s, it is staggeringly relevant to South Africa today. I think the basic Romeo and Juliet story is always going to be relevant because it s about people from two opposing sides who fall in love with each other. That s always going to be a potent reality in our world, he said. 701578TNA REPORTER
