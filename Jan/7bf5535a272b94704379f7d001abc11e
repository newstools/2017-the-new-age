South Africa won the toss and decided to bowl in the first one-day international against Sri Lanka at St George&#8217;s Park on Saturday.With a strong westerly wind blowing across the ground, South Africa captain AB de Villiers said he hoped to take advantage of possible early life in a pitch with patches of green grass.Sri Lanka gave a first international cap to opening batsman Sandun Weerakkody and included leg-break bowler Jeffrey Vandersay, a late addition to their squad.Vandersay and Lahiru Kumara replaced Seekkuge Prasanna and Isuru Udana, although Kumara was not in Saturday&#8217;s starting line-up.South Africa were without fast bowling discovery Lungi Ngidi, who was ruled out of the series after suffering a hip injury during the third and final Twenty20 international in Cape Town on Wednesday.All-rounder Chris Morris, recovered from an ankle injury, was included in the South Africa side for his first international match since last June.Teams:South Africa: AB de Villiers (captain), Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock (wkt), Faf du Plessis, JP Duminy, David Miller, Chris Morris, Wayne Parnell, Andile Phehlukwayo, Kagiso Rabada, Imran Tahir.Sri Lanka: Upul Tharanga (captain), Niroshan Dickwella, Sandun Weerakkody, Kusal Mendis, Dinesh Chandimal (wkt), Dhananjaya de Silva, Asela Gunaratne, Nuwan Kulasekara, Jeffrey Vandersay, Suranga Lakmal, Lakshan Sandakan.Umpires: Bongani Jele (RSA), Richard Kettleborough (ENG)TV umpire: Richard Illingworth (ENG)Match referee: Richie Richardson (WIS)-AFP
