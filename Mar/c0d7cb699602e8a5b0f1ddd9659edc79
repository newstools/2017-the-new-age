Democracy is being threatened by populism and by those who &#8220;propose to build walls and close borders&#8221;, France&#8217;s foreign minister said Thursday in a veiled criticism of US President Donald Trump.Jean-Marc Ayrault called on countries to tackle isolationism, warning that &#8220;we would make a grave, collective mistake if we were to give in to the rise of extreme politics&#8221; by forgetting the lessons of the two world wars.US President Donald Trump has vowed to build a wall on the Mexican border to keep out migrants, and in an address to Congress Tuesday stood by his plan to subject travellers from certain countries seen as a risk to &#8220;extreme vetting&#8221;.&#8220;Those who present themselves as critics of the &#8216;system&#8217; are actually attacking democratic institutions,&#8221; Ayrault said in a speech at Australian think tank the Lowy Institute in Sydney.&#8220;Those who propose to build walls and close borders do not have any solution for the security of our nations and are threatening their prosperity.&#8221;America&#8217;s European allies have also been rattled by Trump&#8217;s criticism of NATO and the European Union and his softer approach on Russia, fearing a move towards isolationism as part of his &#8220;America First&#8221; strategy.France is facing its own populist uprising led by far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who has promised a vote on EU membership if elected and is currently forecast to win the first round of elections on April 23 but lose the May 7 run-off.&#8220;I am certain that the extreme right-wing party would not gain power in France but&#8230; it&#8217;s (certainly not) business as usual,&#8221; said Ayrault, who is in Australia to grow French political and economic ties after the inking of a Aus$50 billion (US$38 billion) submarine deal last year.-AFP
