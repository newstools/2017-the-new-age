The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has added another charge against the twin brothers accused of planning to set off explosives at a US embassy and Jewish institutions.NPA spokesperson Luvuyo Mfaku said they had added a fraud charge against the twins, and it will be added to their indictment as the 12th charge.Brandon-Lee and Tony-Lee Thulsie, 23, who appeared in the Johannesburg Magistrate s Court yesterday, are facing charges of contravening the Protection of Constitutional Democracy Against Terrorist and Related Activities Act.The twins were arrested in July last year on suspicion that they had been plotting terrorist attacks against the US mission in Johannesburg and Jewish cultural sites.State prosecutor Chris MacAdam told the court that he had an indictment which contained 12 charges including an additional charge from Ficksburg in the Free State. The 12th charge is in connection with the twins presenting Lesotho passports with the names Christian Adams Leroy and Germain Adams Troy to the Department of Home Affairs officials manning the border post between South Africa and Lesotho.The state also proposed that the matter be transferred to the high court. The case was postponed to May 15 when a date will be finalised for the twins to appear in the high court.MacAdam told magistrate Pieter Du Plessis that once a transfer to the high court was requested, a date would be scheduled for a pre-trial hearing.But the suspects lawyer, Annelene van den Heever, argued that the case should be struck off the roll and that the state needed to get its house in order. This matter should be struck off the roll and reinstated when the state has more evidence to place the matter back on the roll, she said at the time.According to their charge sheet, the brothers, who were arrested along with siblings Ebrahim and Fatima Patel, were allegedly linked to the self-proclaimed Islamic State group and were allegedly planning to set off explosives at a US embassy and Jewish institutions in South Africa.The investigating officer said the twins had been active on social media prior to their arrests, discussing matters that could incriminate them.They were released on R5000 bail each after their lawyer at the time, Yousha Tayob brought an urgent application to the high court in Johannesburg for their release.NONDUMISO ZWANEnondumiso@thnewage.co.za
