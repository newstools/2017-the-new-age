To some, the Bulls rallying cry to up their game may sound like yet another empty statement considering their recent form away from home.Since the start of the Super Rugby season, the Tshwane side have lost three matches away, winning just once against the Sunwolves. The most recent loss was their opening tour match against the Blues, which plunged Nollis Marais team further into disarray. At 8.30am they face a Chiefs side that have won all of their first four fixtures this season.Despite the mountain that they have to climb, Marais has decided to put on a brave face, urging his side to finally prove their worth against one of the competition s favourites. We have a lot to improve. We cannot be proud of that last 40 minutes we produced against the Blues last week. We are a better team than that.We have an opportunity against a great team to prove that, Marais said. The Tshwane side will have Arno Botha available for the first time this year, while regular captain Adriaan Strauss will start, with Handre Pollard getting more freedom to control the backline, while Jesse Kriel has moved to fullback.Other than the Bulls, South Africa will witness two local derbies tomorrow when the Cheetahs take on the unbeaten Stormers in Cape Town, while the Lions host the Sharks at Emirates Airline Park. The Sharks match will see the young Madosh Tambwe get another chance after a good showing against the Reds and two tries against the Kings.The Sharks will also look to Cobus Reinach to produce a sterling performance come kickoff at 5.15pm tomorrow.-Mmasekepe Matsebane|mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
