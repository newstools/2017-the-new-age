New Zealand&#8217;s Joseph Parker will defend his World Boxing Organisation (WBO) heavyweight title against Britain&#8217;s Hughie Fury in Auckland on May 6, his promoters said Wednesday.It will be Parker&#8217;s first defence of the belt he won in December after it was vacated by Tyson Fury, Hughie&#8217;s cousin.&#8220;Joseph loves fighting at home in front of his Kiwi fans so we really wanted to give him that opportunity against a truly dangerous, gifted young opponent in Hughie Fury,&#8221; Parker&#8217;s Duco Events promoter David Higgins said.Both young fighters are undefeated, with 25-year-old Parker boasting a 22-0 record, 18 by knockout, and Fury, 22, at 20-0, with 10 knockouts.Most interest in the fight will be on who the winner meets next, with potential unification bouts looming involving Britain&#8217;s IBF champion Anthony Joshua or American WBC title holder Deontay Wilder.Higgins confirmed Duco had already been in discussions with representatives for Wilder and Joshua &#8212; who fights ex-champ Wladimir Klitschko in London next month &#8212; although he insisted Parker&#8217;s main focus was Hughie Fury.Further complicating the heavyweight scene, Tyson Fury this week hinted he would return against an unknown opponent on May 13.Duco said Tyson &#8212; who surrendered his belts in October after admitting taking cocaine to combat depression &#8212; was expected to join his cousin&#8217;s entourage in Auckland.In a promotional video released by Duco to coincide with the Parker fight announcement, Hughie Fury spoke of creating a heavyweight dynasty with his cousin.&#8220;I&#8217;ll win this title, then Tyson can come back and we can both rule the heavyweight division together,&#8221; he said.-AFP
