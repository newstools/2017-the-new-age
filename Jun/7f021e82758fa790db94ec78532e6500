Western Cape Premier Helen Zille says the notion of decolonisation is being used as the latest trend in South African political discourse intended to portray whites as the reason for the country&#8217;s problems.Zille made the comments following day one of her disciplinary hearing in Cape Town where she is facing charges of bringing the DA into disrepute.&#8220;Whites are not the problem in South Africa. 90% of whites want to contribute and make South Africa work,&#8221; she said.Zille also hit out at the ANC saying the ruling party is using the white minority in the country as scapegoats for its various failures.&#8220;Increasingly minorities are being used as scapegoats in South Africa for the ANC&#8217;s failure to make this country work with all the resources at their disposal,&#8221; she said.&#8220;Suddenly it becomes, its the whites fault. Suddenly it&#8217;s white monopoly capitals fault and ironically that narrative was framed in Britain by Bell-Pottinger and has been picked up by everybody.&#8221;-TNA Reporter
