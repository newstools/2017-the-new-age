Liverpool ensured a return to the Champions League by beating relegated Middlesbrough on Sunday, although they will have to play in a qualifying round after finishing fourth in the Premier League, two points behind Manchester City.Needing a win to make sure of a return to Europe&#8217;s premier club competition, Juergen Klopp&#8217;s side looked edgy early on but the tension was lifted just before halftime when Dutchman Georgino Wijnaldum scored from a clever pass by Roberto Firmino.In the second half Philippe Coutinho curled in a direct free kick and Adam Lallana added a third goal.Middlesbrough, who thought they should have had a penalty with the score at 0-0, finished as the lowest Premier League scorers this season with 27 goals.-Reuters
