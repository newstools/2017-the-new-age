Humility, humour, humanity and a tireless leader.This is how many remembered ANC stalwart and anti-apartheid icon Ahmed Kathrada.Kathrada, 87, passed away in the early hours of the morning yesterday at the Donald Gordon Hospital in Johannesburg where he had been recovering following surgery to remove a blood clot on his brain. His health took a turn for the worse on Monday.Tributes poured in from far and wide yesterday as many remembered him for his fight for a democratic South Africa at the Nelson Mandela Foundation yesterday.Uncle Kathy as he was affectionately known to many was remembered for his tireless struggle against the apartheid regime and his contribution to a democratic and non racial society.Fellow ANC struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela sobbed as her daughter, Zenani Madela-Dlamini, remembered Uncle Kathy.Among those who remembered Kathrada s selfless struggle against apartheid and his kindness was Sophie de Bruyn, human rights lawyer George Bizos and Gauteng Premier David Makhura.Zenani called on South Africans to always remember the sacrifices that Kathrada and others made for this country.Mandela-Dlamini described Uncle Kathy as a brother, confidant and father. Perhaps the real treasure of any man, a man s life isn t what they mean to their immediate family but rather how many outsiders considered them flesh and blood for uncle Kathy as it is for my father it is abundantly clear that millions of South Africans consider them as relatives of the first order and that for me mirrors so eloquently their very special political achievement, Mandela-Dlamini said.Madikizela-Mandela could not stop sobbing when her daughter remembered uncle Kathy.She described the death of Kathrada as a rehash of Madiba s death, saying it was very emotional for her.De Bruyn remembered Kathrada for his kindness, integrity, hard work and commitment.She remembered how Kathrada organised and gave her money to buy a ticket to go home for Christmas when he found her crying because she did not have money to go home.De Bruyn is the only surviving leader of the famous Women s March.Barbara Masekela said Kathrada had died an unhappy man. I can imagine how pained he was that he left at this point in time. All that he had fought for is not what is going on today, Masekela said.Bizos described Kathrada as a very clever person, saying he gave prison authorities a tough time.Meanwhile, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa said: He will be remembered as an unassuming freedom fighter, whose wisdom, tolerance, humility, steadfastness and humour earned him the love and respect of our people. Kathrada will be laid to rest today.LERATO DIALEleratod@thenewage.co.za
