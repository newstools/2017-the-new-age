French President Francois Hollande on Wednesday spoke out against what he said was a decline in women&#8217;s rights in the United States and Russia.Speaking on International Women&#8217;s Day, the French leader said that &#8220;threats of backtracking&#8221; on women&#8217;s rights don&#8217;t just come from &#8220;emerging nations or countries under dictatorships, but also in developed and rich countries&#8221;.&#8220;What about positions or intentions expressed by the new US administration?&#8221; he asked.They would &#8220;reduce funding for family planning, as if this is the first cut to be made to allow an increase in military spending,&#8221; he added.Hollande also took aim at Moscow&#8217;s policies, pointing out that a law that penalised violence against family members had recently been modified.&#8220;Why would anyone change this text except to once again attack the freedom of women?&#8221; he complained.Hollande, who is coming to the end of his tenure and not standing for re-election, added that in Poland there had recently been protests against attempts to impose a near total ban on abortions.Such moves to row back on women&#8217;s rights stem from &#8220;religious fundamentalism&#8221; and &#8220;the resurgence of reactionary ideologies which intend to reassign women to the procreative role in the domestic sphere,&#8221; he said.-AFP
