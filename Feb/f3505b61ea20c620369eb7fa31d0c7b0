Banks need tougher rules to cover financial market abuses, Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan said on Wednesday.&#8220;As we have seen recently with the Competition Commission investigation, there is evidence of a collusive culture at trading desks in banks.&#8220;It is precisely to deal with such abuses that we have proposed a dedicated market conduct regulator, and we hope Parliament will pass this Bill as soon as possible,&#8221; Gordhan said.Delivering the budget speech for 2017, the Minister said the Reserve Bank and National Treasury have initiated work on a comprehensive Financial Markets Review.&#8220;Collusion must be stamped out whether it is in banking, construction or the bread industry. But banks need tougher rules to cover financial market abuses,&#8221; he said.He added that more work needs to be done to transform the financial sector.&#8220;Three new banks have been granted provisional licences, including the PostBank, and two new stock exchanges.Their business models are based on technological innovation with potential to bring services more cost-effectively to more people,&#8221; Gordhan said.He said they will work with partners at NEDLAC who have requested a Financial Sector Summit which will take place in 2017 to tackle transformation in the sector.-TNA Reporter
