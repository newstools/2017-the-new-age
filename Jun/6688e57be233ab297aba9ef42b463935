THE iSimangaliso Wetland Park Authority and Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, have completed the re-dehorning of rhino on the western shores section of the park. This reflects the park s continued commitment to put the rhinos and their safety first. The successful dehorning operation was kept under wraps so as to not encourage a rush in poaching efforts.It was carried out over four days under a special threatened protected species permit issued by the national Department of Environmental Affairs, the park said. Andrew Zaloumis CEO of iSimangaliso, said the park was the first to dehorn rhinos in 2015. The decision was not taken lightly. We were aware that this section of the World Heritage Site is one of those more vulnerable to poaching and still is. Poaching activity in KZN began to increase as poachers were deflected from the Kruger National Park. Like toenails, horns do regrow, which increases the risk of poaching over time and although dehorning is not a guarantee to stop poaching it has shown to be a significant deterrent on the western shores, Zaloumis said.Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife vets and a specialist game capture team were brought in by helicopter. The procedure, which can be likened to cutting a toenail takes about 20 minutes and is completely painless. Provided the entire population is targeted, there are no known social side effects. 701198
