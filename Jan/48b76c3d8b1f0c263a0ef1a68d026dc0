In the event, fourth seed Simona Halep was the only major casualty as soaring afternoon temperatures gave way to a cool evening at Melbourne Park.Australia&#8217;s often hot-headed Nick Kyrgios was uncharacteristically calm as he thumped Gastao Elias 6-1, 6-2, 6-2, despite a nosebleed which halted him mid-match.But Wawrinka drew gasps as he smashed a volley straight at a static Martin Klizan deep in the fifth set, en route to a difficult 4-6, 6-4, 7-5, 4-6, 6-4 win.In the event, fourth seed Simona Halep was the only major casualty as soaring afternoon temperatures gave way to a cool evening at Melbourne Park. Australia&#8217;s often hot-headed Nick Kyrgios was uncharacteristically calm as he thumped Gastao Elias 6-1, 6-2, 6-2, despite a nosebleed which halted him mid-match. But Wawrinka drew gasps as he smashed a volley straight at a static Martin Klizan deep in the fifth set, en route to a difficult 4-6, 6-4, 7-5, 4-6, 6-4 win.&#8220;I stopped playing. He could play anywhere, the whole court,&#8221; a perplexed Klizan said. &#8220;He could play anywhere on the court and he hit me.&#8221; As afternoon temperatures topped 32 degrees Celsius (90 degrees Fahrenheit), Murray came through a two hours, 47 minutes test against Ukraine&#8217;s Illya Marchenko 7-5, 7-6 (7/5), 6-2.He fared better than Kei Nishikori and Marin Cilic, who were both taken to five sets, while Federer was extended 7-5, 3-6, 6-2, 6-2 by Austria&#8217;s Jurgen Melzer. &#8220;Any match is a good match,&#8221; said the 35-year-old Federer, who missed the second half of 2016 with a knee injury.&#8221;Even if I would have lost today, it would have been good because I&#8217;m back on the court.&#8221;Kerber, defending a Grand Slam title for the first time, laboured past Ukraine&#8217;s Lesia Tsurenko 6-2, 5-7, 6-2 in an unconvincing performance.The German was an early loser at both of her warm-up tournaments and she took time to settle against Tsurenko. But she also started slowly last year, when she had to save a match point against Misaki Doi in the first round. &#8216;I&#8217;m dying, I guess&#8217; &#8220;The first round is always tough. I&#8217;m just trying to enjoy it and I&#8217;m so so happy to be in the second round,&#8221; Kerber said. Halep is rated as one of the fastest players on the circuit but her usual zip was glaringly absent as she went down 6-3, 6-1 to American rising star Shelby Rogers.Afterwards she said a knee injury had slowed her down as she succumbed in the first round for the second consecutive year.Venus Williams, the oldest player in the women&#8217;s draw at 36, also found herself with a fight on her hands but she came through 7-6 (7/5), 7-5 against 22-year-old Kateryna Kozlova. &#8220;Girl, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she told on-court interviewer Samantha Smith, who pointed out that Williams turned professional in 1994, the year that Kozlova was born. &#8220;I know how to play tennis. I like to think I&#8217;m good at this. She hasn&#8217;t had the years that I&#8217;ve had yet, the grey hairs and I&#8217;m dying, I guess. The wrinkles that I&#8217;m hiding&#8230; you&#8217;re trying to make me feel old!&#8221;Japan&#8217;s Nishikori, who says he is primed to win his first major title this year, came through a five-set battle with Russia&#8217;s Andrey Kuznetsov 5-7, 6-1, 6-4, 6-7 (6/8), 6-2. Cilic, the 2014 US Open winner, also needed five as he came from two sets down to dispatch Jerzy Janowicz 4-6, 4-6, 6-2, 6-2, 6-3.China&#8217;s Zhang Shuai, who made a surprise run to last year&#8217;s quarter-finals, had an easier time with a 6-0, 6-3 win over Aliaksandra Sasnovich of Belarus. Olympic champion Monica Puig stormed through 6-0, 6-1 against Patricia Tig before Canada&#8217;s Eugenie Bouchard continued her recent resurgence with a 6-0, 6-4 win over Louisa Chirico.-AFP
