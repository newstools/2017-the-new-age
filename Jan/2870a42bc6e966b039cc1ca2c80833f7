Social media giant Facebook announced Sunday that it will introduce new measures to combat fake news in Germany, as Europe&#8217;s largest economy and most populous nation enters an election year.&#8220;It&#8217;s important to us that the reports and news posted on Facebook are reliable,&#8221; a blog post on the Silicon Valley firm&#8217;s German website read.German politicians have warned that populist parties and foreign nations could use fake news to try and influence parliamentary elections slated for September or October.Facebook&#8217;s new German initiative targets &#8220;unambiguously wrong reports&#8221; being shared on the social media platform.The firm said it would offer a simpler reporting process for users to flag suspected fake news, display warnings next to statements identified as false by independent fact-checking organisations, and cut off advertising revenue to fake news sites presenting themselves as real news organisations.Stories flagged with a fake news warning will not be eligible to be converted into an ad seen by other users or &#8220;promoted&#8221; into other users&#8217; feeds for a fee.&#8220;We think that independent and transparent fact-checking can be a powerful instrument for journalism,&#8221; Facebook said.Nonprofit investigative journalism organisation Correctiv will be the first fact-checking partner in Germany, the firm added, saying that they are &#8220;confident&#8221; of adding other news organisations in future.Facebook&#8217;s latest measures come just days after it announced the creation of a &#8220;Journalism Project&#8221; aimed at boosting the credibility of the information it circulates.-AFP
