The South African Policing Union (Sapu) has welcomed the departure of former national police commissioner Riah Phiyega who ended her term of office on Monday.Sapu general secretary Oscar Skommere said Phiyega s last day was a relief because it will allow the police department to start afresh with a new competent commissioner. We believe the end of Phiyega s term will allow the president to fast track the appointment of the new national commissioner who will bring credibility to the department, Skommere said Phiyega spent five years in office, despite being suspended in October 2015 following the findings of the Farlam Commission of Inquiry and the board of inquiry by judge Neels Claassen into the Marikana massacre.Skommere urged Police Minister Fikile Mbalula to recommend the permanent appointment of acting police commissioner Lt-Gen Lesetja Mothiba to the president. We would be pleased to see Mothiba taking over as national commissioner on a permanent basis, because he is a career police officer and has a vast amount of experience. He is the right person to bring back trust in the police to society, he said.Department spokesperson Vuyo Mhaga said the decision is up to President Jacob Zuma. He said Minister Mbalula will be consulted and they hope the decision will be taken by August.AKANI MANGENAnews@thenewage.co.za
