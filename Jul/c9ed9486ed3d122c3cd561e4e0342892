IN A surprise move, Absa Premiership champions Bidvest Wits yesterday unveiled former Sunderland, Tottenham Hotspur, Everton and Borussia Dortmund star Steven Pienaar as their latest signing.The capture, splashed on Wits s Twitter page, means the Clever Boys are leading in terms of marquee signings in this transfer window, having already brought Daylon Claasen back from Germany and also securing the services of Montenegro defender Slavko Damjanovic.Orlando Pirates and their fans will be hit hard by the move as they were hoping that the former Bafana Bafana captain would join them, having publicly declared his love for the out-of-sorts Soweto side.Champions Wits are building on the outfit that will look to defend the ultimate prize in local football with coach Gavin Hunt doing everything in his power to attract the best talent to Braamfontein.Pienaar took to his Facebook page to also express his future with the club after returning to the country of his birth. Finally back home and proud to be a member of the Bidvest Wits family. Looking forward to a great season in the Absa Premiership! he wrote. Unlike in the past, when Wits were losing players to Mamelodi Sundowns, Kaizer Chiefs, SuperSport United and Pirates, the Students are turning things around, splashing big money on experienced and quality players.This is in contrast to what Hunt complained about a few years ago, saying Wits could not win the league as Sundowns were monopolising the transfer market, buying all the available players. I can tell you right now, Sundowns will buy a new team, Hunt was once quoted as saying on one of the country s premier radio sports shows. In Pienaar, Wits are getting a classy and experienced player who can also help their campaign in the CAF Champions League.Rumours also abound that former Sundowns star Teko Modise will also sign for the Clever Boys. Pienaar last played in the PSL 16 years ago when he played 24 matches for Ajax Cape Town, where he was the club s young player of the season before earning a move to Ajax Amsterdam.He went on to play for 10 years in the tough English Premier League. Pienaar was not expected to return to the country as there was interest for his services in the Netherlands.Pienaar, 35, made 61 appearances for Bafana Bafana and played 214 matches in an injury-troubled decade for three sides in the English Premiership. He also featured for Spurs in the Uefa Champions League under Harry Redknapp.For Wits, this is yet another strong statement in the market as they recently signed Claasen, Bokang Thlone, Damjanovic, James Keene, Nazeer Allie, Granwald Scott, Thabang Monare, Xola Mlambo, Gabadinho Mhango, Eleazar Rodgers, Darren Keet, Sifiso Hlanti, Siboniso Gaxa, Cuthbert Malajila, Mogakolodi Ngele, Bongani Khumalo, Sifiso Myeni and Ejike Uzoenyi.mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za-Mmasekepe Matsebani
