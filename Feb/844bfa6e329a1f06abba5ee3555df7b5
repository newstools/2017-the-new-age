Bidvest Wits claimed top of the Absa Premiership after a 2-1 away win over troubled Orlando Pirates on Wednesday night as the midweek fixtures wrapped up. The two goals which came from Frank Mhango handed full three points to the clever boys and saw the campaign for a win by Orlando Pirates continue running fruitless. The mighty Buccaneers have now played seven successive matches in the premier league without testing a single victory. Chaos erupted in their match against the on form Mamelodi Sundowns when they were squashed to a 6-0 loss. Orlando pirates team&#8217;s supporters were not happy about it as they clashed with Mamelodi Sundowns in anger. Bidvest Wits claimed to the top of the league with only a goal difference separating them from the second placed Cape Town City. Meanwhile SuperSport United could have claimed the top of the league had they managed a win against Free State Stars but the game ended in a 0-0 draw . The Absa Premiership will continue on Saturday and Sunday this coming weekend . The Clever boys will seek to maintain their top log lead after a long rest when they host Baroka FC at the Bidvest Stadium next week Wednesday evening . -TNA Reporter
