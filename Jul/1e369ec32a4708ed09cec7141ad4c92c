A MOZAMBICAN man who was driving the truck that collided with two minibuses on the R541 between Machadodorp and Belfast in a horror crash last week will appear in the Belfast Magistrate s Court today.Sebastian Macuacua was remanded in custody on a charge of culpable homicide pending a formal bail application. The crash left 18 people dead and another 15 injured while they were being transported to work at the mine.Some of the deceased were laid to rest in Machadodorp on Saturday. Four others will be buried in Limpopo. Community safety, security and liaison MEC Pat Ngomane s spokesperson Joseph Mabuza said three other victims would also be laid to rest in the Eastern Cape next week.Mabuza said the other three would be buried in KZN and another one would also be buried in Free State. The truck driver, who is seemingly a Mozambican national, will be back in court to explain what could have exactly caused the accident which claimed so many lives of breadwinners and left their families in pain. He is the only driver who can now explain since the other drivers of the minibuses are among the deceased, Mabuza said. He said the arrest of the suspect would discourage other drivers to continue ignoring traffic rules.FRANCE NYAKA francen@thenewage.co.za
