Alain Delon, the French star dubbed one of &#8220;the best looking actors of all time&#8221;, declared Tuesday that he was calling time on his career.The 81-year-old screen legend &#8212; who is credited with inventing the character of the cerebral hitman, which has since become a Hollywood standard &#8212; told AFP that he would do one last film and a play before retiring.&#8220;I am the age that I am, and after having the career that I have had I am finishing it&#8230; it is not the end of my life, but the end of my career,&#8221; he said.Delon shot to fame in the early 1960s playing pretty boy killers and schemers in such classic films as &#8220;Plein Soleil&#8221; &#8212; later remade as &#8220;The Talented Mr Ripley&#8221; &#8212; and Luchino Visconti&#8217;s &#8220;The Leopard&#8221;.Hollywood directors from Martin Scorsese to Steven Soderbergh have credited him with creating the template for the thinking trigger man in Jean-Pierre Melville&#8217;s 1969 classic &#8220;Le Samurai&#8221;.Delon has quit the movies once before, in 2000, only to return eight years later playing Julius Caesar in &#8220;Asterix at the Olympic Games&#8221;, saying &#8220;only fools never change their minds&#8221;.But this time his retirement is for real, he told AFP.&#8220;When I used to organise boxing matches, I saw lots of men who regretted fighting on for too long. There won&#8217;t be one fight too many (for me),&#8221; he added.His swansong film &#8212; which will be directed by renowned French filmmaker Patrice Leconte, who has compiled an encyclopaedia of the actor&#8217;s life &#8212; is a story of a man very much in Delon&#8217;s image.&#8220;The script is almost finished. It is a great love story. It hasn&#8217;t got a title yet but my character is pretty much me,&#8221; Delon said.&#8220;A man of my age, a bit capricious, cranky and angry who finds love before the end of his life.&#8221;He will play opposite Juliette Binoche, who he described as a &#8220;marvellous actress&#8221;.&#8211; Eventful love life &#8211;Delon&#8217;s love life has long been the fodder of celebrity magazines, with his boyish good looks irresistible to a long line of glamorous actress.It was Vanity Fair magazine that described him as one of the best-looking actors ever.His long and complex relationship with the German actress Romy Schneider &#8212; &#8220;The love of my life&#8221; &#8212; fascinated France until her tragic death in 1982 after taking a mix of alcohol and painkillers.&#8220;I was programmed for success, not happiness. The two don&#8217;t go together,&#8221; said Delon, who now lives with his dogs in the countryside near Paris.He said that he and Leconte, best known for his Oscar-nominated period drama &#8220;Ridicule&#8221; set at the royal court of Versailles, hope to premiere the new film at next year&#8217;s Cannes film festival.&#8220;I would like to go back one last time to say goodbye,&#8221; he said of the festival, where &#8220;The Leopard&#8221; won its top prize, the Palme d&#8217;Or, in 1963.Delon said he will also star in a new play written for him, &#8220;The Twilight of a Holy Monster&#8221;, in which he will play a wounded police inspector who is forced to retired.-AFP
