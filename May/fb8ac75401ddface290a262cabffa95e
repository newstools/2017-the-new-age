Thulani Serero s time at Ajax Amsterdam is certainly over as he seeks a move from the club. He is set for a transfer to France, having seen out the remainder of his three-year contract at Ajax playing for their reserve Jong Ajax side in the Jupiter League.He played only five games, a total of 450 minutes of competitive football all season, excluding the two World Cup qualifier fixtures for Bafana Bafana. Serero, who attracted interest from Belgium and Greece in the past, spent five fruitful seasons with the Dutch giants, winning three league championships and the Dutch Super Cup. But it all went pear-shaped when he battled for form.The improved form he showed towards the end of the season wasn t enough to impress incoming coach Peter Bocz, who sent him to the reserve side. At 27, Serero could still rediscover the form that saw him named PSL footballer of the year, player of the season, players player of the season and young player of the season back in 2011. He has been excluded from the latest Bafana squad for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Nigeria due to his lack of game time.Bafana coach Stuart Baxter fully explained his decision on the 33-time capped South African international. I notified him that I don t think it s fair on him or on the rest of the squad when he d only had 800 minutes of football at top level over the last year, Baxter said. Once he gets to a new address I ll be looking to work with him.It is not one of those situations where if you ve played five games then you are eligible for selection. He could have played six, seven or even 30 games. Each situation is different. -NEVILLE KHOZA|kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
