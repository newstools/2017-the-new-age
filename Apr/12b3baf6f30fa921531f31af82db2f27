President Jacob Zuma has commended Pravin Gordhan for his work as Finance Minster and ensuring a smooth hand-over to his successor Malusi Gigaba.&#8220;This shows the maturity of leadership within the governing party. We appreciate the determination by both leaders to ensure continuity and unity within the portfolio,&#8221; President Zuma said.This comes as Gordhan on Tuesday holds a meeting with Gigaba to brief him on key issues at the national treasury before handing over after he was sacked by President Zuma in the early hours of Friday morning.The meeting between the two was originally meant to take place on Monday but was postponed for Tuesday due to Sars announcing the preliminary outcomes of revenue collection for 2016-17.Zuma who was addressing the launch of the Trans Africa locomotive in Koedoespoort, Pretoria said he has directed Gigaba and his Deputy Sifiso Buthelezi to prioritise unity, peace, cohesion and stability within the Finance portfolio.&#8220;Minister Gigaba and his team will also be reaching out to the international investor community urgently to assure them that South Africa remains a stable, reliable and competitive investment destination. They will build on the good work that has been done thus far,&#8221; said Zuma.The President&#8217;s remarks however come in the face of a announcement by ratings agency Standard and Poor s that it had downgraded the country&#8217;s sovereign credit rating to junk status on Monday.S&amp;P cited the President&#8217;s cabinet reshuffle as a reason for the downgrade. The downgrade reflects our view that the divisions in the ANC-led government that have led to changes in the executive leadership, including the finance minister, have put policy continuity at risk, S&amp;P said.The S&amp;P downgrade has sparked fear of more downgrades with Moody s set to release its review on Friday.Zuma on Tuesday said that while the political leadership had changed at treasury, government s policy would remain the same.&#8220;We also wish to emphasise that Government has been, and will remain, committed to a measured fiscal consolidation that stabilises the rise in public debt,&#8221; he said.National Treasury, in a statement following news of the downgrade, has also committed to improving business confidence. The government remains committed to making sure that its work with business, labour and civil society continues in order to improve business confidence and implement structural reforms to accelerate inclusive growth.&#8221;-TNA Reporter
