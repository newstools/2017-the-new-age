Japan-based SoftBank Group late Thursday announced it is buying animal-based robot maker Boston Dynamics from Google-parent Alphabet.Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but SoftBank portrayed the move as in sync with its vision for robotics.&#8221;Today, there are many issues we still cannot solve by ourselves with human capabilities,&#8221; SoftBank chief executive Masayoshi Son said in a release.&#8220;Smart robotics are going to be a key driver of the next stage of the Information Revolution.&#8221;SoftBank will also buy Japanese bipedal robotics company Schaft as part of its deal with Alphabet, according to the release.&#8220;We share SoftBank&#8217;s belief that advances in technology should be for the benefit of humanity,&#8221; Boston Dynamics chief executive Marc Raibert said in the release.&#8221;We look forward to working with SoftBank in our mission to push the boundaries of what advanced robots can do.&#8221;SoftBank has invested in a human-shaped &#8220;Pepper&#8221; robot that can serve as a helpful companion, while the line-up at Boston Dynamics includes four-legged machines with names like &#8220;Big Dog&#8221; and &#8220;Wildcat.&#8221;Boston Dynamics also has humanoid &#8220;Atlas,&#8221; which uses &#8220;balance and whole-body skills.&#8221;Alphabet bought Boston Dynamics in 2013 and has reportedly been looking to sell the acquisition for about a year.-AFP
