Allow me to give my Easter message to the citizens of this province and the larger South African population.Let me start by repeating what is always said by the Department of Transport that road deaths are not accidents, as they are either caused by ignorance or negligence.If ignorance has any contribution, it is minimal due to vigorous campaigns conducted on road safety education by government.What could be the dominant factor is negligence, which unfortunately can be largely solved through individual commitment to make a change for the better. In the process, all of us are either victims or culprits.The culprits become the victims sometimes because road accidents can leave the culprit permanently paralysed and one only then sees the danger of alcohol and irresponsible driving after the irreparable damage has already been done, by quitting drinking.If the culprits can change their way of doing things, there will be no victims. If other road users can obey the rules of the road, there will be no more road fatalities.Statistics shows that every year, the world loses about 1.25 million people due to road accidents and South Africa is one of those countries significantly contributing to them.In the Bible, in Numbers 13:32, it says there will be a time when the land we explored devours those who are living in it . One may argue this time is what we see today but in reality this time has long passed.The major factor in road accidents is usage of alcohol due to craziness because some of us wrongly attach holidays to illegality.People who drive while drunk have been either drinking with other people, or have been sold liquor by other people, who are sometimes sober.Isn t it time that tavern owners, shebeen owners, family members and those with whom we socialise, take responsibility by preventing those who are drunk from driving?We can delude ourselves by saying traffic officers are not everywhere or might have knocked off duty but what we cannot escape is the fact that drunkenness badly affects one s vision and reaction time, which causes accidents.If we do not deal with alcohol usage as a primary cause of road deaths decisively we are likely to lose the battle.There are also secondary factors that cannot be overlooked. Why do we allow kids to sit in the front seat or why do we use cellphones while driving, although we well know it s against the law? Why are we not using seat belts, which have been proven as lifesavers on many occasions? Why do we give our vehicles to unlicensed drivers if we really care about road safety?As we approach the Easter weekend, it is important that we dramatically decrease road carnage.If we change our mind set that there is nothing special about Easter holidays and December holidays and regard every day as like any other day and every month as like any other month, the Easter and December holidays will not be months associated with road deaths as they are now.The Department of Transport nationally and in all provinces has come up with various programmes as an attempt to stop this carnage. It was Arrive Alive, which was launched annually but road deaths increased every year.The campaign has been changed to a daily one as a further attempt to arrest the situation. I will not talk about the departmental programmes and how people can fit in, because I am not the department spokesperson. The least I can do is what can be done by any other responsible citizen, to appeal to my fellow men and women to be responsible citizens for the good of the whole.The creep of materialism in our society is contributing significantly to road accidents.We will keep on persuading people to refrain from drinking and driving, even if they keep on ignoring our pleas.It is unfortunate that sometimes one finds people who are supposed to be of high moral standing on the wrong side of the law by driving while drunk.Some of these people are legislators who made the same laws which they are breaking.What does this tell us about our society? In my view, if those in leadership positions take road safety seriously, there will be a great decline in road deaths. When talking of leadership, I am not just referring to the elected leaders but any leader recognised as such by society irrespective of the position one holds.I must mention that sometime in our lives, there was a Nelson Mandela and his comrades who led our revolution to where we are today.If the Mandelas, Sisulus, Bikos, Sobukhwes, Tambos and others have led the political revolution, it is time our generation lead the road safety revolution that no amount of money must go paying road accident victims, because there will be no victims to be paid, as South Africa will be a road accident-free society.For this dream to be a reality, it calls upon us as individual citizens to play our roles in ensuring that road safety rules are not just adhered to but are taken seriously as Christians take the Bible seriously.It was during their time of leadership that we learnt that leaders have a responsibility to lead by example. It was during that period when they declared together with us that there ought to be freedom in our lifetime .Let us make our individual contribution to the slogan Accident free society in our lifetime . This is possible only if we believe we can. Borrowing Mandela s words: It seems impossible until it is done. This is the time to do what is expected of us.Zolekile PafaDr Zolekile Pafa (PhD) is the district manager for OR Tambo district in the Eastern Cape department of transport.
