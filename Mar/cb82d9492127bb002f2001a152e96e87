Tyra Banks is to return as host of “America’s Next Top Model” reports Variety. Banks, who created the reality competition series, hosted the first 22 seasons of “Top Model” on UPN before taking a one-season hiatus when the show moved to VH1 for season 23. She was replaced by Rita Ora as host but remained on the show as executive producer.
The season will now stay on VH1 for season 24. The news comes just days after Banks was also announced as the new host of NBC’s “America’s Got Talent,” replacing long-time host Nick Cannon. -Relaxnews
