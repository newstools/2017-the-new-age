The case against eight men who are accused of raping a 13-year-old girl in Nyanga are expected to apply for bail application on Wednesday. The suspects aged 18 and 20, made a brief appearance in the Wynberg Magistrates Court on December 20th 2016. Family members of eight seemed disappointed by yet another postponement in the matter during their appearance. It is alleged that the girl was abducted at gunpoint while walking alone on Robert Sobukwe Road in November 2016 and allegedly taken to a shack where she was repeatedly raped by the accused. Joan van Niekerk of the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect said that the girl and her relatives will require extensive professional support following her rape. In their first appearance the court heard that the girl was actually gang raped by 10 men. Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana said that two suspects were still being sought by the police.-TNA Reporter
