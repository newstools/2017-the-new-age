South African Revenue Service (SARS) Commissioner Tom Moyane has on Friday blamed a cult of personality for the strained relationship between himself and Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.Moyane was speaking during a press conference responding to allegations published in one of the daily newspapers.According to Moyane The State Security Agency has confirmed that the leaking of a series letters between himself and Gordhan &#8220;could only come from Treasury&#8221;.The article alleges that Moyane signed-off on paying a bonus to himself.&#8221; To date I have not paid a bonus to myself, I am waiting for Minister Pravin Gordhan to sign off on it. &#8221; said Moyane.Moyane further alleged that the Finance Minister had interfered in the work done by the revenue service saying that Gordhan had made &#8220;unreasonable delays by on key appointments&#8221; which the commissioner added had further deteriorated their relationship.Moyane also accused Gordhan of further meddling including not approving leave and bonuses for senior employees.Commissioner Moyane also revealed that he had asked President Jacob Zuma to intervene as a result of the deteriorating relationship between himself and Gordhan.The relationship between the two men has apparently deteriorated to the point that according Moyane during meetings Minister Gordhan shouts at him and &#8220;treat me as a non-entity.&#8221;&#8221; I request for respect from finance minister, we all make mistakes and have shortcomings and I have worked hard in my career.&#8221; said Moyane.Moyane also said it was &#8220;regrettable&#8221; that had blamed SARS for the close to R30.4bn revenue shortfall.&#8221; Since February 2016 the economy has failed to grow at anticipated levels.&#8221; said MoyaneHe added that the shortfall was caused by drop in VAT, customs duties and personal income tax which he said was all attributable to slow growth in the economy.&#8221; We must demystify the myth that SARS is dysfunctional. I have a dim view of people saying SARS has no adequate leadership.&#8221; said Moyane.&nbsp;TNA Reporter
