Naledi local municipality in Vryburg remains the only one yet to get out of the woods as it struggles to come up with a sustainable financial plan to meet its obligations to Eskom.Eight other municipalities that owed Eskom have managed to come up with plans to foot their bills and are considered out of danger.Local government and human settlements MEC Galaletsang Gaolaolwe said her department and the provincial treasury were working hard to help municipalities meet their obligations. We are happy to report that of the nine municipalities that owed Eskom, we are only left with one that is still struggling. It s Naledi local municipality but we will continue to do our best in assisting so that it gets back on track, she said.At some point, some of the municipalities experienced power interruptions before national government intervened to stop the power cuts.Naledi and Ventersdorp had failed to come up with convincing payment plans to persuade Eskom to keep them on the grid.Some of those that managed to survive after submitting acceptable plans were Madibeng, Maquassi Hills, Mamusa, Lekwa-Teemaneng and Kgetleng Rivier.Ventersdorp got it easy as the sound financial position of Tlokwe covered for its flaws.The two former local municipalities were merged into one and the debt became a shared responsibility.While the provincial government acknowledged that it owed several local municipalities, Gaolaolwe flatly denied allegations that about R30m was owed to Naledi.The local municipality said the government departments, save for that of health, owed R29.5m, money it said could have been used to pay Eskom.Naledi owes a whooping R232m to the power utility and its annual equitable share of about R40m is in no way assisting.Municipality spokesperson, Kgomotso Mmusi said money running into millions are owed by residents, including about R30m the provincial government departments owed in arrears.In a bid to force the government s hand to pay, the municipality disconnected power to Mini Garona government complex.However, Gaolaolwe said the government accounts were all in order. Yes, we used to owe municipalities but we have paid our accounts and we urge departments to pay up. In Naledi, it is not true that we owe R30m, the only amount outstanding is for January, she said.At the height of the power cuts crisis, Gaolaolwe and her counterpart at the provincial treasury, Wendy Nelson, met with mayors and chief financial officers from the affected municipalities to craft a way out of the combined debt that runs into hundreds of millions of rands.Eskom has been clear that it wants municipal council resolutions that show a commitment to pay and municipalities that manage their own electricity accounts.Indications are that most of the residents do not pay and municipalities end up accumulating huge debts.One such municipality is Madibeng where mayor Jostina Mothibe has called on electricity consumers with arrears to immediately settle their debts to avoid disconnection.She said non-payment of services by consumers had put the municipality under a serious financial strain. This made it difficult for the municipality to pay for bulk electricity services to Eskom. Consumers who would like to enter into settlement agreement with the municipality are urged to do so immediately, Mothibe said.Power cuts affected residents, industries and consumers in general.Madibeng owed about R150m but managed to pay R90m in December 2016 when Eskom first issued the notice to disconnect.It now owes more than R45m in arrears.Mothibe said the disconnection comes as a result of the debt by municipality to Eskom which was caused mainly by nonpayment of services by consumers for services rendered as well as illegal connections of electricity. The municipality will as well disconnect electricity supply to all areas with illegal connections as per the resolution taken by the council, Mothibe said.Premier Supra Mahumapelo said residents should desist from bridging electricity meters and connecting to the grid illegally. We lose millions of rand to these illegal connections and we want residents to understand that services should be paid for. Connecting illegally or conniving with Eskom technicians to bridge meters is a criminal offence.The government is working together with the power utility to find best ways in stopping some of these challenges, he said.North West Eskom spokesperson Loyiso Jiya said the power utility had left the problem of nonpayment for too long. Municipalities should be held to account and all we are saying is that we are ready to allow the municipalities to make payments arrangement to avoid further disconnections and they should stick to it, Jiya said.ELFAS TORERAIelfast@thenewage.co.za
