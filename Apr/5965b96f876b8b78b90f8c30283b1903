&nbsp;The Progressive Professionals Forum says it will approach the Finance Minister, Malusi Gigaba, on an urgent basis to convince him not to rush into signing off Fica Bill before he gives the PPF an audience.While it supported the fight against money laundering and illicit financial flows, it &#8220;also remained committed to ensuring that the South African public is not made vulnerable by laws that do not pass the Constitutional muster,&#8221; the forum&#8217;s general secretary Luther Lebelo said in a statement.It noted that the Bill was not signed in its original form and it would study it to verify if the issues raised by the PPF had been addressed.PPF notes that Parliament made certain amendments to bring the Bill in line with the Constitution following the objection by the President. These amendments effectively mean that the bill was not signed in its original form.&#8220;After taking guidance from PPF legal counsel, PPF will assess its options including approaching appropriate courts for final determination on our views,&#8221; Luther said.Yesterday the Bill signing was generally welcomed with the chair of the Parliamentary committee on Finance, Yunis Carrim saying that the country had lost &#8220;R600 billion in illicit financial flows over the past 10 years. It is big businesses, not emerging black businesses that are primarily responsible for this. It is the poor and disadvantaged who ultimately bear a disproportional burden. &#8211; ANN7 reporter
