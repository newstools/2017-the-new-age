The opening of Ballito Junction is expected to be bumpy as the ANC Youth League (ANCYL) of KwaDukuza, which incorporates Ballito, will be protesting against what it calls exclusion of blacks in the mall s service supply chain.The R1.4bn mall, which will house more than 200 stores, will open its doors tomorrow, with a promise to open up to previously disadvantaged business people and workers from the area.But the ANCYL believes that this was just rhetoric aimed at fooling people into believing that they would benefit from the mall other than being consumers enriching the mall s developers.The ANCYL s Musa Zondi said they want to ensure that the management of the mall gets their message on radical economic transformation.Zondi claimed that most young people from the area who applied for jobs were not considered. It did not end with our young people not getting jobs, our companies were not considered for services like cleaning and guarding. This makes us think that the owners of the mall are not interested in doing business with black people. What they were saying about working with everyone from here was just rhetoric aimed at fooling us, Zondi said.To put their message across, Zondi said members would stage a march and picket in front of the mall when it opens tomorrow morning.The ANCYL has urged local young people to join its march, adding that the league wanted to attract thousands of youth to drive home their rejection of skeleton development intended to racialise the economy of the region at the expense of the majority . We want them to get our message, that we want radical economic transformation now. We will hand over a memorandum of demands to management on the same day and we expect them to act on our demands, Zondi said.Chief among the demands is the employment of people from the area and using KwaDukuza-based service providers in the mall.The mall s spokesperson, Ronica Inarman, when contacted by The New Age, dismissed the ANCYL s allegations as baseless. Those views do not accord with the facts. The co-owners of the mall have no further comment, said Inarman.The Ballito mall is developed and owned by Menlyn Maine and Flanagan &amp; Gerard consortium.The consortium, according to information sourced from its website, owns the Middelburg mall in Mpumalanga, the Vaal mall and the Highveld mall, among others.SIHLE MAVUSO
