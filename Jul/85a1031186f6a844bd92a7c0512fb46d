Philippine boxing legend Manny Pacquiao on Wednesday urged the World Boxing Organization (WBO) to review the &#8220;unfair decision and officiating&#8221; after losing his welterweight title to Australia&#8217;s Jeff Horn.Pacquiao endorsed a formal call by the Philippines&#8217; Games and Amusement Board for the WBO to review the outcome of Sunday&#8217;s fight in Brisbane.&#8220;I love boxing and I don&#8217;t wanna see it dying because of unfair decision and officiating,&#8221; Pacquiao, 38, said in a statement issued by his office.&#8220;I had already accepted the decision but as a leader and, at the same time, fighter I have the moral obligation to uphold sportsmanship, truth and fairness in the eyes of the public,&#8221; said Pacquiao, also a sitting senator.In the twilight of a 22-year pro career in which he won world titles in an unprecedented eight weight divisions, Pacquiao had initially called for a rematch, but later said he would also &#8220;think hard&#8221; about retiring.Widely written off by observers, Horn, 29, shocked Pacquiao with his ultra-aggressiveness to earn a unanimous 12-round decision.A day after the bout, the Philippines&#8217; sports regulatory body wrote the WBO calling for a &#8220;thorough review&#8221; on the decisions of American referee Mark Nelson and the judges.&#8220;We are making this request for a review, which may call for sanctions on the referee and judges if so warranted, in furtherance of our mutual goal of protecting the integrity of the sport,&#8221; the board wrote.Pacquiao attached a copy of the letter to his own statement.&#8220;WBO should take appropriate action on the letter sent by the Games and Amusement Board so as not to erode the people&#8217;s interest in boxing,&#8221; Pacquiao said.The WBO on Tuesday responded to the controversy in its Twitter account.&#8220;The discretion of a referee or judge cannot be reversed, except in a case of fraud or violation of laws which is not the case in Pac vs Horn,&#8221; the WBO said.&#8220;The contract for Pac vs Horn provides a rematch clause, which the WBO is in accordance (with) if the promoters decide to move forward.&#8221;While saying he respected the fight outcome, Pacquiao had questioned the referee&#8217;s decisions and made disparaging comments about Horn.&#8220;He&#8217;s not really good but he&#8217;s really strong,&#8221; Pacquiao said of Horn on Monday, while the Filipino&#8217;s camp criticised the referee for supposedly allowing the undefeated Australian to get away with a host of illegal tactics.&#8220;The problem here is that the referee, I don&#8217;t know if he did it deliberately or he just did not have experience, he just allowed it and did not even give any warning for how many times,&#8221; Pacquiao said.&#8220;It&#8217;s as if the referee wanted to help my opponent.&#8221;-AFP
