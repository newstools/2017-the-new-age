An estimated 750000 people suffer from dementia in South Africa but experts said the number could be higher due to a large number of people who do not have access to healthcare facilities to get a proper diagnosis.Alzheimer s South Africa executive director Petra du Toit, said dementia was not taken seriously enough due to other pressing illnesses such as HIV, TB and diabetes, among others. Although I believe that our government is trying to include dementia in their awareness programmes, it is not sufficient as we find many people are not aware of dementia as a disease, she said.Du Toit said dementia can be tackled by the formation of partnerships between the department of health, social development, the public and private sector and NGOs. We all need to join hands to address this need, as dementia is becoming the most significant health challenge of our time with a new person diagnosed every three seconds, Du Toit said.Gogo *Maria Mothupi, 68, said for years she suffered discrimination and stigma at the hands of her community who accused her of witchcraft and lived in isolation most of her senior years.Mothupi s daughter said she was diagnosed with dementia in 2013, but not before suffering from isolation and stigma.Her daughter said the first sign that there was something wrong was in 2008, when her mother went to one of the community members house to discuss the issue of security in the village following the killing of a woman in the area and halfway there she could not remember where she was going or how she got there. We thought that it was just stress related, as we recently lost our dad, but word quickly got around and you know people talk. The next week she was found sleeping in one of our neighbour s yards and looked confused, she said.She said those two incidents earned her mother the title of a witch and changed the course of her life.Mothupi was later taken to a number of traditional doctors, however her condition got worse when she started hallucinating. After years of hell, we finally took her to Joburg where she was diagnosed and for a second there we thought it was a joke as we were expecting the worst. For us, it came with a lot of questions but for the community that stigma remained, she said. The broader SA community needs information with regard to dementia, as it is still stigmatised and in some communities people with dementia are seen as witches, Du Toit said.She said while the organisation tried to reach out to remote areas of the country, as a non-profit organisation they did not have sufficient resources to reach all areas.LERATO DIALEleratod@thenewage.co.za
