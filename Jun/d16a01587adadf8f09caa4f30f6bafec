The ANC Youth League (ANCYL) yesterday condemned the judicial branch of the government as counter-revolutionary.ANCYL treasurer-general Reginald Nkabinde launched an offensive against the courts and the media, accusing them of being unrelenting in their criticism of the ruling party.He accused the courts and the media of being pessimistic about the ruling party on matters of governance.Anything that has to do with a leader or a deployee of the ANC that goes to court comes back as negative. We ve made an assessment that courts on their own have taken a decision to be enemies of the revolution. Anything that has to do with the ANC will lose in court, Nkabinde said.ANC general secretary Njabulo Nzuza echoed Nkabinde s sentiments. He claimed that the courts were suffering from a credibility crisis. Obviously there are credibility issues we need to look into. We used to say when you are sober, you are sober as a judge but one of the judges was caught having smashed through the door of a person s house, the judge was drunk. You can t even say sober as a judge today, he said.ANCYL president Collen Maine also shared his reflections on comments attributed to ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe, describing the young lions as henchmen for a dominant faction in the ruling party.He said the ANCYL would seek an audience with Mantashe on the matter. These comrades, we must firstly indicate we are disappointed. We expect better from them as leaders. But what we will not do is what they are doing. We ll demonstrate leadership to them and engage with them on their views. We won t stoop to their level. We must also engage what informs these sudden attacks on the youth league but we will engage them internally. Mantashe addressed a central committee gathering of the National Union of Mineworkers last week and said that the league had reduced themselves to being a personal army of a faction in the ruling party.Bonolo Selebanobonolos@thenewage.co.za
