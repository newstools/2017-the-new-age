South Africa needs to use migration as a vehicle for tapping critical skills from more advanced countries.Home Affairs Minister Prof Hlengiwe Mkhize, who was recently at the Global Forum on Migration and Development in Berlin, Germany, said this during a Progressive Business Forum breakfast meeting yesterday. The forum is running alongside the ANC s fifth policy conference.She said while in Germany at the migration forum there was a lot of interest in South Africa from North America and other parts of the world. Mkhize said it was important for the country to enter into strategic partnerships with more advanced countries for access to critical skills. Much as we are looking at security when people are entering the country, in terms of partnerships with business, we have to start a process whereby migration is used as a vehicle for development and creating jobs, she said.Mkhize said it was time the country aggressively sought such partnerships regionally and at the global level. We talk about the future that is unknown, the jobs that will be there, we need to partner with countries that are leading in those and have fast-tracked migration for development and jobs. We must not only think about controlling and securing our space, she said.Mkhize said the recent passing of the Border Management Authority Bill was a welcome development. We want to create a situation whereby defence, police and SARS, are able to work with Home Affairs to manage ports of entry, she said.She stressed the need to tighten the country s entry points. I think what has been a problem in South Africa, we have these borders that are porous with people entering through the fences and some swimming across the rivers. It s been chaotic on the ground but we have made a commitment that we will work even at a community level. MTHOKOZISI DUBEmtokozisid@thenewage.co.za
