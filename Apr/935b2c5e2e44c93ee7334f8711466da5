common cause: Opposition parties and South Africans across the rainbow nation marched to the Union Buildings united in will demanding the president resign. Picture: Herbert Matimba The good attribute about the study of philosophy is that it opens the blind eyes of men and women, clearing their mental cobwebs to the complexities of the world, helping society avoid ad hominem arguments that are nothing but sledgehammers meant to destroy characters rather than clarify issues.We make assumptions that, in general, humans are rational. They ought to use their mental capacities to distil between right and wrong and that this process has evolved over many centuries. Modern man and woman ought to know, as clear as day, that they ought to act in a rational way, using facts and only facts to arrive at certain important decisions and conclusions.If we take a hypothetical case of an enraged man who wants to shoot and kill another person, he ought to have facts to justify his killing of another person, if at all.He would, for example, have said: I will kill so-and-so because he is a threat to my own survival and so before he kills me, I will have to kill him first. But even if it is factually true that your life may have been be in danger of extinction, what will a rational person do to avoid killing another person? He will surely have to consider a number of facts which, among other things, include considering that to kill is not only immoral, it is also criminal and that anyone found guilty of murder by any competent court of law might be sentenced to a jail term.In some countries, a murderer is sentenced to death, which can include death by stoning or torture, such as being hanged. In South Africa and in many democracies, a constitution protects even murderers from being killed by the state.To hang another person as a form of penal punishment was outlawed in South Africa because it was found to be unconstitutional, infringing on the Bill of Rights enshrined in the Constitution. In six words, the Bill of Rights says Everyone has the right to life , which by implication also refers to a murderer found guilty by a competent court of law.At the onset of our democracy, many people, including religious people of all ilk, including Christians, were upset when the death penalty was abolished and declared unconstitutional in our constitutional democracy.The proponents of the death penalty strenuously argued that it was the law of God that permitted punishment by ending a person s life when that person had killed another person, screaming to high heaven that the ancient scriptures demanded an eye for an eye and a life for a rule be exacted as a punishment.Where am I going with this argument? The rainbow nation wheels, as propounded by both former president Nelson Mandela and archbishop Desmond Tutu, may be coming off. There is too much acrimony among members of society.On April 27, 1994, when for the first time in history all the rainbow people of this country went to the polls with blacks for the first time, claiming their right to exercise their vote, the new nation that unshackled the chains of oppression was born.Mandela would become a popularly elected leader of the new South Africa, heralding a new order in which oppression gave way to a long reign of injustice and oppression, with the ANC styling itself as the leader of society.Today, 23 years after democracy, the divisions are sharp and pronounced among comrades. It has become easy for stalwarts of the struggle to hurl insults and barbs at each other.The beautiful art of formulating good and sound arguments, and thrashing out differences, not by engaging in a debate and failure to construct sound arguments to clarify standpoints, has become an art that is slowly dissipating.It is easy to castigate others who do not belong to the same camp as belonging to the enemy camp. Indeed, name calling has replaced robust debates . Good comrades of the struggle use strange and foreign language inconsistent with the heritage bestowed as a heritage by the patriarchs and matriarchs of the ANC.There are those who are described as captured by the state and some labelled as being driven by the agenda of white monopoly capital, whatever that might means. Some are described as patrons of some obscure shebeens in some leafy suburbs, without much detail being given as to what this might mean.It is said that reason gives rise to ethical discourse and healthy debate and engagement and if this is true, the question must beasked:Have we lost all reason that we can resort to insults, that we fail to engage one another in a constructive and thoughtful way, even as we differ ideologically and politically?It is said that reason requires impartiality and this statement has serious implications for truthfulness and reason.EFF leader Julius Malema at one of the recent protest marches, described President Jacob Zuma as Makhandakhanda, which means the one with a big head. The president himself described the marches as racist, which is factually incorrect.Both statements are problematic and are based on the lack of clarity of mind and so resides in the realm of argumentum ad hominem, a ploy meant to appeal more to feelings and prejudices rather than intellect or logic.We are building a new non-racial South Africa.We need to tolerate one another, even as we take to streets to protest against one thing or the other. The Bill of Rights demands of us to take to heart that: Everyone has inherent dignity and the right to have their dignity respected and protected. If I disagree or do not like the president, that does not entitle me to hurl insults at him, for to do so would be tantamount to disrespecting his inherent dignity, whatever I may think of him.This is the road we all have to walk, respecting the dignity of our sworn enemies and not in any way seeking to disparage them even as we disagree with them.If we do that, we shall be on our way to building ethical communities.Jo-Mangaliso Mdhlela is a commentator and heads The New Age/ANN7 journalism academy In building a non-racial rainbow nation, South Africans need to tolerate each other, even when protesting against one thing or another JO-MANGALISO MDHLELA Analysis
