Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane rounded on his team&#8217;s detractors on Tuesday ahead of the King&#8217;s Cup quarter-final second leg at Celta Vigo, saying their recent blip in form has been exaggerated.Real set a Spanish record of 40 games unbeaten in all competitions earlier in January and remain top of the La Liga standings by a point with a game in hand on title rivals Barcelona and Sevilla.A first league defeat of the season by Sevilla and a 2-1 loss to Celta Vigo in the Cup removed the team&#8217;s veneer of invincibility, however, and Saturday&#8217;s unconvincing 2-1 win over Malaga did little to stem the criticism, with Real&#8217;s supporters booing their players during the game.&#8220;Listening to some of these questions you&#8217;d think we were battling relegation,&#8221; Zidane told reporters ahead of Wednesday&#8217;s trip to Celta Vigo where his side need to overturn a 2-1 deficit to advance to the semi-finals.&#8220;I&#8217;m not worried and neither are the players. We&#8217;re in high spirits,&#8221; the Frenchman added. &#8220;Tomorrow we have a really exciting game.&#8221;Celta rested players in their league defeat at Real Sociedad at the weekend in preparation for the second leg and Zidane will field a full-strength team.&#8220;We&#8217;re going to try and win everything we have in front of us and that&#8217;s not going to change, we&#8217;re not going to throw in the towel,&#8221; he said.&#8220;If we don&#8217;t win (the tie) it wouldn&#8217;t be our biggest failure, although I&#8217;m not contemplating that at the moment.&#8221;Real are missing six players through injury with Colombia international James Rodriguez ruled out unexpectedly after straining a calf muscle just after recovering from another leg problem.Midfielder Luka Modric and defender Marcelo sustained injuries against Malaga while full back Dani Carvajal&#8217;s absence means out-of-favour left back Fabio Coentrao has been called into the squad.-Reuters
