Lewis Hamilton&#8217;s Mercedes are vowing to come back hard in China after being ambushed by resurgent Ferrari in the Formula One season-opener in Australia.The German outfit, who have ruled the sport for the last three years, got a rude awakening in the first race of the new season when Sebastian Vettel beat Hamilton by almost 10 seconds in Melbourne on Sunday.Vettel&#8217;s triumph has overturned early-season expectations and raised the prospect of a Ferrari-Mercedes battle for the world title over the remaining 19 races.All eyes will now be on the next grand prix in Shanghai on April 9 to see if Ferrari can repeat their improved performance through Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen.&#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t already clear after qualifying, then it&#8217;s certainly clear now that this is going to be a season of very small margins,&#8221; Mercedes technical director James Allison said.&#8220;Credit to Ferrari, they had a very quick car and we just weren&#8217;t quite good enough to stick with them. We won&#8217;t panic, though.&#8220;It&#8217;s race one of a long season and we scored some very good points with both cars in Melbourne. We&#8217;ll be determined to come back stronger in China and make sure those small margins go our way next time.&#8221;While Vettel&#8217;s first win for Ferrari since Singapore in 2015, and his 43rd victory overall, has supercharged the season, he said there was still a lot of work to do.&#8220;This is one of many steps and we have to enjoy what we do. It&#8217;s great to see people smiling,&#8221; said Vettel. &#8220;Now we have to reset to go to China and try to do a good job.&#8221;&#8211; &#8216;About time&#8217; for Ferrari &#8211;Ferrari president Sergio Marchionne said the team returning to the top of the podium was long overdue, with the victory meaning a non-Mercedes driver leads the championship for the first time since 2013.&#8220;It was about time,&#8221; Marchionne said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been waiting for this victory for almost a year-and-a-half. Hearing the Italian national anthem again was very moving.&#8220;Sebastian delivered a great race and I am sure Kimi will be soon up there battling alongside his team-mate.&#8221;But like Vettel, Marchionne is not getting carried away at the start of a globe-trotting season which will wrap up in Abu Dhabi in November.&#8220;It is absolutely essential to remember that this is not the destination but the first step on a long road that must see us all focused on improving each and every day,&#8221; he said.Shanghai will also be an opportunity for Australian Daniel Ricciardo to bounce back after his traumatic outing in Melbourne.The amiable Red Bull driver crashed in qualifying, was hit with a grid penalty and started Sunday&#8217;s race from pit lane, before his car stopped on lap 29 of his 58-lap home GP.&#8220;Sure, I&#8217;m disappointed now but it is what it is. I&#8217;ve been here before so I&#8217;ll wake up tomorrow and be motivated to get ready for China,&#8221; Ricciardo said after the race.&#8220;If any Aussies have a bit of energy left in a few weeks, then come out to China and you&#8217;ll hopefully see a better race from me.&#8221;The weekend setback continues Ricciardo&#8217;s run of terrible luck at his home grand prix, where he was disqualified from second place in 2014 for breaching fuel rules.-AFP
