Residents of Daveyton, a black township in Benoni, east of Johannesburg, were in darkness for two hours between about 6pm and 8.30pm on Monday evening. They did not have electricity, which had been disrupted for reasons no-one bothered to explain to them.In Thokoza, nearly a month ago, residents took to the streets, damaging traffic lights and used burning tyres, rocks, to close off streets and therefore making it possible for free travel, in protest against the electricity black out they had suffered at the weekend.The events were hardly reported in the news media, but they have become a daily occurrence and tend to replicate themselves in most parts of the black townships in the country.On many Sundays when I say Holy Mass in Thokoza, another black township on the East Rand, south of Johannesburg, it has become a common feature to be regularly greeted by grumpy parishioners, who would pour their hearts and tears on me, complaining that they have had a cold weekend with no electricity to light up their homes and had to take cold shower in a freezing weather.Why do these depressing things happen to black people in black townships as frequently as they do? Why are they frequently happening in Thokoza and Daveyton and not as frequently affecting residents of Sandton, Cape Town and Pretoria?Today is the beginning of the ANC national policy conference. All South Africans, including residents of Thokoza and Daveyton and other millions of South Africans affected by poor service delivery are looking forward to the outcome of the conference hosted by this glorious 105 year old national organisation as it sorts out its policies and gives new life to them.The abiding hope is that the ANC will use the three days of the conference to craft, or recalibrate their policies, so that the unhappy events of darkness and lack of water affecting residents of Daveyton and Thokoza and many South Africans will be corrected.Consistent with the organisation s signature war cry of a better life for all , the expectation is that South Africans will inherit a better future not hamstrung by all forms of uncertainties, that the weekend conference will not be dominated by rhetoric, but well thought-through debates aimed at giving hope to South Africans.Even as the South Africans walk through the valley of the shadow of darkness, South Africans must continue to live in hope that, in the words of the ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe, the party must self-correct , whatever that might mean.The previous national policy conference of 2012 in Mangaung, Bloemfontein, held some promises of a better life and of self-correction. Promises were made that the newly refined policies, a host of them including those related to employment creation, structural changes and programmes of radical transformation, would bring a smile to the face of those who had been waiting long in the employment queues.The ideal of a democratic society to aggressively deal with difficulties presented by the triple challenges of unemployment, poverty and inequality, has still to beresolved.Millions of South Africans are restive. As many debate the efficacy of the new mining charter, with all the divergent views, the hard reality facing the country is that the unemployment figures in the sector are far from encouraging.While the mining industry could absorb nearly 800000 in 1987, the figure shrank to just below 500000 in 2007. Stats SA has told us that the job loss for the current year is 48000, jobs that were slashed in the fourth quarter of this year. Clearly, with jobs being lost as is the case today, the conference must be forced to bite the bullet and to look at the scary unemployment figures dispassionately and objectively. There will be no need for rhetoric. The conference must not be preoccupied by political slates, but more by pragmatism and dire unemployment reality confronting the country.How will the question of the National Development Plan, the New Growth Path and Industrial Policy be resuscitated so that even as the temptation to focus on the notion of radical economic transformation looms large at the conference, the stark reality facing the people of Thokoza and Daveyton and all South Africans is not lost.The conference takes place at the time of great internal political strife. The ANC is divided, with different factions having different perspectives on, among other things, the future leadership question.There has been a crescendo of voices within the ANC and within the tripartite alliance, calling for the resignation of President Zuma, arguing that under his leadership the organisation has been weakened.The South African Communist party, through Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande and a section of the Congress of the South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) leadership, have been calling for the president s scalp.On the other side of the coin, the ANC Women s League and ANC Youth League and a section of the MKVA supports Zuma s presidency and are willing to lay down their lives to protect Zuma from any form of vilification by those perceived to be in the enemy camp.One hopes that the ANC, as the leader of society, will find it in themselves to be more focused and worry more in this conference about South Africans who aspire to a better life.Jo Mangaliso Mdhlela is a writer and commentator JO-MANGALISO MDHLELA&nbsp;Analysis
