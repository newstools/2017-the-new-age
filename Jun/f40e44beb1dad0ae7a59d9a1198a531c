Anil Kumble has stepped down as India coach after falling out with skipper Virat Kohli, a top source in the country&#8217;s cricket board told Reuters on Tuesday.Kumble&#8217;s original contract expired with the team&#8217;s Champions Trophy campaign, but the former captain was tipped to get an extension after enjoying a successful run during his year in charge.The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) invited applications for the role last month and Kumble had re-applied for the same.The official confirmed the 46-year-old, who was put in charge last June, decided to step down after the breakdown of his relationship with Kohli.Local media has reported that Kohli found Kumble&#8217;s brand of coaching a bit too assertive and their relationship was beyond repair.The former leg-spinner, also India&#8217;s most successful bowler, led India to 12 victories from 17 tests and losing just once.He also guided India to one-day international series wins over New Zealand and England with losses coming only in a Twenty20 series against the West Indies and in last week&#8217;s Champions Trophy final, where they lost to Pakistan.Kumble is also the chairman of the International Cricket Council&#8217;s cricket committee and has stayed back in London for the world governing body&#8217;s meeting this week.He decided not to travel with the India side for a limited-overs tour to the West Indies, where they will play a five-match ODI series and a T20 game in the Caribbean starting on June 23.-Reuters
