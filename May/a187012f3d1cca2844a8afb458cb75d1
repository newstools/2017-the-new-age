THERE could come a time when Denis Onyango struggles to find space in his trophy cabinet to fit his accolades if he continues in this fashion.The latest in the Mamelodi Sundowns captain and CAF player of the year (based in Africa) is the PSL player of the month gong for April. While the Ugandan keeper is chuffed by the recognition, his main focus is on doing enough to help the Brazilians defend their PSL title.They are second on the log with 54 points with three matches to go, trailing top placed Bidvest Wits by three points. With Baroka FC to face Sundowns at the Lucas Moripe Stadium tomorrow night, Onyango urged his side to win, hoping that Wits struggles against Free State Stars in Bethlehem continue. It is good to win individual awards, but at the same time, it is good to win as a team. We are still in the race because you will never know where you will drop points.We did not expect to against Platinum Stars. Wits always struggle in Free State, Onyango said. If we get to the top, we will win the title, but it is in Wits hands. Our game against them decided the league. We gave it to them. The game against Baroka is massive for us and for them. We believe we can still win the league. Wits still have Chiefs coming up. We are not asking for favours from anyone. Everyone is fighting for their own space. If Chiefs feel like they need to let it go, then that is fine. There is Free State Stars who need points. It is up to Wits if they keep it or give it to either us or Cape Town City. We need to win our games and hope Wits drop points. mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za-Mmasekepe Matsebane
