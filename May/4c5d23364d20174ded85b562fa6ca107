Pyongyang&#8217;s state media on Thursday published their first report on the trial of ousted South Korean President Park Geun-Hye two days earlier, calling her an &#8220;arch-traitor&#8221; and &#8220;bitch&#8221;.The Rodong Sinmun newspaper, the official mouthpiece of the ruling Workers&#8217; Party, printed an inside-page report headlined &#8220;Bitch Park Geun-Hye&#8217;s shameless attitude sparks anger&#8221;.Conservative Park took a hard line against the nuclear-armed North during her time in office, earning her its enduring loathing and abuse.The official Korean Central News Agency regularly referred to her as the &#8220;witch of Chongwadae&#8221;, the South&#8217;s presidential palace known as the Blue House.Rodong Sinmun cited media reports from the South for its article, which said Park had been arrested and indicted in &#8220;a scandal of an unpredented scale&#8221;.&#8220;A pathetic-looking bitch Park Geun-Hye who has been in jail after being kicked out of the Blue House as a result of mounting public anger and people&#8217;s candlelight protests against the arch-traitor, was brought to the court by prison bus, handcuffed and wearing a prison number 503 on her chest&#8221;, it said.Park faces charges of corruption and power abuse, including accusations of taking or seeking bribes totalling 59.2 billion won ($52 million) for her friend Choi Soon-Sil or herself, most of which went to dubious, non-profit foundations which Choi controlled.Park has denied all the charges &#8212; a stance reported by the Rodong Sinmun.&#8220;South Korean news media revealed and harshly criticised the traitor&#8217;s shameless attitude, reporting that after entering with her head up and stiff, she guiltlessly staired straight at the judges when she responded to a question about her occupation, saying she had none,&#8221; it said.The North is accused of widespread human rights abuses and when leader Kim Jong-Un&#8217;s uncle was purged in December 2013 he was put before a military tribunal, sentenced to death for treason and executed within days of being dragged out of a ruling party meeting.-AFP
