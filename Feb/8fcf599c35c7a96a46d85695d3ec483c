Classes at UKZN are about to start, and we will not be able to attend lectures because Nsfas has not responded, please help us, Sanele Hadebe said. I have not received any information about my application and I live at Tut res so I don t know whether to move out and quit school or should I wait for Nsfas to reply, Agreement Nolwazi said.According to the Higher Education and Training Department, a whopping R15.2bn would be provided to Nsfas for loans and bursaries this year.LILLIAN SELAPISAlillians@thenewage.co.za
