The two men who assaulted and forced Victor Mlotshwa into a coffin have been found guilty of kidnapping, attempted murder, assault with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm and intimidation by the Middelburg Magistrates Court in Mpumalanga.Judge Segopotjo Mphahlele today handed down her judgment where she found that Theo Jackson and Willem Oosthuizen had shown the intent to deliberately harm Mlothswa and to commit murder.The Middelburg court room was packed to the brim with people intent to hear the verdict in a case which has gripped the nation since shocking video footage surfaced last year showing Mlotshwa being forced alive into a coffin.#JudgeMphahlele has found the two accused Guilty of attempted murder Justice has truly been served today! #CoffinAssault #CountryDuty IG: KaraboDiana (@KaraboDiana) August 25, 2017&#8220;The actions of the accused could have lead to the death of Mloothshwa,&#8221; said Mphahlele.The court ruled that sentencing will be handed down on 23 October.The accused had both claimed in their testimony that they had put Mlotshwa into the coffin to scare him when they allegedly found him with stolen copper cables.However, during his testimony, Mlotshwa denied stealing any copper cables and said he was taking a short cut on his way to town through the farm where the duo worked.He recently also told the court of his ordeal when the two men forced him into a coffin and also threatened to put a live snake into the coffin and pour petrol on him.Mlotshwa also said they had intimidated him not to report the matter to police and threatened to kill him if he did.However, the state had argued on behalf of the two men, who had plead not guilty, that despite them closing the coffin on Mlothshwa, there had not been any intention to kill him but to scare him after he had threatened to kill their wives and burn their crops.Theo Jackson was found guilty of defeating the ends of justice after he burnt the coffin that was used in torturing Mlotshwa after the incident.Delivering her verdict, Judge Mphahlele noted that the first witness Hannes de Beer was a very poor witness who had admitted to lying to the police.Mphahlele also said Mlotshwa&#8217;s evidence was corroborated by Denton Sithole&#8217;s testimony and dismisses claims by the defense that the two were coached on what to say and she also added that Mlotshwa&#8217;s mother came across as a truthful witness.The judge noted that in his testimony Theo Jackson &#8221; seemed to be a man who is desperately trying to remove himself from the scene,&#8221;.Outside the court, a slew of protestors led by political parties turned out to support Mlotshwa carrying posters reading &#8221; Black Lives Matter&#8221;.After delivering her verdict, the two accused appeared stressed while the packed gallery expressed a sigh of relief.-TNA Reporter
