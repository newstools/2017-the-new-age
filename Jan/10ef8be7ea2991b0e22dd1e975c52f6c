The year ended on a bad note for Mahikeng and Ditsobotla local municipalities after the two came under heavy criticism for hindering intervention efforts.The North West provincial legislature s local government and human settlements portfolio committee condemned the two municipalities after it came to light that they had frustrated an intervention team tasked to gauge the status of the two councils.The provincial government assigned an intervention team under Section 139 (1)(b) to compile and implement new general valuation rolls at municipalities that were put under administration.Failure to cooperate by those at Mahikeng and Ditsobotla local municipalities was revealed after the committee met the department of local government and traditional affairs to get close-up reports on Section 139 and Section 154 interventions at Mahikeng, Lekwa-Teemane, Ditsobotla, Madibeng, Matlosana and Ventersdorp local municipalities.The administrator for Mahikeng, Lekwa-Teemane and Ditsobotla, Willie Berker, told the committee that although progress had been registered in the other two municipalities, the provincial intervention team had been experiencing resistance from Mahikeng local municipality. This municipality has not held a special council sitting to approve the intervention process. Role players in the municipalities are not on board and we find it difficult to obtain information on building plans and new buildings, consolidations and subdivisions, rezoning and determination of date of valuation and many other issues, Berker said.Committee chairperson Motlalepula Rosho said the committee was worried that the two municipalities were putting the brakes on a process meant to ensure that the valuation process of properties in the two municipalities is concluded. This shows serious laziness by officials from the municipalities who refuse to ensure that the process is concluded timeously. The inability of the municipal officials to compile and implement the new general valuation rolls for properties has forced the department to intervene, yet they also failed to cooperate with the intervention team. This shows lack of consequence management by the leadership of the municipalities on such ill-disciplined officials, Rosho said.On municipalities such as Matlosana, Ventersdorp and Madibeng, Rosho said the committee was concerned the department was unable to say whether the reports were adopted by their respective councils. We are unable to trace whether the department ensured the municipal councils were convened and the close-up reports and its recommendations were tabled and taken through as part of an adjustment period of the integrated development plan in January for finalisation. It shows that the department is very weak on conducting oversight in municipalities, he said.A former administrator at Matlosana local municipality, Seth Ramagaga, said that the Section 139 (1) (b) intervention team together with the department of finance, economy and enterprise development as well as the national Treasury had developed a financial recovery plan and conducted work sessions on finance, governance and administration. Public participation on budget and service delivery and budget implementation was done. The municipality has also maintained a positive bank balance as it is paying off its debt with Eskom and all supply-chain management committees were trained, Ramagaga said.Madibeng local municipality administrator Kelebogile Mogamisi said that the municipality was implementing water projects accordingly and many residents were able to access the resource. We have set a coordinated water provision approach and implemented credit control measures and customer complaint measures in situations where there are water shortages, she said.On Matlosana and Madibeng local municipalities, Rosho said the committee would meet with the department and the new administration to check if proper processes on issues raised in the previous meetings with the municipality were followed. In the meeting with the municipality on its annual report, they alleged that the intervention team had put them in more debt and claimed that it had created more problems. The switching of interventions at Madibeng local municipality with the same administrator from Section 139.(1)(b) on water and sanitation before the local government elections to Section 154 after such elections is creating a serious problem because it is the responsibility of the department to support municipalities as expected, Rosho said.She said the committee was also not happy with the close-up report of Ventersdorp local municipality and there was still a need to conduct an assessment on whether there was progress registered. We requested that the department re-examine the report and rewrite it properly. Its findings must be integrated with the process of the newly established North West 405 municipality which is an incorporation of the former Ventersdorp and Tlokwe municipalities, Rosho said.She said Section 139 interventions was a source of concern and that the value for money on the overall interventions still needed to be established.ELFAS TORERAIelfast@thenewage.co.za
