India&#8217;s Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday condemned murder in the name of protecting cows, which are worshipped by the country&#8217;s majority Hindus, after a string of killings targeting Muslims and other minorities.&#8220;Killing people in the name of Gau Bhakti (cow worship) is not acceptable. This not something Mahatma Gandhi would approve,&#8221; Modi said.Modi&#8217;s comments come just days after the stabbing murder of Junaid Khan by a group of men who accused the 15-year-old Muslim and his brother of carrying beef.India has been suffering a wave of vigilante murders, with at least 10 Muslims killed by mobs since April, said rights group Amnesty International.Khan&#8217;s murder sparked protests across Indian cities, with demonstrators calling for an end to the violence under the slogan &#8220;not in my name&#8221;.Modi expressed his &#8220;pain and anguish at the current environment&#8221; in India, listing incidents of vigilante violence.&#8220;No person in this nation has the right to take the law in his or her own hands in this country. Violence has and never will solve any problem,&#8221; the prime minister said.Critics say vigilantes have been emboldened since Modi&#8217;s right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party was elected in 2014.-AFP
