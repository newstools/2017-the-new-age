The Parliament is to establish an ad hoc committee to look into the regulating funding private and public of political parties, a parliamentary statement said today.The statement said the committee would be made up of six members drawn from the ANC, two from the DA, one from the Economic Freedom Fighters and two from all other parties represented in the National Assembly.For several years since the onset of democracy in 1994, the question of party funding had remained a contentious subject, requiring a resolution. The committee will consider the model of public and private funding for political parties and the need for, and possible means of, regulating private funding in all its forms as well as investment entities owned by political parties,&#8221; a parliamentary statement said.ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu has consistently made an impassioned plea for the better and open financing of political parties so that they may perform their functions more efficiently. It is against this background that Parliament has, among others, considered the establishment of the ad hoc committee.Today he welcomed the committee&#8217;s establishment calling it a crucial step towards strengthening the country s democracy. Political parties require adequate funding in order to perform their functions and the manner and transparency of such funding is paramount in building public confidence in our political system, Mthembu said.He continued: We are confident that the work of this committee will ensure that all political parties achieve financial sustainability in a manner that is transparent, ethical, lawful and predictable. Currently political parties represented in parliament receive under R150m a year from the IEC.Previously, the Freedom Front Plus raised issues with the fact that during the past five years between 2009 and 2014, the ANC had received R604.5m while the DA received R85.5m and the FF+ R5.5m from the IEC.-TNA Reporter
