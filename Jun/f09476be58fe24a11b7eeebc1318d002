Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba, Cabinet colleague Hlengiwe Mkhize and the director-general of Home Affairs, Mkuseli Apleni, are to be summoned to appear in Parliament next week to answer questions.They will be asked about state capture and also to explain the naturalisation of members of the Gupta family.The portfolio committee also wants documentation and emails from Gigaba, which were leaked to the media.Their appearance, however, may be impacted by an EFF intention to take Gigaba to court over his decision to approve naturalisation. The committee will seek legal guidance from Parliament s legal services in this regard.In calling on the trio to be present next week, the portfolio committee is carrying out the instruction to four committees from the House Chair for Committees, Cedric Frolick, to investigate allegations on state capture.The Gupta matter was to have been discussed by the Home Affairs portfolio committee yesterday.But Apleni could not make a meeting of the portfolio committee owing to a presentation Home Affairs gave to the a select committee of the national council of provinces (NCOP).He and Home Affairs Minister Mkhize were also due to be present in the NCOP yesterday afternoon.Members of Parliament were irritated by his absence, particularly because they had received SMSs imploring them to be at the meeting early because Apleni would be there.Yesterday s portfolio committee meeting saw a clash between DA member of Parliament Haniff Hoosen and committee chairperson Lemias Mashile.Hoosen, who had written to Mashile asking that Gigaba be summoned to a portfolio committee meeting, was irritated by the latter s inclination to seek legal advice. I m concerned. Let me just say we ve agreed that they come to this meeting. My appeal to you is please not to find ways for this thing not to happen. An angry Mashile said: I m not going to allow you to push me into a hole with my eyes wide open. It s not going to happen. You must understand I have responsibilities as a chairperson. Noting concerns about the effect of the National Assembly s Rule 89 on what could be said and not be said next week, Mashile said he would approach the institution s legal services for advice.But, he said, the intention was we are having this meeting next week Tuesday .Of Gigaba s emails, he said they would not be found in Home Affairs.Those emails are with others. However once given sight of them the department could also be able to confirm if those emails are true .DENNIS CRUYWAGENnews@thenewage.co.za
