Qualifying for Europa League football will rank as an achievement for Vitoria Guimaraes in a season that they have been consistent in the Portuguese Primeira Liga. But for Bongani Zungu, such an accomplishment would constitute great success.The midfielder has sparkled for the Portuguese side and was again impressive alongside Brazilian Rafael Miranda as Guimaraes edged Nacional 2-1 at the weekend. Victory has kept Zungu s team in fifth place, joined on 47 points with fourthplaced Sporting Braga after 27 matches, but the two sides trail third-placed Sporting CP by a massive 10 points.This means Guimaraes could qualify for the Europa League, which is not as prestigious as the Uefa Champions League, yet is a credible tournament that attracts top European sides. And for Zungu, playing in the European tournament would see him join the likes of Lucas Radebe, Thulani Serero and Benni McCarthy in European football. Just five years ago, Zungu cut his teeth with National First Division side Dynamos, went on to hone his skill at University of Pretoria before he blossomed at PSL giants Mamelodi Sundowns.This was before his surprise mid-season move to the Portuguese side, where he had to overcome a recurring injury to win a regular place in the Guimaraes lineup. Testimony to his notable rise has been his three man of the match awards picked up this year so far, and it should not be long before he returns to the national team fold. Already there is talk he might extend his stay with the Portuguese league.Elsewhere, it was not a great weekend for Andile Jali, who did not make the match-day squad for Belgian side Oostende. He has continued to play second fiddle to Cameroon midfielder Sebastien Siani. Tokelo Rantie also did not make his Genclerbirligi match-day team when they lost to Karabukspor while Keagan Dolly returned from the highs of Bafana Bafana s international week to warm the bench of his Montpellier side that lost in the French premier league.Kermit Erasmus could not help his Ligue 2 team Lens as they lost 2-0 to Brest at the weekend while Kamohelo Mokotjo played for FC Twente in their 2-1 victory over Go Ahead Eagles. Bafana Bafana selectors may be forced to look to Dino Ndlovu who has netted 12 goals for Qarabag in Azerbaijan.-Kgomotso Sethusha|kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
