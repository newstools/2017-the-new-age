Ford South Africa CEO Jeff Nemeth has on Monday urged all 1.6L ford Kuga owners to take them to the nearest dealer as soon as possible. A voluntary safety recall for all Kuga&#8217;s 1.6l vehicles has been issued, Nemeth said.He said all safety recalls were limited to vehicles that were sold between 2012 to February 2014.The decision to recall the cars comes after a high level meeting was held on Friday between senior Ford executives and National Consumer Commission lawyers. It is reported that 39 incidents of vehicle catching fire were reported to ford.Ebrahim Mohamed of the National Consumer Commission said recalling Ford Kuga vehicles was in the best interest of all consumers. Recalling the vehicle is in the best interest of consumers. It is regrettable that a life has been lost. There is no monetary value that can compensate for the loss of life, Mohamed said.Several Ford Kugas have caught alight during the past few weeks and in 2015 a man was killed when his car burst into flames.Ford&#8217;s CEO said it was unfortunate that there were cars that caught fire while experiencing such problems but he emphasised that the safety of the customers was number one priority.Thirty-three-year-old Reshall Jimmy died in December 2015 when his car caught fire while on holiday in Wilderness in the Western Cape. Last week another Kuga caught alight when the engine overheated on the N12 near the Voortrekker off ramp in Alberton, fortunately the driver escaped unharmed.-Sipho Jack
