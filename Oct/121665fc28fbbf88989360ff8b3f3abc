The Democratic Alliance (DA) is accusing President Jacob Zuma of rejecting its call to declare the 16 August a commemorative day to honour the victims of the Marikana miners shooting. “Today, the DA received a flippant response from President Jacob Zuma rejecting my call to him to declare 16 August a commemorative day in honour of the 34 mineworkers who were tragically gunned down by the police in Marikana in 2012.” said the leader of the DA Mmusi Maimane.

The tragedy is annually commemorated through events in the area which are led largely by the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu). The DA had announced in August that it had written to the President requesting him to declare 16 August a commemorative day in honour of the workers. However, the DA says that the president has rejected their call which they say is about justice and remembrance of those who lost their lives.
