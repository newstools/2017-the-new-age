The Constitutional Court will on Friday deliver judgment on Parliament’s inability to institute impeachment proceedings against President Jacob Zuma. In September, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) approached the court asking that it rules Parliament’s decision not to institute an ad hoc committee to look into instituting impeachment proceedings against Zuma for violating his office was unconstitutional. In September, the court reserved judgment on the matter. The Constitutional Court ruled in March 2016, that Zuma violated his oath of office by refusing to comply with the Public Protector’s findings that he pay a portion of R246 million for upgrades at his homestead in Nkandla. The court also affirmed that Public Protector’s findings and remedial action were binding. Zuma and Parliament had previously argued that the Public Protector’s findings were mere recommendations. -TNA Reporter
