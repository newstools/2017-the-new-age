A traditional healer accused of kidnapping a local villager and locking him up inside his house, apparently for muti purposes, was still on the run from police yesterday.Mandla Ndlovu, 30, said he spent three-days inside a room at the healer s house without food. He also had bits of cloth stuffed inside his mouth and both his hands and feet were bound with a rope. Ndlovu said he escaped from the house while the suspect was away.He said he managed to untie one leg and escaped to one of the suspect s neighbours for help. He said the incident occurred after the traditional healer met him at a nearby shop and gave him money to buy him a drink.Thereafter, the suspect returned home and ordered him to bring the drink to his house. Upon arrival at the suspect s house, Ndlovu was grabbed by the healer, who tied him up and locked him inside a room.The following day, the suspect arrived with two men who told Ndlovu that his days on earth were now over.Provincial police commissioner LtGen Mondli Zuma s spokesperson Brig Leonard Hlathi confirmed that police were investigating the matter. Hlathi said the suspect had since fled from his home but police were working hard to bring him to book. Police are on a manhunt following a kidnapping incident that occurred in Vezubuhle, Hlathi said.Traditional Health Practitioners Council national organiser Sunboy Msiza said the accreditation of the suspect as a traditional healer would be thoroughly probed. We will cooperate with the police during the investigation since a real traditional healer does not attack people but heal them as per a calling from his or her ancestor. Such people are bogus traditional healers and tarnishing our hard-earned calling. The organisation cannot tolerate such behaviour which can simply be described as witchcraft and against the healing call, Msiza said.Any person with information which could lead to the arrest of the suspect has been requested to contact the Kwa-Mhlanga police on 082 922 9831, 013 947 000 or 08600 10111.FRANCE NYAKAfrancen@thenewage.co.za
