Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who has been in Spain for nearly a month, has undergone medical checks but is in good health, the ruling MPLA party said Monday.Dos Santos&#8217;s health has been subject to weeks of speculation after his daughter Isabel denied rumours that he had died while in Spain.&#8220;President dos Santos is on holiday in Spain, it is a private trip, he is in good health,&#8221; Anastacio de Brito, a spokesman for the MPLA, told AFP.&#8220;It is quite normal for him to have medical consultations and examinations there,&#8221; he added.Dos Santos, 74, has been in power since 1979 and has announced that he will not contest elections due in August, marking a historic change in the oil-rich country.He has reportedly received cancer treatment in Barcelona over several years.&#8220;In life, it happens to us all that sometimes we do not to feel good. But he is fine. He is in Spain, and when he gets better he will return,&#8221; Foreign Minister Georges Chikoti told France&#8217;s RFI radio on Monday.Joao Lourenco, the defence minister, has emerged as Dos Santos&#8217;s chosen successor and is on course to take power at the elections.-AFP
