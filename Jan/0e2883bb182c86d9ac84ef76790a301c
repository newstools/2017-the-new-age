Overland routes to Thailand&#8217;s flood-hit south were severed on Tuesday after two bridges collapsed following days of torrential rain that has killed at least 25 people, including a five-year-old girl.The heaviest January rains for three decades have lashed the country&#8217;s southern neck for more than a week, affecting 1.1 million people across eleven provinces.The unseasonal downpours have also put a dampener on Thailand&#8217;s peak tourist period, prompting cancellations on popular resort islands including Samui and Phangan.On Tuesday morning the main road heading down Thailand&#8217;s southern neck &#8212; Highway 4 &#8212; was closed in Prachuab Kiri Khan province, four hours south of Bangkok.&#8220;We stopped all vehicles from passing after two bridges collapsed on Highway 4,&#8221; a Highways Department spokesman told AFP.Trains south have also been stopped by the rising floodwaters, increasing demand on already stretched flights to and from the flood-ravaged region.The death toll has crept up over recent days as floods have reached roof-top level in some areas.A five-year-old girl in Prachuab province became the latest victim when a flash flood hit a van she was travelling in late Monday.&#8220;Her family climbed to the roof of the van to avoid the water but she fell in with her mother,&#8221; relief worker Rawiroj Thammee told AFP.&#8220;The girl was swept away&#8230; villagers found her body 200 metres from the van this morning (Tuesday).&#8221;January usually brings visitors flocking to the south&#8217;s islands and pristine beaches as monsoon rains abate and temperatures ease.But the region has been battered by what junta chief Prayut Chan-O-Cha described as the heaviest January rainfall in 30 years.Vast tracts of the south &#8212; which is also an agricultural hub for rubber, palm oil and fruit plantations &#8212; have been left under water while flash floods have caused deaths and widespread damage.Television images have shown villagers wading through muddy water in remote flooded hamlets, with a few salvaged belongings held above their heads.Soldiers have been deployed to provide relief packages and rescue stranded people in the worst-hit areas.Patients were evacuated by canoes as a hospital was swamped with waters in Prachuab province.The rain is forecast to slacken over the next 24 hours.-AFP
