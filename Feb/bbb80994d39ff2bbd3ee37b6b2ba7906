The 12-year marriage between Barclays Africa Group (trading as Absa) and London-based parent Barclays Plc has come to an end as the latter has agreed to pay R12.8bn for a divorce.In a joint statement released on Thursday by both parties, they said they had agreed on separation terms, which include black economic empowerment (BEE) contributions.The agreement is expected to unlock opportunities for Barclays Africa as an independent pan-African bank. It is a good outcome that enables us to complete the separation and to provide continuity and improved service for our customers, Maria Ramos, CEO of Barclays Africa said.Barclays Plc has submitted an application to the Reserve Bank for approval to reduce its shareholding in Barclays Africa Group to below 50%.The application, which also requires the approval of the minister of finance, includes the terms of the separation payments and transitional services arrangements, which have been agreed between the two banks.According to the parties, the expectation is that the financial contributions will neutralise the capital and cash flow impact of separation investments on Barclays Africa Group over time.An important feature of discussions has been the provision for a broad-based black economic empowerment scheme and Barclays Plc agreed to contribute an amount equivalent to 1.5% of Barclays Africa s market capitalisation, or R2.1bn based on a Barclays Africa s share price of R168.69 on December 31, 2016 towards the establishment of such a scheme.Alongside a BEE scheme, Barclays Africa also wants to create an equity proposition for its staff in the next 12 to 18 months, aiming to give its people the opportunity to benefit from share ownership. Both these schemes will help us to build an ownership-based, entrepreneurial culture that goes to the heart of our commitment to the communities which we serve, Ramos said.It is still not clear who are the frontrunners are for the remaining 50.1% stake of Barclays Africa Group, despite the fact that the Public Investment Corporations (PIC), which owns 6%, says it has no interest in increasing its stake.Barclays Plc market cap is 49.56bn (R799 trillion), about 200 times the national budget of South Africa while Absa s market cap is about R119bn, making it the third-biggest bank in SA.Barclays Plc bought South African bank Absa in 2005 to be a controlling major shareholder at 62.3% and then built it up under former CEOs John Varley and Bob Diamond, eventually acquiring its parent s operations in eight African nations, giving Barclays a presence in 12 countries on the continent with 12 million customers.Last year, Barclays Plc announced that it would slim down all under-performing global businesses including its 62.3% stake in Absa. The group since sold 12.2%, reducing its share to 50.1%.In terms of South African law, if a company owns less than 50% it s no longer a major controlling shareholder, but given the fact that Barclays Plc s stake is still sitting at 50.1%, suggests that the group is still a controlling shareholder until it finds a new buyer.Barclays Africa will be able to continue using the Barclays brand at its operations outside of South Africa for three years.Bernard Sathekge| bernards@thenewage.co.za
