We are continuing with our investigations into missing people and not only this case.We urge families to report the missing immediately so that we can trace the person. We are also appealing to anyone who knows people who are kidnapping, to report it to the police so that we can arrest such people in communities, SAPS spokesperson Kay Makhubela said.Carrim was reported missing on Thursday when he failed to return home from work and no one has seen or heard from him since.Family spokesperson Yusuf Abramjee has condemned misleading messages which are not verified and hamper police investigations.Abramjee urged the public to treat the case with sensitivity. We need to be cautious before posting and sharing information as this could hamper police investigations and even place the safety of the victim at risk.We often deal with organised crime syndicates and sensitivity is key. Let s not try to be first to share or break news at the expense of the victim, Abramjee said.MASEGO TIRO news@thenewage.co.za
