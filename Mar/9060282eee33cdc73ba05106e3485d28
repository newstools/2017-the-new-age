The home of veteran actor and musician, Joe Sdumo Mafela yesterday became a place of mourning and deep reflection as people came to offer their support following his untimely death in a car accident on Saturday night.Prominent actors who came to offer their support to the Mafela family included veterans such as Patrick Shai, Lillian Dube and Israel Makoe.Shai who spoke to The New Age briefly said the news of Mafela s death was communicated to him by a friend. On hearing the news, I rushed straight to Mafela s Soweto home, where I was told that indeed, the legendary Joe Mafela was no more. I then made my way here to mourn and offer my support to the family. The ground has literally become a museum of sorts, swallowing our legends on a daily basis, Shai said.Dube did not mince words when she said the industry did not care about its legends. We were not invited to the Saftas yet me and Joe are producers and veterans of the industry. We are not looking for handouts or money, but we want to be afforded the platform to participate in the industry, she said.Speaking on behalf of Mafela s family, Millicent Mulelu said his death was unexpected as he was preparing to go on a boat cruise with his wife yesterday. He was still excited about his recent boat cruise. Nothing could have prepared us for his death so soon after coming back from the cruise. He was the one who brought the family together and made sure every member of our family was taken care of, Mulelu said.Mafela died in a car accident on the M1 North between the Oxford and Houghton road off-ramp, JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said.SIYABONGA SITHOLE
