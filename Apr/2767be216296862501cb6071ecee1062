Madonna&#8217;s upstart career will become a new biopic, the Hollywood Reporter announced. The film, entitled &#8220;Blond Ambition,&#8221; will explore the pop icon&#8217;s early years at the turn of the 1980s.&nbsp;Madonna moved to New York from Michigan in 1978 to pursue dance, but shifted to singing and writing songs. Her eponymous debut album was released in 1983, yielding the hits &#8220;Holiday,&#8221; &#8220;Borderline,&#8221; and &#8220;Lucky Star.&#8221; Madonna&#8217;s last album, &#8220;Rebel Heart,&#8221; was released in 2015. As an article on Pitchfork from the same year stated: &#8220;Even if you aren&#8217;t a super fan-or even a fan at all-there&#8217;s no escaping Madonna. She is everywhere. It is not hyperbole to say that Madonna profoundly influenced the ways in which an entire generation of young people thought about music, fashion, and,in particular,sex. &#8230; She devised the archetype of pop stardom as we know and understand it today.&#8221; The film, picked up by Universal, was penned by Elyse Hollander, who worked as an assistant to Alejandro G. Inarritu during the production of &#8220;Birdman.&#8221; Hollander&#8217;s debut script was a top pick on the 2016 Black List &#8212; the industry ranking of Hollywood&#8217;s most-liked unproduced screenplays. Michael De Luca (&#8220;Fifty Shades of Grey&#8221;) along with Brett Ratner (&#8220;Rush Hours,&#8221; &#8220;The Revenent&#8221;) and John Zaozirny are slated to produce.-AFP
