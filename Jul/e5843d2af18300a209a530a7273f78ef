The ANC said yesterday that fee-free higher education could be implemented as early as next year.Addressing journalists in Johannesburg, ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said the governing party s national executive committee (NEC) lekgotla at the weekend resolved to introduce free higher education for first-year students in 2018. Being cognisant that the higher education commission has until August 31 to submit its report on the feasibility of fee free higher education and training, the NEC lekgotla resolved to introduce the following measures that should be integrated into the final work of the commission, Mantashe said. The proposal should be factored in over time but effective from the January 2018 intake of students. The reason for the phasing in is to allow time and space for the government to prepare and budget for it over the long term. Mantashe gave a breakdown of the prerequisites needed for students to qualify. Full grants should be provided to academically qualifying poor students whose household income is less than R150000. Students whose household income is between R150 000 and R600000 will receive a mixture of grants and loans to help substitute their fee payments. Students will have to maintain adequate academic performance and failure to do so would lead to disqualification, Mantashe said.Mantashe also denied that the ANC s decision on the matter was a knee-jerk reaction to the threat of another wave of #FeesMustFall protests next year at university colleges. The intention is to provide free education in a sustainable way to the children from poor households of the working class. This is a long standing resolution on which we made a lot of promises. We are taking a step forward now that we will pilot it and phase it in from 2018, he said.BONOLO SELEBANObonolos@thenewage.co.za
