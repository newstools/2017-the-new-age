DESPITE the group of former MK senior commanders and the ANC being on opposite ends of the pole on a call for the party s national executive committee (NEC) to step down, the parties pledged to continue working on the agreeables .MK veteran Thabang Makwetla said discussions earlier this week between the group of former MK combatants and the ANC s top six on the veterans call for the entire ANC leadership to quit had reached a dead end. The leadership express-ed their views about these matters and there are many areas that we agree on and there are areas in the proposal that were not accepted, Makwetla said. The leadership explained the difficulty of such an approach and the implications it has on preparations for the national consultative conference. However, Makwetla said the MK veterans and the ANC would continue to have ongoing engagements on other related matters emanating from the MK veterans council resolutions. We will continue to have ongoing engagements with the leadership of the ANC, he said.Makwetla s comments follow a media briefing that was convened by disgruntled MK combatants on Wednesday.The group charged that the ANC leadership had become impotent and the only effective remedy would be for the ANC NEC to be disbanded and for an interim structure to be put in place.Makwetla, making reference to discussions between the group and the leadership of the Umkhonto weSizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) on Tuesday, said a joint media briefing would be convened to share the outcomes of the meeting. We had a meeting with the MKMVA on Tuesday and we ll communicate the outcomes, he said. The meeting was very successful and we had some robust engagements. Meanwhile, a group of ANC stalwarts and veterans who are signatories to the For the Sake of Our Future document met yesterday among themselves to push forward on their call for a national consultative conference to be held before the ANC s policy conference in June.Spokesperson for the group Wally Serote said the veterans would communicate their programme of action in due course.Bonolo Selebano
