The Congress of the People( COPE) said it was not surprised nor shocked by the Cabinet reshuffle. We firmly believe that the Cabinet reshuffle announced by Mr Jacob Zuma is just a smokescreen to cover up the main destructive intention, Dennis Bloem, Cope s spokesperson said in a statement. All of us know that Zuma&#8217;s targets were Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas. He accused the president of removing the very competent, capable and hardworking individuals who had the country&#8217;s best interests at heart and replaced them with his homeboys from KwaZuluNatal, Malusi Gigaba and Sfiso Buthelezi, who are both less known in the markets and without any experience in this field. &nbsp; The Treasury is now firmly captured by the Gupta family. It is well-known that Gigaba is having a close relationship with the Guptas, Bloem said. If this reshuffle was based on performance then Bathabile Dlamini, Des van Rooyen, Faith Muthambi and Mosebenzi Zwane would have been kicked out as well because their performances had been mediocre and dismal . Bloem asked how Derek Hanekom was removed and Dlamini retained. Dlamini who is now expected to file an affidavit in the Concourt as to why she should not be held personally liable for the costs of the recent SASSA scandal. How could Zuma keep Faith Muthambi, when the National Assembly to which Zuma is accountable to, recommended that action be taken against her for the SABC fiasco, he added. The removal of Gordhan and Jonas would have very serious and negative consequences to the economy of the country . Bloem said this was a case of Zuma putting party before country. &nbsp;
