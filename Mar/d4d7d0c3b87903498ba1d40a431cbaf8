Radio personality and entrepreneur, Tbo Touch, real name Thabo Molefe, announced that he will launch the name of his revamped station with a new name, Touch HD. The digital online radio station, known as Touch Central was launched last August as a collaborative brainchild of media personalities Tbo Touch and Gareth Cliff. The aim of the station, which will officially switch to Touch HD from April 1, was “to disrupt radio as we know it”, through innovation and by being uncensored and unpredictable. The station introduced listeners to a host of undiscovered broadcast talent from across South Africa. The new platform is set to continue being a pioneer in the African digital online radio space with a stronger focus on being the go-to source for fresh content in the urban African and cosmopolitan youth market. This is by delivering the highest quality of music, current affairs, lifestyle and entertainment news from the continent. The reimagined line-up will also include some of the best talent that the continent has to offer, emphasising once again that this is not just radio, it’s a digital lifestyle. The DJ said the station would continue being available through mobile phones, online streaming, podcasting and digital audio broadcasting, with additional platforms planned at a later stage to make it more accessible. Details about the station’s upcoming changes will be divulged and the event is scheduled to take place on March 28. “The new station is being true to its roots, vision and mission of innovation and disruption through the changes being introduced. “We are excited about the new Touch HD app and the new streaming options which promise to elevate audiences interaction experience,” he said.
