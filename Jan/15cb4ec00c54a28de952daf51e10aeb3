Some good news for South African resources companies as the World Bank s report forecasts strong gains for industrial commodities such as energy and metals this year, due to tightening supply and strengthening demand.The World Bank s Commodity Markets Outlook is published quarterly, with the report providing detailed market analysis for major commodity groups, including energy, metals, agriculture, precious metals and fertilisers.In the past, the decline in commodity prices has severely hurt the South African resources companies, including the overall domestic economy.The situation has led to a number of companies retrenching workers especially in the mining industry as the global slump in commodity prices and weak demand, particularly from China, hit South Africa very hard. However, the latest World Bank report indicates industrial commodity prices are likely to surge this year.The report says the Bank is forecasting strong gains for industrial commodities such as energy and metals this year, due to tightening supply and strengthening demand. In its January 2017 Outlook, the World Bank is holding steady its crude oil price forecast for the year at $55 (R730) per barrel, a 29% jump from last year.The energy price forecast assumes members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers will partially comply with an agreement to limit production after a long period of unrestrained output.The Bank is raising its metals price forecast to an increase of 11% from the 4% rise anticipated in its October outlook on further tightening of supply and strong demand from China and advanced economies. Prices for most commodities appear to have bottomed out last year and we are on track to climb in 2017. However, changes in policies could alter this path, John Baffes, senior economist and lead author of the report said. Agriculture prices, as a whole, are expected to rise by less than 1% in 2017.Small increases are anticipated for oils and oil seeds and raw materials but grains prices are forecast to drop almost 3% on an improved supply outlook. Precious metals prices are seen declining 7% as benchmark interest rates rise and safe-haven buying slows.A Special Focus shows how commodity-exporting, emerging and developing economies have been hit hard by slowing investment growth, which has declined from 7.1% in 2010 to 1.6% in 2015. Ayhan Kose, director of the World Bank s Development Prospects Group, said investment weakness, both public and private, hinders a range of activity in commodity-exporting, emerging market and developing economies. Most of these economies have limited policy space to counteract the slowdown in investment growth, so they need to employ measures to enhance the business environment, promote economic diversification, and improve governance to better growth prospects over the long term. &nbsp;TNA Reporter| business@thenewage.co.za
