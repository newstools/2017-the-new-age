Jurgen Klopp believes Liverpool&#8217;s 4-0 rout of West Ham proves they can cope with the pressure of fighting for Champions League qualification, but he warned his stars to guard against complacency.Liverpool&#8217;s destiny is in their own hands after a dominant display at the London Stadium and victory over relegated Middlesbrough next Sunday will secure a top four finish in the Premier League.If Arsenal drop points against Sunderland on Tuesday, Liverpool will make it back into Europe&#8217;s elite club competition before the last weekend of the season.&#8220;Part of our life is to handle pressure, to ignore the bad part of pressure and to use the good part of pressure,&#8221; Klopp said.&#8221;We drew in the last game with Southampton, we didn&#8217;t score with a penalty and maybe people say then: &#8216;They can&#8217;t deal with pressure.&#8217;&#8220;I thought we saw really a convincing performance with no doubts about anything.&#8221;But the first sentence the players said in the dressing room was: &#8216;One more time. One more game.&#8217; &#8220;We will stay focused 100 per cent, we know about the difficulty of the next game, nobody will go into this game and underestimate it one per cent.&#8221;Liverpool will be heavy favourites to beat Middlesbrough, but Klopp warned his players to stay focused.&#8221;Middlesbrough have had a hard season, and it&#8217;s hard in a season like this to enjoy football,&#8221; he said.&#8221;I&#8217;m pretty sure they&#8217;ll want to enjoy football at Anfield, they&#8217;ll want to try anything and that makes life difficult for us.&#8220;If we can be as focused as today and as fluent and have as good movements as today, then it will be difficult for them.&#8221; Decisive area Klopp hailed man-of-the-match Philippe Coutinho, who scored twice and created Daniel Sturridge&#8217;s opening goal.Divock Origi added the fourth goal but it was Coutinho who drew Klopp&#8217;s most fulsome praise.Often lost stationed out on the wing, Coutinho flourished at the tip of the diamond and he has now scored six goals in the last seven games.&#8221;He was never a winger, he&#8217;s always kind of a playmaker, it&#8217;s not interesting where he&#8217;s coming from, he needs to be at one point, in the decisive area in the middle of the park,&#8221; Klopp said.&#8220;He needs to be in shooting situations and finishing situations, that&#8217;s what he did today. Obviously he did really well in this position.&#8221;Sturridge was another to shine, scoring his first goal since January 2 after an injury-hit season.West Ham want to sign the England striker, but Klopp said: &#8220;He gives us options. His paced troubles teams and I thought his timing was brilliant.&#8221;West Ham ended Tottenham&#8217;s title tilt in their previous match, but there was never a chance of derailing Liverpool&#8217;s European bid.&#8220;I wanted the same performance as against Spurs or similar,&#8221; Hammers manager Slaven Bilic said.&#8221;We didn t do it. We have to be honest about it. We were without a few players but also against Spurs.&#8221;We wanted to avoid complacency but it was obviously there at least subconsciously.&#8220;They were better, we were nowhere near close enough. If you give time and space to players like Coutinho, Sturridge and Lallana they will kill you.&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what happened. If you put that on a performance that was not good enough, it usually ends like this.&#8221;-AFP
