Travis Graham may be one of the youngest captains in the PSL, but the responsibilities of the armband have never been lost on the Ajax Cape Town leader.Very little could have prepared the 23 year old for the challenges he inherited since assuming the position last season.However, having survived the pressures of this season so far, Graham could safely say he has grown into the role.He even speaks with authority and exudes confidence of a battle-hardened veteran, belying his tender age. The mid pre-season has been good, the guys needed a break as well I think. We are back again, working hard.Coach Stanley Menzo has been looking at our fitness, making sure that we are up to par, everything is going smoothly, the boys look fit and we are prepared for the Bidvest Wits game, Graham said.The Urban Warriors return to PSL action when they visit Wits at Milpark tonight, looking to pick up where they left off in December.An impressive run of five wins in six matches catapulted them from the relegation zone and into a safer mid-table spot.But more work lies ahead if the Cape side are to steer clear of relegation and successfully pursue top-eight qualification. Knowing coach Gavin Hunt and the team he has at his disposal, it is going to be a difficult game. They are going to go all in and we will have to match that.For us playing away, it is important that we try and at least get a draw, if we get a chance to win it, we must make sure we don t let it slip, three points would be the best outcome. Like the rest of the teams, the Urban Warriors have strengthened their team, bringing back Ajax product Sameehg Doutie and two Zambians, Rodrick Kabwe and Aubrey Funga. Sameehg has been here before so he is quite used to the system, especially with coach Stanley now in charge. He also knows most of the guys, from academy days.It is good to have him back, he has had a good football experience as an individual, especially playing in India. The two Zambian guys bring with them a lot of potential, they are very skilful and I am sure they will do well.Rheece Evans is very solid, he brings a lot to the team and hopefully we can use that experience to benefit the squad as a whole.
