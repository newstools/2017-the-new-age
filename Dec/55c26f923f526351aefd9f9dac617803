The ANC provincial Chairperson in Mpumalanga, David Mabuza says there are comrades in the organisation who want to hold on to power at all cost. “We are different, there are people who want positions at all costs. There are people who carry the movement and they worry when the movement dies. “The ANC is more important than who’s going to lead and will support whoever is going to take charge of the organisation.” Mabuza said this on Friday, at the party’s Special Provincial General Council (PGC) held in Mpumalanga. The province is expected to announce its preferred leadership through its branch nominations leading up to the 54th National Elective Conference, which will be held on the 16- 20 of December at Nasrec Expo Centre. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Free State province endorsed former African Union Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma as the preferred party president, David Mabuza as her deputy, Ace Magashule Secretary General, Deputy Jessie Duarte, Treasure Maite Nkoana Mashabane and National chairperson Nathi Mthethwa. Today’s PGC is watched closely by both Cyril Ramaphosa and Nkosazana Dlamini’s camps. Mpumalanga is seen as deciding province for both. ANC National Chairperson Baleka Mbethe is expected to address Frida’s PGC. Watch the full video of his speech below  -Sipho Jack
