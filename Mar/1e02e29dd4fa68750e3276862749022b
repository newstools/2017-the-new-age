The DA has announced that it will table a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma due to his intention to remove Pravin Gordhan and his Deputy, Mcebisi Jonas from his cabinet.Earlier on Thursday SACP Deputy General Secretary Solly Mapaila confirmed rumours of a possible cabinet reshuffle saying that Zuma had consulted the SACP on axing the two Ministers.According to the SACP Zuma told them of an intelligence report which claims the two ministers had been mobilising internationally to oust him.&#8221; Zuma has threatened our economy by dangling the possibility of firing Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, and his Deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, before the country, and before the world, by using a bizarre and seemingly last minute security report to justify such removals,&#8221; DA leader Mmusi Maimane said.&#8220;This is nothing more than an attempt at total state capture and cannot be accepted,&#8221; said Maimane.Maimane says the DA has written to Speaker of the National Assembly, Baleka Mbete, indicating their intention to have their motion debated and voted on by Parliament.The DA, however, is no stranger to raising motions of no confidence only to have it shot down by the ruling party.Last year the party s motion of no confidence, following the release of the State Capture report, failed when the ANC s parliamentary caucus united to overwhelmingly defeat the motion by 214 votes to 126.Another motion brought in March last year was also defeated by the ANC 225 to 99.ANC MPs have repeatedly dismissed the DA&#8217;s motions as frivolous. In 2015 a similar motion was predictably defeated by an ANC majority when a total of 221 members voted against it and 113 were in favour.The ANC in 2012 blocked then DA Parliamentary leader Lindiwe Mazibuko&#8217;s motion altogether from being debated in the national Assembly.Meanwhile, opposition party the Economic Freedom Fighters has announced it will bring an application to the Constitutional Court to order Parliament s speaker to start impeachment proceedings against President Jacob Zuma.-TNA Reporter
