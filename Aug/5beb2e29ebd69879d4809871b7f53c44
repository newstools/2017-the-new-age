The latest leaks of iPhone8 confirm that Apple has supersized the upcoming flagship and is expected to be the company s biggest smartphone launch.The leaked dummy units suggest that Apple has added 1.1-inch, which is a big jump from iPhone7 s 4.7-inch display taking the new phone to 5.8-inches. The screen was uncovered by developer Steve Troughton-Smith. These are the metrics used by the status bar on the edge-toedge iPhone, including notch height and ear width. Designers, have fun, Troughton-Smith tweeted. A popular, Chinese microblogging site, Weibo, suggests the phone will come in three colours, white, jet black, and a new colour described as a champagne gold .It s been mentioned that iPhone8 s front-facing camera modules will be supplied by LG Innotek. It is worth adding that the company already supplies dual rear camera modules for the iPhone7 Plus. The report says that the 3D facial recognition system will work better than the 2D recognition system, which is there in Samsung s Galaxy S8. The new iPhone might come equipped with 3D facial recognition sensors, a feature that would serve not only to unlock the device, but also to validate Apple Pay and App Store purchases.Besides a 3D front-facing camera, there have been previous reports that talk about the iPhone8 s 3D-sensing technology. The iPhone8 (also rumoured to be called iPhone Edition ) could also feature augmented reality (AR) features. The Touch ID functionality may be rendered obsolete or placed beneath the screen, something that is technically quite difficult to achieve. What we know from the leaks: The phone is set to be called iPhone8 or iPhone Edition It has a vertical dual-lens rear camera Its display is said to be to be 5.8-inches Set to launch in September It is the biggest redesign in iPhone history. -INDIE BOYCE|indieb@thenewage.co.za
