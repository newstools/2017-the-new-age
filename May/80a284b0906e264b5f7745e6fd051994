Domestic business confidence improved slightly last month by 1.1 index points to 94.9, from 93.8 in March 2017, but latest political developments and policy uncertainty posed a serious threat going forward.At the same time, the Standard Bank Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), also released yesterday compiled by Markit, edged lower to 50.3 from 50.7 in March, contracting for the first time in nine months as new export orders continued to decline and growth remained marginal.According to the South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Sacci) which published the BCI, said the April 2017 BCI data contains sub-indices that instantly reacted to events at the end of March into April pertaining to political developments, policy uncertainty and lower credit ratings.However, nine of the 13 sub-indices making up the BCI were still affected by the business climate prior to the referred events, and positive developments in the economy therefore still informed the business climate in April 2017 and were vibrant enough to carry the positive business climate forward last month.As a result, the April 2017 BCI is 0.6 index points lower than in April 2016.However, Sacci said the stronger rand exchange rate and lower inflation made positive year on year contributions to the BCI. Less merchandise import volumes, higher energy costs and lower share prices than a year ago contributed to the less favourable business climate in April 2017 than in April 2016.Sacci said the challenge for growth starts with fixed investment and foreign direct investment (FDI) to augment South Africa s dismal savings rate and thus business and investor confidence are essential.At the same time, although the Standard Bank s PMI, remained above the 50 mark dividing expansion from contraction for the eighth month in a row, the majority of sub-indexes showed a decline. The output index fell to 49.6 after remaining above 50 since September 2016, primarily due to slow sales, economic and political uncertainty, Thandie Sithole, Standard Bank economist said.She said new export orders remained in contractional territory signalling uncertainty and weak confidence.South Africa s economic outlook has been further clouded by credit rating downgrades to junk by two of the three major rating agencies following President Jacob Zuma s decision in late March to fire finance minister Pravin Gordhan.A fall below investment-grade typically constricts funding and sharply raises borrowing costs. South Africa s Central Bank warned on Tuesday that further downgrades would have a significant impact on the cost of funding and investment flows, restraining already dismal growth prospects.
