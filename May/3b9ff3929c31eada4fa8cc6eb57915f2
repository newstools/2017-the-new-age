The Public Protector has been asked to probe alleged birthday party donations to two DA MEC s.The ANC in the Western Cape has on Monday laid two separate but related complaints with the Public Protector.They have requested an urgent investigation into the seemingly illegal and irregular contributions made by service providers and contractors to birthday parties of various provincial ministers.This is after reports say contractors and service providers, supplying services and products to various government departments, made financial contributions to birthday parties of Bonginkosi Madikizela the Human Settlements MEC and that of Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo in 2016.ANC Western Cape Secretary Faiez Jacobs said the party demanded answers.&#8220;It is unclear at the moment if these were the only two provincial ministers who accepted donations from service providers and contractors for birthday parties or celebrations and it is only an independent investigation by a credible and independent constitutional institution that can provide the necessary answers,&#8221; said Jacobs.Madikizela acting DA provincial leader says it was just a surprise party paid for by friends.It is reported that Madikizela s friends including directors of construction companies trading with his department treated him to the party.In an interview with Sunday Times Phumla Zantsi, partner at Lawula Trading and Construction, said she made financial contributions from her personal account owing to her friendship with the human settlements MEC that dated back to 1998.Although Zantsi confirmed the company does business with the Western Cape government, including projects with the department of human settlements. She said as friends they contribute money for each other. I had to contribute from my pocket. I paid for the cake, for about R3 000. I don t involve my company in these things,&#8221; said Zantsi.&#8220;We trust that the Public Protector would priorities this matter as the citizens of the Western Cape deserve full disclosure on these payments and contributions, its extent and scope and all those involved in the potentially criminal conduct of all involved,&#8221; concluded Jacobs.TNA Reporter
