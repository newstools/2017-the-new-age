A study to evaluate a new antiretroviral drug combination for the treatment of HIV was launched yesterday by the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute (RHI) together with its partners.The Advance study aims at generating evidence to replace the first line HIV treatment with a single fixed dose.The dolutegravir (DTG) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) based regimen has already been hailed as a potential game changer in the treatment of HIV due to its safety and its cost-cutting potential.If successful this could mean safer, tolerable and cheaper drugs, which could help SA save on its ARV spend.According to researchers the DGT/TAF regimen has demonstrated increased robustness, safety and better patient tolerability.The RHI s deputy director, Prof Francois Venter, said: If successful, patients will benefit from a much safer and more forgiving drug regimen in a smaller tablet. According to the institute, a switch to the DGT/TAF regimen could see SA treat all people living with HIV by 2019 with its current ARV budget. A total of 1100 people are expected to take part in the study at three research sites in the Johannesburg CBD.There are about 6.75 million people infected with HIV in the country, with more than 1000 people diagnosed with HIV every day and 3.3 million on ARV treatment.SA has the largest ARV treatment programme in the world having recently adopted the Test and Treat policy as per the guidelines of the World Health Organisation.The study is funded by the US Agency for International Development and Unitad through Optimise, a global partnership working to accelerate access to simpler, safer and affordable HIV treatment.LERATO DIALEleratod@thenewage.co.za
