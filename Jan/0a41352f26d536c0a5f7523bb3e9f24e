With teachers calling for education MEC Ishmael Kgetjepe to be fired over the failure to deliver stationery to schools on time, Premier Stan Mathabatha will lead a team of his executive members to assess the situation in schools today before taking any action.Thousands of teachers under the South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu), backed by student body Congress of South African Students (Cosas) as well as the National Health Education and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) protested outside Mathabatha s office on Thursday calling for Kgetjepe s head and the immediate delivery of stationery.Protesting teachers gave the department of education seven days to respond and 14 days to implement their demands, which included payment of outstanding monies to their members.In a subsequent response, the premier s office said while it had noted progress in the delivery of stationery to schools it was, however, concerned that some schools were yet to receive stationery. This is the embarrassing and mostly unacceptable situation we find ourselves in as the provincial government. We would like to take this opportunity to apologise to pupils, teachers and the entire population of this province. We would like to assure people that we are managing to put the situation under control, provincial government spokesperson Phuti Seloba said. We are also confident that those who contributed to this unfortunate situation will never forget the consequences of their actions or lack of it for generations to come. He said the aim of the visits to several schools today was not only to check on progress made on the delivery of stationery and textbooks but also to help in dealing with any form of challenge that might be experienced in the education sector.Amid fierce condemnation from opposition parties and teachers unions over the stationery saga, the provincial education department said it would ensure that all schools in the province received their consignments of stationery and other learning and teaching material by today.In another development, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga will visit schools in Vuwani today and schools around Lebowakgomo tomorrow. The visit comes after the extraordinary effort of the class of 2016 who achieved sterling results in the face of grave unrest in the Vuwani area leading up to the examinations, department of basic education spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said.montshom@thenewage.co.za
