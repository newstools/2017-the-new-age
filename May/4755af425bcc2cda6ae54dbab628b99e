The body of a male initiate who died while undergoing a circumcision ritual is being kept at the state morgue in Kwamhlanga Hospital for post-mortem purposes.This brings the number of initiates who died after being admitted to initiation schools in the province to eight so far this season. Sources said the latest victim, aged 16 to 18, was transported to the mortuary on Sunday from an initiation school in Sybrandskraal.The exact cause of death was still unclear yesterday, although it was suspected it might be related to the circumcision process. We had to watch in shock as another body of an initiate was being transported to the government mortuary. The boy died while at the initiation school and it is still unknown about the real circumstances which led to his death, a source said.Provincial health MEC Gillion Mashego s spokesperson Dumisani Malamule confirmed the initiate s death. We can indeed confirm that there is an initiate who was brought to the mortuary after he died at the initiation school. For now, we are not in a position to disclose the cause of death since an autopsy still has to be conducted, Malamule said.He said the department was concerned about the deaths of people during circumcision rituals. As the department, we are worried due to the increasing number of deaths happening at initiation schools across the province but we are working hard with our stakeholders like the house of traditional leaders in the province and the Ingoma Forum to prevent such loss of lives. We once again send our condolences to the grieving family. Last week, three bodies of female initiates were transferred to the same state mortuary to determine the precise causes of their deaths. They died while at an initiation school in Ramaphosa Section in Moteti.FRANCE NYAKAfrancen@thenewage.co.za
