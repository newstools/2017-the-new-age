Far-right leader Marine Le Pen could win the forthcoming presidential election in France, President Francois Hollande warned on Monday, vowing to &#8220;do everything&#8221; in his power to stop it happening.Polls suggest that Le Pen, leader of the National Front (FN), is likely to win the first round of France&#8217;s election on April 23.However, surveys also show she would then lose in the deciding second-round run-off on May 7 either to the centrist and pro-business Emmanuel Macron or conservative candidate Francois Fillon.But with Fillon&#8217;s campaign in turmoil over accusations he paid his wife for a fake parliamentary job from public funds, analysts have warned that the election is extremely difficult to predict.&#8220;There is a threat&#8221; of Le Pen winning the election, Hollande acknowledged in comments to French daily Le Monde &#8212; part of an interview with six European papers.&#8220;The far-right has not been so high (in the polls) for more than 30 years but France will not give in,&#8221; vowed the president.France &#8220;is aware that the vote on April 23 and May 7 will determine not only the fate of our country but also the future of the European project itself,&#8221; he added.Le Pen has vowed to ditch the euro as France&#8217;s currency if elected and hold a referendum on the country&#8217;s membership of the European Union.Hollande, who has battled stubbornly high unemployment throughout his five-year term and has suffered low poll ratings, decided last year not to run for a second term.He said it was his &#8220;last duty&#8230; to do everything to ensure that France is not convinced by such a plan&#8221; of taking the country out of the EU.
