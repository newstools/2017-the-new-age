The Netherlands&#8217; Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Tuesday said that Turkish sanctions against the Dutch government in the wake of a diplomatic clash were &#8220;not too bad&#8221; but were inappropriate as the Dutch have more to be angry about.The sanctions include freezing all diplomatic communication but no economic measures.&#8220;On the other hand, I continue to find it bizarre that in Turkey they&#8217;re talking about sanctions when you see that we have reasons to be very angy about what happened this weekend.&#8221;On Saturday the Netherlands blocked Turkey&#8217;s foreign minister from landing on Dutch soil and later ordered the family affairs minister to leave after she tried to get to Rotterdam to address a crowd of President Tayyip Erdogan&#8217;s supporters.Rutte&#8217;s government was angered by Erdogan referring to the Dutch as &#8220;Nazis&#8221; and for his determination to hold a campaign rally for an April referendum on Saturday among Dutch Turks on Dutch soil without a permit.The Dutch are voting in their own national election on Wednesday.-Reuters
