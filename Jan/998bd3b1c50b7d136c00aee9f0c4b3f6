FAST bowler Lungi Ngidi has already given cricket fans a glimpse of what the future holds with an eye-catching performance in the first two T20 internationals against Sri Lanka.And Proteas stand-in T20 captain Farhaan Behardien believes if the 20 year old is managed well, he will soon represent the country in all formats of the game.Ngidi started his international career by taking two wickets in the first T20 against Sri Lanka on Friday in Centurion and had supporters chanting his name. His efforts were further rewarded when he was named in the ODI squad to play Sri Lanka.Ngidi then promptly took four wickets to finish with figures of 4/49 in the second T20 on Sunday, despite the Proteas losing the match.Behardien feels the future looks bright for the 20 year old but said he should not be rushed or put under unnecessary pressure. I think a superstar has been born, Behardien said. I don t want to put too much pressure on him, he is only 20, but if he keeps his feet on the ground he will have a long career. Ngidi bowled out of his skin with good pace and bounce. Even on a slowish wicket, he got the breakthroughs for us. He took three wickets in his first few overs and a breakthrough in his fourth over, he was somebody who we could turn to, I m really pleased for him. He has been the stand-out bowler in his first two T20 internationals. If managed properly and looked after, there is a big chance that he will play in every format for South Africa. Ngidi, who is the leading wicket-taker in the series with six scalps, will be leading the attack tomorrow in the series decider against Sri Lanka at Newlands in Cape Town.NEVILLE KHOZAnevillek@thenewage.co.za
