Outgoing African National Congress (ANC) Treasurer-General Zweli Mkhize has on Sunday said that for South Africa’s economy to pick up, the relationship between government and private sector needs to be tightened. Mkhize said this while addressing delegates at the ANC Business Forum Breakfast in Nasrec, Johannesburg. “Major issues in terms of the economy include determining how to bring in more investment and creating cross-sector synergy,” he said. Mkhize added that debates have to be about how as the government take the economy forward. The area of small business development requires a great deal of creativity. He also indicated that there is a need for business people to share in terms of skills. “We need to talk about patterns of investment, in order to know where one get owners who will grow the economy as rural areas require a lot of investment. “We would like to see more inclusivity of black business in the economy. Growth must also be on a broader base.” Watch full briefing here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5PJ3SFV29c -TNA Reporter
