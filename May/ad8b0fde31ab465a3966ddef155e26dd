The community of Loeriesfontein in the Namakwa area has been urged to join hands in the fight against alcohol and drug abuse.A collaboration between the Loeriesfontein wind farm, Khobab wind farm, SAPS and social development department saw the establishment of a community substance abuse prevention programme.Khobab wind farm project manager Kevin Foster said the initiative was part of socio-economic development which was partially funded by a German company to eradicate substance abuse.Foster said the project would encompass elements of counselling and support for both substance abuse victims and their immediate families, an outreach and prevention programme at local schools as well as organisations. In addition to providing immediate relief to the community, the programme is designed to be financially sustainable and ensure long term support for the community, Foster said. The initial programme will be rolled out over a three-year period but within this time frame we will offer support and tools to create a sustainable community organisation. He said it was important that the farm came on board to rescue the lives of young people in the area as they are the leaders of tomorrow. The programme has come about following an independent social research study that identified youth boredom as the leading cause of teenage pregnancy, substance abuse and petty crime. The study says that because of its remote location and stagnant economy, the town of Loeriesfontein does not offer much for young adults in the form of employment opportunities or constructive recreational facilities. Foster said the lack of tertiary schooling in the Hantam area also plays a critical role in the situation of the area.He said even the Namakwa district municipality plans outlined that alcohol was a serious concern in the area.Meanwhile, Loeriesfontein wind farm project manager Christo Loots said the situation could be managed if all stakeholders come on board to find lasting solutions. A multi-pronged approach will include other things such as a school s improvement programme specifically focusing on the bottle necks in the education pipeline and mostly the support of local sports, arts and cultural initiatives to serve as a diversionary programme for the bored youth, Loots said.Recently, Namakwa mayor Bentley Vaas donated R30000 to the community policing forum in the area to help fight crime. He said the funds would help all the local municipalities in the district to fight crime.Vaas said it was every community member s responsibility to ensure that there was safety in the environment and all stakeholders needed to work together with the police to report elements of crime in all corners of the district and province.He said the donation was to help the community policing forum to partner with the police more effectively in the fight against crime.The call by President Jacob Zuma to build a rehabilitation centre in the province was well on track, as the government is constructing the facility.Zuma said the government was working around the clock to ensure that they curbed social ills across the country especially in the Northern Cape.Defence and Military Veterans Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula said on top of the existing seven public treatment facilities, two more would be built in the Free State and Northern Cape. The government has further developed a treatment model to ensure quality and easy delivery of treatment services, there are education and awareness raising campaigns being conducted around the country, Mapisa-Nqakula said.Zuma said the government was working with society to fight the social ills that continue to separate communities.TIISETSO MANOKOtiisetsom@thenewage.co.za
