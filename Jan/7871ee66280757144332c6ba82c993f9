A lawyer for The Gambia&#8217;s president has filed an injunction asking the Supreme Court to bar the swearing in of the president-elect this month, as Yahya Jammeh battles on in his attempt to annul his election defeat.The strongman of 22 years initially acknowledged opponent Adama Barrow as winner of the December 1 presidential polls but later backtracked and lodged a legal case to trigger new elections.&#8220;Barrister Edward Gomez has filed an injunction asking the Supreme Court to grant order barring the swearing in of President-elect Adama Barrow. He filed this document few minutes close to 6:00 pm,&#8221; a judicial source told AFP late Thursday.The lawyer asked the court to prevent Barrow&#8217;s planned inauguration for January 19 until the legal case had been settled, according to a document seen by AFP.But the Gambia&#8217;s chief Supreme Court justice said this week the challenge could not be heard for several months as it did not have a full bench, and the extra judges needed to hear the case were not available.The Gambia relies on foreign judges, notably from Nigeria, to staff its courts due to a lack of trained professionals in the tiny West African state.In response to the injunction request, Barrow&#8217;s office said in a statement that Jammeh could not exceed his five-year mandate, which expires on January 18.&#8220;The winner should prepare for inauguration while the loser prepares for Court. This is the fact that no Gambian should deny,&#8221; the statement said.Meanwhile, lawmakers in Nigeria said their president should consider giving asylum to Jammeh as a way of ending the political crisis in The Gambia.A motion passed in parliament&#8217;s lower chamber on Thursday gave members&#8217; backing to regional efforts to resolve the dispute.The MPs said &#8220;the clock is ticking fast&#8221; for The Gambia and there was a need to step up diplomacy, as the possibility of violence and mass displacement threatened West African stability.Nigeria&#8217;s President Muhammadu Buhari, who is leading the regional diplomatic transition effort, should &#8220;extend Nigeria&#8217;s readiness to offer&#8230; Jammeh safe haven in Nigeria to live securely as a way of ending the political stalemate&#8221;, they said.There was no immediate response from Buhari, who is expected to travel to Banjul on Friday for talks.Nigerian Foreign Minister Geoffrey Onyeama said Tuesday that &#8220;violence should be avoided but nothing is ruled out&#8221; by regional bloc ECOWAS to ensure The Gambia&#8217;s constitution was upheld.Jammeh on Tuesday also warned the international community against interfering in the country&#8217;s political crisis.In an address broadcast on state-run television he lashed out at &#8220;an unprecedented level of foreign interference in our elections and internal affairs and also a sustained smear campaign, propaganda and misinformation&#8221;.-AFP
