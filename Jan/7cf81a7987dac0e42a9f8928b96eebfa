To be in business in 2017 owners will need to embrace all that is the Internet of ThingsSage, the market leader in Cloud accounting software, has predicted that chatbots, collective intelligence and Blockchain are some of the big technology trends that will change the way entrepreneurs run their businesses in 2017.Sage chief technology officer Klaus-Michael Vogelberg says: As every business is transforming into a tech-enabled business, today s entrepreneurs should be on the lookout for the opportunities these technological developments can bring. Vogelberg sees six major trends for 2017 and beyond:Trend 1: Chatbots and autonomous interfacesAutonomous interfaces such as chatbots or digital agents will become increasingly common on different devices and user interfaces which entrepreneurs use to manage and control their businesses.These interfaces will dramatically change the way that humans and computers work and interact with each other.People will start talking to and with their systems or using gesture control such as hand, head or eye gestures. The user experience will not only become more convenient but also more enjoyable these systems will work autonomously and have self-learning capabilities. Eventually, software could act without user intervention, or ask a certain question only once and use this information for all further activities.Trend 2: Artificial and collective intelligenceWith mushrooming data volumes being generated by all sorts of sensors and devices on the one hand (see trend 6), and computer power and special analysis software and intelligent agents becoming increasingly affordable and powerful on the other, companies need to find ways to extract knowledge from big data.Vogelberg advises SMEs to team up. Share, for example, computer power and data with other companies in a structured and systematic manner, and profit from a better and larger data pool and superior data intelligence. Similar to crowdsourcing mechanisms, this enriched data pool would enable companies to better understand how customers behave, what they need, what to offer them and the business areas to invest in. Trend 3: Blockchain or how to create trust in the digital ageAccording to Sage, business builders should also carefully analyse if, and how, the new blockchain technology could impact their business models.Particularly all those industries which work as intermediaries between two parties such as lawyers, notaries, or real-estate or financial brokers could be affected by this, innovativeapproach.Bookkeepers and accountants might also be affected in the way they do business in the future, as Blockchain has the potential to eliminate a significant part of the workload such as checking and booking transactions, transferring money or paying invoices handled by these professions today.Trend 4: Revolutionising the movement of moneyThe way people use money and transfer their payments from one account to another has already changed dramatically: at the front end, in-app payment solutions enable users to effortlessly make one-click payments and purchase goods via mobile devices or websites.This functionality is already available in many apps today. But at the backend, systems such as accounting software are less user-friendly and not as well integrated.For example, companies have almost no possibility to make one-click invoice payments or easily manage their financial transactions between partners, suppliers and their bank with a fingertip.In 2017, more and more new solutions will allow companies to establish an end-to-end payments value chain with their suppliers and customers.These new solutions enable ubiquitous anytime anywhere, immediate and omni-channel payments and will be integrated into the financial accounting systems of tomorrow s enterprises. All parties, such as e-commerce platforms, banks, fin-techs or partners, will profit from open API standards which will be used for creating new services and enable seamless, fully-automated processing of payments and financial transactions.Trend 5: Platform-based infrastructure:In 2017, more and more SMEs will replace their stand-alone, on-site software systems with integrated, cloud-based software solutions that operate on global cloud platforms such as Salesforce.com who are offering their users access to a wealth of business apps and integrated services.Moreover, companies will benefit from mobile-app platforms such as the one operated by the Apple Mobility Partner Programme. The big benefit of these platforms is that they give even smaller companies access to innovative business software solutions and services which these companies would not have been able to afford five years ago. To some extent, these types of cloud platforms are democratising the way in which companies gain access to state-of-the-art apps and smart and scalable technologies, Vogelberg says. They allow business builders to discover new ways of working and give them the infrastructure needed to receive every kind of data from partners or the Internet of Things, analyse it, and then in a citizen developer style create something newand productive, he says.Trend 6: Internet of Things will create new services and job profiles:Small and medium-sized enterprises should be on the lookout for new possibilities that emerge with the realisation of the Internet of Things. Multiple data streams originating from sensors built into eg machines, cars, mobile and immobile goods, clothes or even human beings (eg for medical monitoring purposes) will result in a true treasure trove of data, thus creating a range of new services.SMEs should think about how to use these data streams to grow their business: Mechanics will develop new services such as predictive maintenance for technical infrastructures. Logistic companies will optimise their truck fleets by using traffic data from many different sources. Concierge services will develop surveillance services with the realisation of new smart-home technology. Retail companies might connect to smart-home devices such as refrigerators or Amazon-style dash buttons to supply customers automatically. Mobile medical care services will innovate with new devices to improve their support of elderly people living alone. In 2017, every business will need to start thinking of itself as a technology business. To stay competitive, they will need to grasp the opportunities that this development brings with it and change almost every aspect of today s more or less traditional ways of working.The good news is that business admin could become invisible, as easy as messaging a friend, or even automated, as machines learn like humans. This will empower entrepreneurs to stay focused on building their businesses. business@thenewage.co.zaTNA Reporter
