With sufficient rain to sustain farming and end the drought, the festive season was a joyous celebration for residents of Senekal, but not for 74-year-old Malerato Masilo.Between the drought that almost left the small town with no water and the rains that fell in December, Masilo is not certain what calls for a celebration in her case.The elderly widow has been living in a dilapidated mud shack with her seven grandchildren for years.When it rains, they have to pack up and leave the shack. When they return, everything they own would be destroyed.Three years ago, she submitted her documents to the local department of human settlements, but nothing has happened so far. It s much better to go into the grave rather than live in this hell shack should the RDP house that we were promised not come, Masilo said. Before the local elections last year, some officials came to me and promised to help with a decent RDP house after the election but they all vanished like water in sand. She lives in OR Tambo Section on the outskirts of Senekal.She said two community members, Tshediso Tshabalala and Dibuseng Matsotso, volunteered to help her to submit the required documents to the department three years ago, but there was still no resolution.When The New Age arrived while it was raining on Saturday, she was in the two-room flooded shack with one of her grandchildren, Lerato.Only one of her grandchildren is receiving a social grant. The other six do not have the required documents as they are orphans.Matsotso said the furniture in the shack was constantly being damaged by the rains; when it rained during the day, the elderly woman would often run to the neighbours with her grandchildren for shelter. We helped her to apply for a RDP house three years ago and submitted all the required documents but there was no solution, Matsotso said. I often have sleepless nights thinking about the unbearable situation Malerato is living under. Masilo blames the government for her suffering and has called on President Jacob Zuma and Free State Premier Ace Magashule to visit and see the conditions in which she lives.THABO THULOprovinces@thenewage.co.za
