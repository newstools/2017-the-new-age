Sentencing proceedings for convicted murderer Pieter van Tonder were postponed this morning. Van Tonder was convicted of the murder of his girlfriend’s 16-month-old daughter. He appeared briefly in the Western Cape High Court for the murder Asheeqah Scott, whom he was taking care of while her mother was doing laundry. Van Tonder reportedly pleaded guilty to killing toddler and admitted that he was under the influence of drugs when he killed her. He said that he slapped his girlfriend’s daughter, burned her lips with the “white pipe” of dagga and drove around with her, then braked on purpose so she could fall. An autopsy revealed that the little girl had suffered injuries to her head, face, neck and lips. The sentencing proceedings were first postponed in November as the court had not received the social worker’s report. -TNA Reporter
