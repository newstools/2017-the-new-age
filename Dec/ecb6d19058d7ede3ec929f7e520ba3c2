The renaming of the street names after struggle stalwarts helps deepen reconciliation in South Africa, President Jacob Zuma said on Saturday. Zuma was speaking at the road and bridge unveiling ceremony in Kwa-Zulu Natal at the Dumisane Makhaye Drive. During his address, the president said that unveiling of the bridge and road in remembrance of Makhaye was a monumental step in History. “Renaming streets helps rectify the inhumane things the apartheid regime subjected black people to, through the Group Areas Act,” Zuma said. He further said Makhaye dedicated most his life to the struggle, adding that he even went on and join Umkhonto weSizwe. Meanwhile, Minister of Transport Joe Maswanganyi said, the project cost the department an estimated amount of R1, 3-billion. “We have to invest in our infrastructure to ensure there is an easy flow of goods.” Maswanganyi added. The Dumisani Makhaye main road in Clermont is set to be one of the biggest road infrastructure developments in the country. The road is aimed at connecting communities of Newlands, KwaMashu, Inanda, KwaDabeka, Clermont and Pinetown. The road will also serve as an alternative route to the King Shaka International Airport. -Sipho Jack
