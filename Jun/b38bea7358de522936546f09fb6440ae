Nine-time champion Rafael Nadal powered into a record 10th French Open final on Friday and will face 2015 winner Stan Wawrinka for the title after the Swiss outdueled Andy Murray in a five-set epic.Nadal demolished Austrian pretender and sixth seed Dominic Thiem 6-3, 6-4, 6-0 to return to the final at Roland Garros for the first time since the last of his nine titles in 2014.Wawrinka became the oldest finalist in Paris in 44 years with a thrilling 6-7 (6/8), 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 (7/3), 6-1 win over world number one Murray.&#8220;I&#8217;ve played a very good event, played well in all the matches and today was no exception,&#8221; said Nadal, who has lost just 29 games in reaching Sunday&#8217;s championship match.&#8220;I started a bit more nervous, but then I played well.&#8220;It&#8217;s true that Dominic played with more mistakes than usual today, but it was windy.&#8221;Nadal is bidding to become the first man to win 10 titles at a single Grand Slam and leads the head-to-head with Wawrinka 15-3.&#8220;I always say the same but it&#8217;s true. Nine or 10, it&#8217;s only 10 percent more. It&#8217;s true 10 is a beautiful number, nine is my favourite, but if I win it will become 10.&#8221;However, he will be mindful of another upset after the Swiss stunned an injury-hit Nadal three years ago to claim the Australian Open crown.&#8220;I have been playing a great event. But Stan is playing unbelievable,&#8221; said Nadal, who despite his imposing record has split the past six meetings with Wawrinka.&#8220;It will be a super hard final and I will need to play at my very best.&#8221;Nadal withstood a shaky start before reeling off four games in succession to subdue Thiem, who was looking to be just the second Austrian finalist at a Slam after 1995 French Open winner Thomas Muster.Thiem is the only player to defeat Nadal on clay this season, but the fourth seed barely gave his rival a sniff and conceded just nine points in a chastening final set.&#8211; &#8216;Biggest challenge&#8217; &#8211; US Open champion Wawrinka, 32, triumphed in a pulsating four hour 34 minute battle of shotmaking and endurance and will target a fourth Slam title this weekend.For Murray, his wait to become Britain&#8217;s first men&#8217;s champion in Paris since Fred Perry in 1935 goes on.&#8220;It&#8217;s incredible to be in another Roland Garros final,&#8221; said Wawrinka, the oldest finalist since 33-year-old Niki Pilic was runner-up in 1973.His win avenged defeat to Murray at the same stage in 2016 and the Swiss suggested the Briton was nowhere near that form on Friday.&#8220;Last year he was much more aggressive but last year he was stronger,&#8221; said Wawrinka after reaching his fourth final at the majors.&#8220;Today I think he&#8217;s less confident. He played a bit less fast. He was a little more hesitant, and that gave me a bit more time to actually install my game.&#8221;But Wawrinka is in no doubt as to the nature of the obstacle that stands in his way of a second Roland Garros triumph.&#8220;I think to play Rafa on clay in French Open in a final is probably the biggest challenge you can have in tennis. He&#8217;s the best player ever on clay.&#8221;Murray, the 2016 runner-up to Novak Djokovic, admitted that Wawrinka was the stronger player in the end.&#8220;I tried to keep fighting, but he played well at the end,&#8221; said Murray.&#8220;I was a tiebreak from getting to the final in a tournament which I came into struggling.&#8221;For Thiem, it was a disappointing end to a tournament which had seen him defeat Djokovic in the quarter-finals.&#8220;I was not on top of my game and the result everybody saw,&#8221; he said.&#8220;It&#8217;s nice to be in the semis again, but I&#8217;m really disappointed because I just couldn&#8217;t play the way I wanted to. I don&#8217;t know why yet, so I have to find some reasons.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;I was a tiebreak from getting to the final in a tournament which I came into struggling.&#8221;For Thiem, it was a disappointing end to a tournament which had seen him defeat Djokovic in the quarter-finals.&#8220;I was not on top of my game and the result everybody saw,&#8221; he said.&#8220;It&#8217;s nice to be in the semis again, but I&#8217;m really disappointed because I just couldn&#8217;t play the way I wanted to.
