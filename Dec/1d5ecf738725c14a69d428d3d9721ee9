ANC Presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma has on Tuesday morning gained 21 more nominations from the KwaZulu Natal provincial general council to head the party now leaving her with a total of 454. This comes after the ANC KZN convened an early morning open session where the IEC verified the nomination results following allegations of vote tampering. Yesterday it was announced that Dlamini-Zuma had received 433 nominations. However, it emerged that nominations from the Moses Mabhida region were undercounted by 17 branches. There were also discrepancies in the nominations coming from the Abaqulusi regions. The reviewed numbers were a blow for deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa whose 193 nominations were scaled down to 191. ANC Mpumalanga chairperson, David Mabuza, who yesterday received 434 nominations to become ANC deputy president, today gained an additional 15 branches leaving him now on 449 nominations. Incumbent deputy secretary general, Jesse Duarte, who has been re-nominated for her position on Tuesday made gains moving from 357 to 372 nominations. Watch video below
