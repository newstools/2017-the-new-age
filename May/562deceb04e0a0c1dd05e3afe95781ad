AFTER calling South African Music Awards (Samas) organisers jealous on Saturday, West Ink founder and Big Nuz band member, Mampitsha apologised for his criticism of the Samas at Sun City on Saturday.Following Babes failure to win a single trophy from her four nominations, the man born Mandla Maphumulo posted a scathing video telling off the organisers for overlooking his artist. However, on Monday, he was more reconciliatory in his Instagram apology, saying he did not mean to cast aspersions on the integrity of the awards. The fact that we continue to enjoy support from ordinary people is an even bigger award for us. We therefore wish to apologise to all our supporters and society in general for the outburst by some of us soon after the Sama ceremony, the statement said. This unfortunate situation was due to a number of calls we were receiving from thousands of music lovers who were disappointed about the outcomes. SIYABONGA SITHOLE
