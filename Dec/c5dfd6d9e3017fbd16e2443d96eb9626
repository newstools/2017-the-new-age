A 37-year-old police officer stationed at Durban Central Police Station and four others have been arrested after they were implicated in the notorious Umlazi Glebelands hostel murders. The arrest follows the ongoing probes into murders at the hostel. The hostel has been marred by incidents of violent crimes which included murders and attempted murders. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Jay Naicker said the men were arrested yesterday after several units of the police conducted predawn raids at the two hostels. “The teams split into two groups, one group proceeded to Harding at KwaMachi where they arrested a 29-year-old suspect. “The second group went to Block 51 in Glebelands where a 45-year old man was arrested. “They also went to Block 43 where they arrested a 34-year-old suspect. During the search of his room, a police cap, two police reflector jackets, a state-issued laptop as well as a number of internal police correspondences were seized,” he said. Naicker said the police have been working very hard to make sure that crime at the two hostels is reduced. “Our detectives have been working very hard to bring down those behind the killings.” Acting Provincial Commissioner Bheki Langa said detectives have been working very hard to bring down those behind the killings and to ensure that investigations meet up to the high standard that is expected by our courts. “We also once again wish to thank members of the community who did eventually come forward and work with our investigators to unmask the perpetrators behind the violence. “We want criminals to know that they will not enjoy a peaceful festive season as long they are on the run from police.” The suspects are due to appear in court soon. -TNA Reporter
