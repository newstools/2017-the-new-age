It is an infringement of people s rights to ban the use of dagga by adults in private homes, the Western Cape High court ruled on Friday.The court also ruled that Parliament must change sections of the Drug Trafficking Act and the Medicines Control Act within the next 24 months as per the ruling.The application was brought by the Dagga Party leader Jeremy Acton and Gareth Prince.The Dagga party has welcomed the judgement and says the prohibition problematic from the beginning.&#8220;The nation is healthier from today. The possession, cultivation and use Dagga at home for private use is now a constitutional right, which means the scheduling of Dagga in the illicit drugs and trafficking act is invalid. Prohibition of Dagga was crime act against the people, we now have the constitutional right to grow our own Dagga, in our own home, for our own use,&#8221; Acton said.TNA REPORTER
