ANC Women’s League (ANCWL) president and Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini has lambasted Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa following his remarks on Fezekile  ‘Khwezi’ Khuzwayo. Khwezi accused President Jacob Zuma of sexually assaulting her but the president was acquitted in 2006. “You see, the comrade deputy president of the ANC decided to speak but he spoke about comrade Jacob Zuma. We want to say comrade Cyril, if you want to speak out about violence against women and children, talk about yourself. You must open up. It’s nice because you said you know how difficult it is for a woman to take a stand on this issue,” Dlamini said. Dlamini was speaking at an ANC rally in KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday. Ramaphosa said that although he accepted that Zuma was acquitted of the charges, he believed that Khwezi was raped. Dlamini said Ramaphosa should rather help women who struggle to take action against their perpetrators. “And you do have the experience. You know women who have not been able to take a stand on these matters. Help them, help us.” Meanwhile, the minister warned that people should not be selective of the cases of women abuse but treat them all equally. “We have always said that the issue of violence against women is an issue that must unite all women. It’s an issue that we must take a stand and we must not be pushed into a corner and support some and not support others.” -TNA Reporter
