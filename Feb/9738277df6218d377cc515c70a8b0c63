Most of the people got injured during the shoot and two are in hospital,&#8221; a resident said.Last week, Black First Land First&#8217;s (BLF) Brian Ungovernable said they were invited to assist at the Jabulani Flats community. The Madullammoho office was shut down for the whole day when they heard BLF was coming to see them.According to BLF the flats belong to the government. BLF indicated that a capital grant of R58 million was given to the company Madulammoho Housing Association to build 300 units (flats).Madulammoho Housing Association is a private company owned by a white man from Netherlands. An amount of R18 million was taken from 300 families as they were subsidised by the government and they continued to pay the rent, it only came to their realisation when they were applying for housing bonds, said ungovernable.Meanwhile, Madulammoho Housing Association CEO Renier Erasmus dismissed the claims, saying residents never received any letter from them.
