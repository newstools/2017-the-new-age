Two alleged kingpins in illegal chrome mining in Limpopo are expected to appear at the Lebowakgomo Magistrate Court on Monday. The total number that we arrested is eleven. They are appearing on different dates and at different courts. The two that we recently arrested will be appearing at the Lebowakgomo Magistrate Court today for charges related to illegal mining, said the SAPS Limpopo spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo.The pair face charges of contravening the Mineral Resources, Petroleum Act and the National Environmental Maintenance Act.Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane commended the police in the province following the arrests. We are encouraged that we are getting the masterminds behind the massive illegal operations which have been taking place in that area, he said.The police say that the pair from Pretoria and Rustenburg respectively were arrested following a high-density operation comprising of officials from the Department of Mineral Resources and SAPS which was conducted along the R37 road between Lebowakgomo and Burgersfort in Limpopo.Mining machinery including excavators, TLBs and trucks that were used in transporting the chrome as well as unprocessed chrome were confiscated.The two kingpins are linked to illegal mining activities, including buying and exporting chrome to foreign countries. We believe that there are people who were buying chrome from the site illegally and exporting it to foreign courtiers. Our investigations are ongoing, we don t believe that these are the only people that are involved in this, said Mojapelo.In addition to the machinery, the police say that they also confiscated laptops and invoices that will lead to more arrests.-TNA Reporter
