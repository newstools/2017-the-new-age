An attack on Yemen&#8217;s Hodeidah port would displace more than 400,000 people, the U.N. International Organization for Migration said on Friday, doubling its previous minimum estimate.&#8220;A minimum of 400,000 people will flee the city eastwards, once Al Hudaydah is under attack,&#8221; IOM&#8217;s Director of Operations and Emergencies Mohammed Abdiker said in a statement, using a different English spelling for the port&#8217;s name.The U.N. has previously warned against any attack by Saudi-led coalition forces on the Houthi-held port, the aid lifeline for millions of people in desperate need of food, saying that 200,000-500,000 people could be displaced.-Reuters
