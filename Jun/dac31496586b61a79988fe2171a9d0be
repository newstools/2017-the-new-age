A man who allegedly snatched a child from a woman in Seshego outside Polokwane on Sunday was admitted to hospital for treatment due to injuries he sustained at the hands of an angry mob.Police spokesperson Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe said the drama started when the man allegedly accosted a woman walking in the street with her five-yearold daughter and forcibly took the child at knife point. During the process, she screamed for help and community members responded in large numbers. They followed the suspect until he put the baby down. He ran into the river with the crowd in hot pursuit and was caught. He was then assaulted with an assortment of objects but was rescued by police who went to the scene swiftly after receiving a tip-off, Ngoepe said.The suspect was taken to hospital and will answer to charges including kidnapping in the Seshego Magistrate s Court as soon as he recovered from his injuries, police said. It appears that he is just a stranger to her but police investigations are continuing. In another development, police appealed to community members for information about an incident in which the body of a woman with some parts missing was recovered in the bushes outside the Maungani village near Thohoyandou last Saturday. The body of a woman who could be in her 20s also has multiple wounds to the head. She was wearing a greenlike legging and it appears she might have been killed somewhere and then dumped in the bushes. Anyone with information should contact Brig James Espach on 0825760743 or the nearest police station. People can also make arrangements with police to come and identify the body. Deputy provincial police commissioner for detectives Maj-Gen Bafana Linda has established a team jointly with the crime intelligence unit to hunt for the killers.MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
