Two weeks later, the mother of fiveyear-old Richard Thole is broken and weak as hopes of rescuing her baby alive are all but nil.Little Richard fell down a disused mine shaft in Jerusalem informal settlement two weeks ago.Yesterday Nombeko Thole cried hysterically during a prayer session in her home led by the Gauteng ANC Women s League. Looking weak and defeated the mother could not contain her tears as prayers for her son s recovery got under way.Speaking to The New Age she said that she could not sleep at all since her son fell down the mine shaft and it got worse as time goes on. It s hard to sleep, when I see kids return from school it reminds me that he would also be returning from school. My hope has faded but I hope the prayers will at least help us get closure, she said.Rescue operations for little Thole who fell down the mine shaft on February 25, were called off on the fourth day when rescuers came across major challenges with two massive rock falls that happened inside the shaft about 60m down impacting operations on the site.Since then there is still no decision yet on what is to be done to recover young Thole.South African National Defence Force (SANDF) officers were expected to hand over a report on the possibility of resuming rescue operations to the Ekurhuleni mayor s office on Wednesday but it was postponed.Spokesperson for mayor Mzwandile Masina s office, Gugu Ndima, said the SANDF had asked for more time to hand the report to the mayor.news@thenewage.co.za
