Numsa has rejected the latest wage proposal by engineering sector employers.Numsa acting national spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi said the union was shocked by the offer which employers have placed on the table, because the proposal can only be described as a downward variation of the basic working conditions of workers . We are horrified that employers want unions to help them to violate the basic principles of equal pay for work of equal value by offering new entrants to the sector only half of what they deserve. To add insult to injury, employers have the nerve to demand that workers give them amnesty for breaking the law and paying workers less than what they are legally obliged to pay Hlubi said.On top of the union s demands, it has demanded a 15% wage increase across the board based on the actual rate that a worker is earning and not on the minimum rate. Hlubi also said based on the latest proposal, the union was convinced that employers were provoking a deadlock in order to justify a strike.Prior to negotiations last week, Numsa general secretary Irvin Jim said although this year s wage talks occurred against a backdrop of political and economic instability in the country, workers were not prepared to embark on the same strike that took place in 2014, when Numsa members downed tools for almost a month following a wage talk impasse. In 2014 Numsa was forced to go on strike because employers in the sector stubbornly refused to engage meaningfully with our demands for a living wage and improved working conditions. That s because some employers in this sector believe in the super exploitation of black and African labour. Jim said.The talks between the union and the employers will take place again on Thursday.AKANI MANGENAnews@thenewage.co.za
