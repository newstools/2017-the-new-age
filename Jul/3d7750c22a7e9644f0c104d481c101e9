A human rights group has called for the urgent protection of civilians as attacks by warring groups on vulnerable communities continue unabated in the Central African Republic (CAR).South Africa has in the past contributed to maintaining stability in CAR.Since 2013, conflicts between the predominantly Muslim Seleka rebel group and anti-Balaka militia have plunged the country into civil war, forcing almost half a million people to seek refuge in other countries.Former president Francois Bozize was ousted from his position by the Seleka rebel group. Following an attack on their base, South Africa pulled out all remaining soldiers.The Human Rights Watch (HRW) call comes after the killing of at least 566 civilians over the last two years.In a report titled Killing without consequence: war crimes, crimes against humanity and the special criminal court in the Central African Republic, the HRW said UN peacekeepers should do more to protect civilians from the crimes.HWR said the signing of a peace accord has failed to protect civilians from killings and displacement.The HRW conducted interviews with affected communities which revealed the killings were directed at civilians, together with sexual assaults and hunger in provinces such as NanaGrebizi, Ouaka, Ouahm and Haute Kotto. More than 4 207 homes were also destroyed during this period. Countrywide, armed groups forced tens of thousands of people from their homes and into the bush, where hundreds died of exposure, disease or hunger. In some cases, Seleka fighters attacked displacement camps. At least 37 civilians were killed and 57 wounded while thousands were forced to flee when Seleka fighters razed a camp in Kaga-Bandoro on October 12, 2016, the report said.It said that no actions have been taken against those involved in the attacks.The report said crimes being committed against civilians fall under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC only has capacity to target those most responsible for serious crimes. Scores of other commanders bear criminal responsibility for atrocities they have committed or ordered, it said.In April this year, during his visit to South Africa, CAR leader Faustin Archange Touadera said a memorial would be erected in the country for South African soldiers who were killed there in 2013.Touadera held discussions with President Jacob Zuma during his visit.A total of 15 SA soldiers were killed and 27 wounded when they were ambushed by Muslim Seleka rebel group in Bangui.ZODIDI MHLANAzodidim@thenewage.co.za
