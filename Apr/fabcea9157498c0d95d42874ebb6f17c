State-run logistics company Transnet once again asserted itself as the leading provider of rolling stock in sub-Saharan Africa when it launched its new Trans-Africa locomotive yesterday in Koedoespoort, Pretoria.The train was conceptualised and engineered by a team of experts from within the company and assembled at the company s production facility in Koedoespoort.President Jacob Zuma, who launched it yesterday, said the innovation provided an opportunity for the company to grow and diversify its investment. He said it was specifically designed for the African landscape. The locomotive developed is a general purpose machine, Zuma said. It s also the perfect fit for most of the main lines in the SADC region where infrastructure prevents the use of heavier. Zuma described the innovation as an African solution to an African problem developed with African conditions in mind. The diesel-powered engine can be used on rail tracks originally designed to carry light axle loads.Transnet CEO Siyabonga Gama said the company made a capital investment of R350m to develop it. The locomotive that you see here will be pulling goods, it s a freight locomotive and will pull up to 8000 tons. It costs more than R350m to develop and design the locomotive, Gama said.The locomotive has a unique cabin design with front and rear facing windows, allowing for movement in both directions without obstructing the driver s view and caters for customers who cannot afford two locomotives per route.The engineering CEO Thamsanqa Jiyane said the company always had the capacity to design and manufacture it s locomotive destined for the African market.In March last year, Transnet handed more than 22 passenger coaches to Botswana railways. The train has since done more than 70000km on the track between Francistown and Lobatse.The company has always ordered locomotives from partners in the US, Europe and China.MTHOKOZISI DUBEmtokozisid@thenewage.co.za
