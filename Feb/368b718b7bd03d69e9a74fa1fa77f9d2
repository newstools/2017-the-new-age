THE Drop-The-Block Campaign rollout, which aims to minimise water used to flush toilets, officially started at Rocklands in Bloemfontein yesterday.The campaign is an initiative by the department of water and sanitation and has been described as an eco-friendly innovation where a block is placed inside the toilet water tank.Department spokesperson Kido Thoabala said the green plastic block (similar to bricks in size) is placed in a cistern of a household with waterborne toilet.These blocks will reduce two litres of water per flush. Once the block is installed, it requires no maintenance. It allows the toilet to perform its primary function of waste disposal.It is designed to reduce potable water consumption by one litre per flush, Thoabala said. On average, toilet flushing uses up to 31% of the overall household consumption. This makes toilet flushing one of the highest consumers of water in households. She said volunteers from across the city attended a two-hour training session teaching them to identify the different cisterns and also, the proper way of inserting the block in the cistern without damaging any component inside.The volunteers, who have proper identification, were also provided with forms that they have to fill in at every household they service.These forms will also serve as a survey to identify households with leaks. She said this initiative aimed to eradicate unnecessary water usage resulting in water scarcity.The water saving exercise was rolled out to all the five district municipalities in the province, including townships such as Pahameng and Bochabela in Bloemfontein, Section G2 and Section E in Botshabelo and Selosesha in ThabaNchu from yesterday until tomorrow.MICHAEL TLHAKUDI
