The Gauteng Department of Education will on Monday visit Parktown Boys High school to investigate allegations of sex abuse.The Gauteng Department said that it is very concerned about the allegations of sex abuse at Parktown Boys High School reported by media over the weekend. Media reports said that more than 20 boys had reported abuse at the hands of a 22-year-old assistant boarding master.The man, a former pupil, will appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate s Court on Wednesday. He faces charges of sexual grooming of children, sexual assault and assault.&#8220;The Department takes allegations of sex abuse in a very serious light and will launch our own investigation into the allegations,&#8221; said Gauteng Department of Education s Acting Head of Communication Oupa Bodibe.&#8220;The matter was not formally reported to the Department by the School, rather the Department became aware only after the issue became public. The failure by the school to report these serious allegations smack of an attempt to sweep them under the carpet.&#8221;Bodibe added that the investigation will also seek to determine the reason why the school failed to report the matter and the extent of the sex abuse at the school.&#8220;Any educator found guilty of this nature of misconduct should be dismissed, as they betray the duty to protect children under their care.&#8220;While the Department respects the court process currently under way, it is prudent to investigate the matter to determine what further steps must be taken,&#8221; said Bodibe.TNA Reporter
