Minister of Mineral Resources Mosebenzi Zwane has visited a state owned mine in Santiago, Chile which the department said had caused renewed interest in establishing such mines in the country.Zwane signed a memorandum of understanding with his Chilean counterpart, Aurora Elvira Williams, on cooperation in mining and minerals. Zwane visited the state-owned mining company Codelco and as a result Zwane and his team were eager to return home and accelerate the establishment of their own state-owned mining company which has been under discussion for some time, the department said. We believe it will assist us to further our transformation and development objectives as the government, Zwane said.The two countries will cooperate in areas such as mineral processing and beneficiation, sharing experiences in policy formulation and the regulatory framework and sharing knowledge and related functions, among other things.Zwane used the Latin American Mining Cumbre conference in Santiago to meet current and potential investors on South Africa s investment landscape, including the controversial mining charter. Investors welcomed the frank and open manner in which we engaged with them, and have committed to partnering with us to invest in the South African mining sector, Zwane said.
