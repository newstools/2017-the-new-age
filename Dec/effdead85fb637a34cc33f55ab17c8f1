Music hitmaker Robbie Malinga has passed away after suffering from a life-threatening illness. Malinga had been diagnosed with anaemia. Malinga spent much of 2017 in-and-out of hospital being treated for anaemia. People took to Twitter to send their condolences to the Malinga family. In November they were rumours that the the veteran musician had died after his name appeared on the trend list only to found out later that the trend was simply in response to the release of his new album. -TNA Reporter
