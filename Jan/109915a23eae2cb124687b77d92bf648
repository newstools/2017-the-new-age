Yesterday the Grace Bible Church in Soweto was a hive of activity as LGBTI activists staged a peaceful silent march against a homophobic sermon delivered a week ago by bishop Day Heward-Mills.The protesters took to the streets of Soweto in solidarity with Idols SA judge and dancer Somizi Mhlongo who recently stormed out of the church after he was angered by Heward-Mills s controversial sermon which referred to homosexuality as unnatural. You don t find two male dogs, two male lions, two male impalas, two male lizards. You don t find that in nature. That is unnatural. There is nothing like that in nature, Heward-Mills said during the service.Explaining the march s purpose, which picked up momentum on social media with the hashtag #OccupyGraceBibleChurch, Motsau Motsau said: We are not trying to debate whether the Bible is right or wrong, we are simply saying let the church refrain from preaching a message that discriminates against us. In response to the debate, a live stream was posted on YouTube by the Grace Bible Church bishop, Mosa Sono, yesterday in which he defended the church s constitutional right to determine rules and conditions of membership.He said the church was aware of the killings of gays and lesbians and he condemned such actions, Sono said.
