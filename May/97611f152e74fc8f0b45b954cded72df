As the Dundee July approaches, the KZN department of sport and recreation has already commenced with plans to sharpen provincial candidates for the province s biggest rural horse racing competition.The Dundee July, which is modelled along the lines of the Durban July, will be held in the last week of July at the revamped Dundee racecourse.It attracts rural horse racers from across the country and neighbouring countries who are not the professional level required to take part in the Durban July, which is held on the first Saturday of July in Durban.Speaking in Nquthu on Saturday, sport and recreation MEC Bongi Sithole-Moloi pledged to do everything possible to help end the dominance of jockeys from outside the country in the upcoming Dundee July.The annual horse racing event is known to attract competitors and fans from neighbours including Lesotho and nearby provinces like Mpumalanga and Free State.Sithole-Moloi said the department had pumped R50000 sponsorship into the competition.She further said her department recently took a decision to fund all the districts rural horse racing competitions in order to give the sport a boost. Our aim is to aid all competitions with funds to be used, particularly, for training for both jockeys and horses as well and horse healthcare to ensure that when the Dundee July comes our horses and jockeys are more than ready. She emphasised the importance of her department s decision, saying KZN as the host province should lead with medals in such competitions.In the previous editions, horses from Lesotho had proved to be the strongest and it had become a norm for them to take home most of the silverware. I think time has come for jockeys to end Lesotho s dominance and we have to ensure that this time around our own horses dominates the show, Sithole-Moloi said.She said it was important that competitions such as the Nquthu Rural Horse Race were given the necessary support to ensure that they become equal to the task in major competitions. When we design these competitions, we do them to empower local people, particularly the rural ones, economically and we cannot proudly say we have achieved our goals if these competitions are taken away from them. She also said that sponsoring all districts would help to raise the number of fans in the Dundee July beyond 10000 fans who turned up in the previous edition. Ncome Local Horse Race Association chairperson Bongani Ngobese expressed gratitude on the behalf of his fellow horse breeders.This association has never received any funds from the government before, Ngobese said.He said before the Nquthu Rural Horse Race was launched, the locals used to take part in horse racing just for fun. Ngobese, who has been involved in horse racing for more than 30 years now, says he wishes that all horse racing associations in the province receives enough funds to develop the sport.TNA REPORTERprovinces@thenewage.co.za
