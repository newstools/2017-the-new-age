The trial of former National Prosecuting Authority attorney and now DA MP Glynnis Breytenbach and her lawyer will resume today in the Pretoria North Magistrate s Court.The case was scheduled to resume yesterday but was postponed to today due to the absence of a prosecutor.Breytenbach and Johan Wagenaar are facing charges of defeating the ends of justice and contravening the National Prosecuting Authority Act.This follows the claim by the NPA that Breytenbach deleted evidence on her laptop while she was still the head of the organisation s specialised commercial crimes unit in Pretoria.Last year, the Pretoria North Magistrate s Court heard that Breytenbach went ahead with deleting information contained on her work laptop despite being warned that such action could see her being prosecuted.However, Breytenbach argued she was suspended by the NPA because of her insistence that the criminal case against former crime intelligence head Richard Mdluli should proceed.The NPA s internal investigator, Thobile Chita, testified in October that investigators working on allegations of misconduct against Breytenbach in 2012, were not aware of the events around the prosecution of former crime intelligence boss Richard Mdluli.Former prosecuting authority chief executive, Karen van Rensburg told the court that she was called to a meeting with former national director of Public Prosecution Menzi Simelane in November 2011 where Simelane briefed her on a complaint related to mining rights dispute between Arcelor Mittal and Khumba Iron ore.TNA REPORTERnews@thenewage.co.za
