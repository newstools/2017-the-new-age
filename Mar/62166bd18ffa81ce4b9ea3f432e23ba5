POLICE have appealed to residents of Moloto and surrounding areas near KwaMhlanga to remain vigilant of armed intruders. This comes after an armed robber forced himself into a house in Moloto on Friday night. He was stabbed to death by the house owner. Police said cases of murder, burglary and possession of an unlicensed firearm were opened for further investigation. The house owner was not arrested for the killing because he acted in selfdefence, police said. KwaMhlanga police spokesperson Capt Nonhlanhla Kgosana said their preliminary investigations showed the house owner and other family members were asleep when their 14-year-old son saw the robber inside the house and screamed for help. Kgosana said the intruder pointed a firearm at the house owner and ordered him to hand over money. She said in the process of the attack, the house owner wrestled with the intruder. He killed the intruder with a knife after being assisted by his son. According to information at the police s disposal, the family were asleep when the intruder gained access to the house. The son informed his father about a strange noise in the house and his father went to investigate when he was confronted by the man who pointed a firearm at him. The victim told the intruder that the money he wanted was kept in his bedroom. But on their way to the bedroom, the victim overpowered the intruder and stabbed him to death with a knife brought to him by his son, Kgosana said. She said the firearm, which was in possession of the deceased, was found at the scene and taken for forensic ballistic testing. Police were also checking if the robber was involved in other criminal activities. A revolver with live rounds and the knife were recovered at the scene and were taken for further investigation. Police are profiling the deceased to ascertain if he was involved in other cases before his death, Kgosana said. FRANCE NYAKA
