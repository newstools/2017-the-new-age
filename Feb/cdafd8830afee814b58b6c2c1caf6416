Romania&#8217;s parliament on Monday unanimously endorsed a presidential plan to hold a national referendum over anti-corruption reforms after mass street protests forced the government into an embarrassing U-turn over a graft decree.President Klaus Iohannis, a former leader of the centre-right opposition, blasted the government over the decree that would have effectively shielded dozens of public officials from prosecution and torpedo a drive to stamp out high-level graft.The architect of the decree, Justice Minister Florin Iordache, resigned last week, citing a need to appease public opinion in the European Union member state of 20 million, and arguing he had done nothing wrong.The month-old Social Democrat government rescinded the decree one week ago after the biggest protests in the country since the fall of communism in 1989.Iohannis now needs to come up with a timeframe to hold the referendum. While the wording on the ballot paper is up to the president, he said last month he wanted to hold the vote to see &#8220;the sovereign desire of Romanians,&#8221; over the anti-graft drive.According to law, a 30-day campaign must take place before the vote.Parliament, where the ruling coalition holds a big majority, must still vote on whether to confirm the decree&#8217;s withdrawal.On Friday, Liviu Dragnea, the Social Democrat leader and lower house speaker, said parliament should meet to approve the withdrawal as soon as possible.Parliament&#8217;s vote on the presidential referendum plan was a necessary procedural step, but its opinion is not binding.Anti-government demonstrators took to the streets for a 13th consecutive day on Sunday, though numbers have fallen sharply since a week ago when about a half of a million people took part in capital Bucharest and dozens of other cities.-Reuters
