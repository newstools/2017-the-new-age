Oakbay Investments acting CEO Ronica Ragavan on Tuesday expressed its satisfaction on the proceedings in the Gordhan vs Oakbay matter.Ragavan said now it needed the Minister of Finance, Financial Intelligence Centre and the banks to give the company the information it needed to fully clear its name.FM Pravin Gordhan has approached the North Gauteng High Court to ask it for a declaratory order confirming that he cannot intervene in a dispute between the Gupta-owned Oakbay Investments and four major banks.All four banks in 2016 closed the Oakbay banking accounts without giving reasons for the decision. We are delighted that the FIC report, Deputy Minister Jonas s affidavit and any reference to either of them have been struck from the Finance Minister s application, Ragavan said. As the Court agreed, the report and the Jonas affidavit are irrelevant to the application. They serve no purpose but to further the Minister s own political agenda and to tarnish the Group s image. But she said that the transactions in the FIC report cited by the minister in his application had destroyed the reputation of the company. For months we have said the list of 72 transactions has been a tool to smear our name and drive unsubstantiated negative media coverage of our business and our shareholders. When attached to a totally unnecessary application, with no contested legal issue, it becomes clear what the Finance Minister is up to, she said.She called on the Minister, banks, the FIC &#8211; in fact anyone with the power and authority to release the full details of the 72 transactions. The truth will come out in the end and today is just the start, she said.-TNA Reporter
