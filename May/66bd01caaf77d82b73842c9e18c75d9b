A court hearing of two long serving Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) officials Mandla Mahlangu and Temane Binang have been postponed to June 9 by the North Gauteng High Court.The duo, who face charges of fraud, extortion and contravention of the Ipid Act, made their first appearance today.During court proceedings, the defence lawyer asked the court not to entertain the application brought before it, and should see it as a ploy to remove the investigators from continuing to investigate the national commissioner Khomotso Phahlane. It is unthinkable that anyone can make false statement to influence somebody in this serious charge of corruption. The court should not entertain this application as it is an attempt to remove investigators from Phahlane case,&#8221; defence lawyer argued.In its court papers, Ipid wanted the court to declare that it was unlawful for any police investigator who is the subject of an Ipid investigation to probe or oversee investigations into members of the watchdog body.The watchdog head Robert McBride had on several occasions accused Phahlane of playing a personal role in handpicking the police officers to investigate Ipid members, adding that some of those police themselves were being investigated on several charges of assault and torture.-TNA Reporter
