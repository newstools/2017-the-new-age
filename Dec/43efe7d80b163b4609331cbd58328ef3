Two suspects are expected to appear in the Komatipoort Magistrate’s Court today for smuggling and dealing in illegal firearms. The suspects were arrested during an Intelligence-driven operation on Sunday morning comprising of various disciplines of the South African Police Service (Saps), both from the police head office and the Limpopo province. It is alleged that the suspects, aged 17 and 35, were smuggling arms into South Africa through the border near the Komatipoort area of Mpumalanga. Police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said a total of seven AK47 rifles, 180 rounds of ammunition and a Toyota Hilux double cab bakkie were recovered during the arrest. “During the arrest and recovery, one AK47 rifle was recovered fastened against the exhaust system underneath the vehicle. All the rifles will be sent for ballistic testing to the Saps Forensic Science laboratory,” Naidoo said. Naidoo said the type of weapons that were found are generally used to commit aggravated robberies such as cash-in-transit heists, vehicle hijackings and house and business robberies. Meanwhile, National Police Commissioner Lieutenant-General Khehla Sitole has welcomed the arrests and praised the Intelligence team for its excellent work. “Combating the proliferation of arms and ammunition forms part of our six-pillar priorities during the festive season,” Sitole said. “Removing such firearms from our streets will certainly help to reduce the risk of these robberies being committed.” -TNA Reporter
