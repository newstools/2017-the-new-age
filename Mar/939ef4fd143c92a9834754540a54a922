Eight-division world champion Manny Pacquiao&#8217;s proposed fight against Britain&#8217;s former world light-welterweight champion Amir Khan has been postponed, according to the Filipino&#8217;s promoter, Bob Arum.The 38-year-old Pacquiao and Khan, who won a silver medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics, tentatively agreed to an April fight in the United Arab Emirates before negotiating a change of date to May 20.Arum, however, told the Los Angeles Times that the $38 million offer for the bout had failed to materialise and that the duo could not face each other until the second half of 2017, under revised terms.&#8220;Manny wanted to roll the dice. He rolled the dice and it came up snake eyes (double one),&#8221; Arum said of the WBO world welterweight champion. &#8220;That deal is done for now.&#8221;Arum said Pacquiao&#8217;s advisor Michael Koncz would deliver a revised proposal for a fight against an alternative opponent that could be staged in July.&#8220;Koncz will meet with Manny, and if he accepts it, we&#8217;ll go ahead. If he doesn&#8217;t, there&#8217;s nothing we can do,&#8221; Arum added.Pacquiao (59-6-2) claimed the WBO title with a unanimous points victory over American Jessie Vargas in Las Vegas last November, while the 30-year-old Khan (31-4) has not fought since May 2016.Khan made an audacious set up to middleweight to take on Canelo Alvarez but the Briton was knocked out by his hard-hitting Mexican opponent in the sixth round.-Reuters
