Revenue for the black-owned JSE listed platinum mine Royal Bofokeng decreased by 3.2% to R1.594bn for the six months to June. The slump in revenue induced a decline in gross profit from R188m to R11.3m, which resulted in a net loss of R27.3m relative to 2016 s profit of R216.6m.The headline loss a share fell to at least 15.3c a share from 77.8c a share previously. RBPlat estimates joint venture capital expenditure for the second half of the year to be R1.5bn, with the key driver remaining the construction programme of the Styldrift I project. Operations will mainly focus in consolidating Styldrift infrastructure development, construction and resourcing to ensure that production output from Styldrift continues to steadily increase in line with its 150 000 tons/month ramp-up phase in the coming months.The company says this will equate to a full year forecast of R2.3bn against previously guided capital expenditure of R3.2bn. In addition, SIB capital expenditure is forecasted to remain between 4% and 5% of operating expenditure for the remainder of the year. The platinum market is forecast to be in a modest surplus (excluding investment demand) for this year and prices are expected to have limited upside from current levels, resulting in margins remaining under pressure for the remainder of the year. The restructured business is expected to enhance margins going forward and it remains important for the group to contain costs and defer non-essential capital expenditure, RBPlat said. -NONHLANHLA MASEKO|business@thenewage.co.za
