Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is sending a cabinet-level delegation to Beijing this week to meet with China&#8217;s Vice Premier Wang Yang and other top Chinese officials to discuss investment deals and his country&#8217;s chairmanship of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) this year.The Jan. 23-24 trip by Philippine officials includes Duterte&#8217;s finance, budget, economic, public works and transport secretaries, according to a statement from the Department of Finance on Sunday.The visit occurs three months after Duterte visited Beijing to pave the way for what he called a new commercial alliance. He has increased his overtures to China since assuming office last year while berating traditional ally the United States, a sharp change in Philippine foreign policy.The Beijing mission to court China and tap loans and business follows Duterte&#8217;s &#8220;pro-Filipino&#8221; policy aimed at reducing the reliance on a U.S. that he says he has lost faith in.Duterte will make a second China visit in May for a bilateral summit, China&#8217;s Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin said after meeting with him in Manila last week. That meeting was just days after Duterte&#8217;s meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.Meetings during the visit will also discuss the Philippines&#8217; chairmanship of the 10-member ASEAN this year, the Department of Finance said in a statement, without elaborating.Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay said on Jan. 11 that he was confident a code of conduct in the South China Sea between ASEAN and China could be finished by mid-2017. Still, the Philippines did file a diplomatic protest with China over its installation last year of anti-aircraft and anti-missile systems on its manmade islands in the disputed waters.At this week&#8217;s meeting, Philippine and Chinese officials will flesh out some $15 billion worth of investment pledges that China committed to Manila during Duterte&#8217;s visit in October, the Department of Finance said.Philippine Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi is also in China to &#8220;enhance energy cooperation&#8221; between the two countries and attract investments in local energy projects, his office said in a separate statement.Japan&#8217;s Abe, who wants to deepen ties with Duterte amid a changing geopolitical landscape, has pledged $9 billion worth of investment and development aid for the Philippines.-Reuters
