The Presidency is yet to make a decision regarding Police Minister Fikile Mbalulaâ€™s request over the deployment of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) to crime hotspots across the country. In October, Mbalula requested that soldiers assist the police to fight crime in the country. Mbalula is reportedly seeking soldiers to go into communities that are filled with criminality in the Western Cape, Port Elizabeth and Gauteng. The Defence Force will be working on specific police-driven operations over a period of time. The minister made a statement that the SANDF would be deployed before Christmas. Currently, there has not been any response from the the Presidency, on the matter. -TNA Reporter
