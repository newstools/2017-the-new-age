The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) on Thursday said it successfully initiated a test case to directly pay 100 social grant beneficiaries using commercial bank accounts of their choice as part of the January 2018 payment cycle. Sassa and the SA Post Office earlier this month reached an agreement to use a new social grant payment system that will see recipients getting their grants from banks and various merchants. “With effect from 01 February 2018, Sassa will continue to make direct deposits into all beneficiary commercial bank accounts. Sassa has received and confirmed details of the commercial bank accounts of about 2 001233 beneficiaries, who are receiving their social grants through banks​.​” said Sassa CEO Pearl Bengu. Bengu said 100 beneficiaries test case is part of implementing Sassa’s plan to insource social grant payments. The plan will be implemented in an incremental and phased manner leading to a desired future state where Sassa owns, operates and delivers a ‘’one stop’’ Grant Administration and Payment Service. However, Sassa will continue to pay all beneficiaries who receive their grants at cash paypoints or who use various merchants throughout the country. The Sassa Payment Card use has been extended until 31 December 2018 and will be used to access social grants. -TNA Reporter
