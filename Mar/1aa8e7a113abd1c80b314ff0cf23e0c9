My advice would be for De Villiers to approach Legal Aid and his bail be extended to Tuesday, Persad said.The case was postponed to Monday, March 14. His attorney who has now withdrawn, advocate Annade Theart, told the court that de Villiers would be unrepresented on Tuesday.De Villiers said he had only told his lawyer about the lack of funds yesterday morning before he appeared in court. I am self employed and with all the impact of the media and everything else that has been happening, that has affected my income, he said. Persad said de Villiers s request was unreasonable, as he was found guilty of raping a minor.NONDUMISO ZWANEnews@thenewage.co.za
