&nbsp;Dean Elgar struck a fine century as South Africa reached stumps on 297/6 on day one of the second Test against Sri Lanka at Newlands in Cape Town yesterday.The hosts were asked to bat first by Sri Lanka and were soon in trouble at 66/3 after Stephen Cook (0), Hashim Amla and JP Duminy (0) all returned to the pavilion early.Elgar and captain Faf Du Plessis then went about restoring order to the Proteas innings with a fourth wicket stand of 76 runs in two hours before Du Plessis (38) cut Rangana Herath to Angelo Mathews at first slip.Du Plessis was given a lifeline on 31 when he was dropped by Upul Tharanga at mid-off off the bowling of Rangana Herath.Tharanga put the catch down but it didn t cause too much trouble as Du Plessis added only seven runs to his tally before he was out.Elgar and Amla had added 66 runs for the second wicket after Sunga Lakmal had dismissed Stephen Cook for a duck with the fourth ball of the innings.He was caught by Kusal Mendis behind the stumps to leave SA at 0/1.Cook could have probably left the delivery alone, but the line and length tempted him into feel just outside his off stump as he edged it through to the keeper. Kamara was the destroyer in chief as five balls later in the same over, he had Duminy on the hook caught down the leg side for a duck.Temba Bavuma did not last long and he was out for 10 after facing 28 balls in 30 minutes after tea.He launched the ball straight down Upul Tharanga s throat at backward square leg.While wickets fell at regular intervals, Elgar fought on and went on to reach his well deserved century.South Africa could have been in a much worse position were it not for Elgar s pluckiness at the crease.The left-hander assessed the conditions early on and traded his expansive cover drive for soft hands and good judgment on the offside.After a testing day with the bat, it was the 103-run partnership between Elgar and De Kock that swung the momentum to the Proteas.De Kock was unbeaten on 60 and will resume today with night watchman Kyle Abbot as they look to post a big score.He reached his 50 off just 58 balls to provide exactly the impetus South Africa needed late in the day, but it was Elgar who really stepped up for the Proteas.Elgar s innings was not only expertly manufactured, but it was one that the Proteas desperately needed after they had lost Stephen Cook in the first over of the day and then slumped to 66/3.Throughout all of the uncertainty, Elgar stood firm as he employed his now familiar grittiness once again to register his sixth Test century.The celebrations that followed showed just how much the knock meant to Elgar, who had carded scores of 45 and 52 in the first Test in Port Elizabeth without pushing on.Neville Khoza|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
