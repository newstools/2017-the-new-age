Eggs contaminated with insecticide have been discovered in 40 countries, including South Africa, German news agency DPA said yesterday. However, the South African government has not made any announcement on the egg contamination issue. The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said yesterday the eggs fell under the jurisdiction of the Department of Health’s food control director, Penny Campbell. “We have engaged with them on the matter of these consignments and were able to assist them in detaining the container in Durban through our Directorate of Inspection Services Durban port office, but the jurisdiction is theirs,” the director: animal health in the Department of Agriculture, Mphane Molefe, said. Campbell could not be reached for comment yesterday. The insecticide, fipronil, disrupts insects’ central nervous systems and is considered moderately toxic in humans, causing organ damage. The poison is widely used to treat pets for ticks and fleas but its use in the food chain – for example, to clean out barns – is forbidden. Millions of eggs have been pulled from European supermarket shelves, though some national regulators have voiced concern that many contaminated eggs have already entered the food chain, mainly through processed products such as biscuits, cakes and salads. By the start of this week, 24 of the 28 EU countries had reported cases of tainted eggs, while 16 non-EU countries had also reported cases. The non-EU states in which contaminated eggs have been discovered include South Africa, Switzerland, Hong Kong, the US, Russia and Turkey. Two Dutch men who run a cleaning company and distributed the insecticide to a supplier of cleaning products in the Netherlands were arrested last month. -NONHLANHLA MASEKO|nonhlanhlam@thenewage.co.za
