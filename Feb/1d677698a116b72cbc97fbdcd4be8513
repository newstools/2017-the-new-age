India skipper Virat Kohli closed in on yet another double century Friday as he combined with Ajinkya Rahane to plunder a wilting Bangladesh bowling attack on the second day of the one-off Test in Hyderabad.Overnight batsmen Kohli (191 not out) and Rahane (82) put on 222 runs for the fourth wicket to help take India&#8217;s score to 477 for four at lunch.Kohli and Wriddhiman Saha (four) were at the crease at the break after Rahane was the only wicket to fall in the morning session. The hosts had started the day on 356-3.Mehedi Hasan took a brilliant catch to dismiss Rahane off the bowling of Taijul Islam but Bangladesh were otherwise undone by some sloppy fielding.Skipper Mushfiqur Rahim, who is also Bangladesh&#8217;s wicketkeeper, was among those at fault when he missed a stumping off Taijul&#8217;s bowling to give Saha a reprieve just before lunch.Kohli, who has made three double centuries since July, made life tough for the tourists with his effortless stroke-making.He raced from his overnight score of 111 to notch up his 150 in 170 balls, and also registered the most Test runs in a home season after Virender Sehwag&#8217;s previous record of 1,105 in 17 innings.Kohli, who has now scored 16 Test centuries, survived a close lbw call off Hasan after he was originally given out by the umpire.He then reviewed the decision and the TV replays suggested the ball was sliding down the leg side after hitting his pad.Rahane, who was dropped on 62 by Sabbir Rahman in the deep, was no less effective and hit 11 boundaries during his 133-ball stay at the crease.On the opening day, Murali Vijay (108) and Cheteshwar Pujara (98) put on 178 runs for the second wicket to lay a solid foundation after the hosts elected to bat first.AFP
