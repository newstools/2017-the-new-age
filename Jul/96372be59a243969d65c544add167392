A 19-year-old was on Monday sentenced to life imprisonment for raping a 35-year-old woman, Alice Ozar.Justice John Adeyeye found John Julius guilty of raping Ozar in her farm, Efon Alaaye in Efon Local Government area.According to punchng.com, Ozar told the court that Julius kicked her and she fell to the ground, after which he pressed her to the ground, tore her underwear and had carnal knowledge of her.It is said that Julius met Ozar while she was working on her farm and pretended as if he wanted to help her. Unfortunately, it will appear I have no discretion on the issue of sentence in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in Lucky v State (Supra) where it was held thus: Any person who commits the offence of rape be liable to imprisonment for life. Once the court convicts an accused person for the offence of rape as defined in Section 357 of the Code, it has no discretion but is bound to obey the law by imposing a term of imprisonment for life. Consequently, the defendant is hereby sentenced to life imprisonment, said Justice Adeyeye.-TNA reporter &nbsp;
