AN ASSOCIATE professor at North West University (NWU) Mahikeng Campus, Prof Freddy Samuel Khunou, has published a book on the rich history of the Bakwena Ba Mogopa tribe.The book is titled Mountains of Spirit and gives a detailed account of the history of the tribe and how its values have endured over the years.Published by Rainbird (a division of Bookstorm Publishers), the book gives an insight into traditional leadership and provides a detailed account of the rich history and resilience of the Bakwena ba Mogopa tribe, one of the most important traditional communities in South Africa. This work depicts the scope of social, political and economic change of the community from its earliest beginnings as the Kwena tribe migrating from East Africa to southern Africa. It focuses on the birth of the tribe as a distinct and independent lineage in the 1600s, the impact of land dispossession of the Boer settlers as they advanced from the Cape Colony into the interior, the impact of Christianity, the racist and oppressive attitudes and policies of colonial governments, through to the hardships endured under the Union government and apartheid, Khunou said.He said Mountains of Spirit captures the role that the traditional leaders of the Bakwena ba Mogopa played in shaping the community and responding to the challenges of the modern economy and constitutional democracy of South Africa. It is an important study of the tribal structures, the social, cultural and traditional practices and the questions of land, minerals and mining rights of the Bakwena ba Mogopa. This is a story that spans migrations, wars, land dispossession and restitution, intra-tribal rivalry, unrest, cultural disintegration, forced removals, pain, suffering and reintegration, he said.Prof Khunou is an associate professor in the school of postgraduate studies of research in the Law Faculty at the Mahikeng campus.He has published a considerable number of articles in both national and international accredited journals.Khunou qualified as an advocate of the High Court of South Africa and is a member of the Polokwane Society of Advocates.ELFAS TORERAI
