The ANC Youth League in the Free State says it welcomes plans by the provincial government to prioritise youth development.It said the state of the province address that was presented by Premier Ace Magashule earlier this week demonstrated the commitment by the provincial government.In a statement the league s spokesperson, Sello Pietersen, said they were particularly pleased that the Sopa provided practical meaning and content to the radical socio-economic programme.He said some of the key practical interventions included the state procurement preference to provide local businesses, which are owned by women and young people, as well as cooperatives. The agreement with Filtration Products Corporation for support and training of motor mechanics and panel beaters across the province was also cited as an exciting development.Pietersen said the 781 youth-owned entities that had benefitted from government procurement were much welcomed. We believe we will go a long way in ensuring that we create an inclusive and deracialised economy, the spokesperson said.They also welcomed the Botshabelo Industrial Park R60m project aimed at revitalising industrial parks in the province, focusing on security infrastructure upgrades, fencing and street lighting and electricity requirements as well as the implementation of the Mabele bio-fuel refinery in Bothaville and both the Xhariep solar park project and Matjhabeng local municipality solar plant.He said the ANCYL had noted with pride that the Sopa remained true to the ANC election manifesto commitment to prioritise youth development and has indeed reflected a number of inputs such as the refurbishment and conversion of old government buildings into student accommodation, the 30% set aside for youth businesses in all the major contracts in the province and the provision of bursaries to young deserving students to study abroad.KAMOGELO SEEKOEI|kamogelos@thenewage.co.za
