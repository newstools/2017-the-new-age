The late legendary jazz singer Mirriam Makeba s granddaughter Zenzi MakebaLee and friends will be celebrating the first annual Mirriam Makeba birthday concert on March 2 at the Orbit Jazz club, Braamfontein, in Johannesburg.The concert will be the first in a series of concerts aimed at honouring the legacy of the late stuggle icon.Speaking to The New Age, concert organiser and family friend Mandla Baloyi said the concert is an effort by the Khawuleza hitmaker s family to keep the jazz genre and Makeba s legacy alive. As a family we have always celebrated her birthday. This year we are celebrating through a concert that will bring together jazz enthusiasts and South Africans at large to come celebrate the life of the woman that contributed so much into our country, Baloyi said.The concert has reeled in some of the most talented and fresh jazz talents that include Standard Bank Jazz winners Siya Makhuzeni and Africa Mkhize. The jazz singers will also be joined by Mama s (Makeba) great-grandson Lindelani Makeba who has displayed a jazz talent over the years, Baloyi said.Makeba was known worldwide for her exceptional contribution to the field of music and the struggle for a free and democratic South Africa.Proceeds from the concert will go to Makeba House, a home for homeless teenage girls situated in Midrand. The home is still very much operative. We are continuing with Mama s legacy. We want to make sure that her legacy in music continues to do the same, Baloyi said.Mama Africa bowed off the stage for good in November 2008 in Italy. The Pata Pata hitmaker was 76 years old when she died at a Naples hospital after performing at the Castel Volturno.Tickets are obtainable at 011 339 6645 or email info@theorbit.co.za.news@thenewage.co.za
