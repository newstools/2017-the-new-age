Over 30 000 employees of Shoprite Checkers Group embarked on a ​legal strike today. This follows a change of working hours and a dismissal of staff members who have challenged these changes. Workers are demanding that the Group reverse the changes made with regards to working hours and reinstate the dismissed staff. The striking workers are affiliated to the South African Commercial Catering and Allied Workers Union (SACCAWU). SACCAWU has warned Shoprite Group of a full blown strike if they do not heed to the demands of the workers. The workers have listed a number of demands including, reinstating the workers of Checkers in Sandton, reversal of changes to working hours, guaranteed minimum working hours for part time employees and safe transportation for night shift workers. SACCAWU’s Secretary Coordinator Lucas Ramathlodi said the strike is as a result of the company refusing to accept that the changes of working hours affect workers negatively and therefore the company has to take responsibility. “It is not ok​ay​ for workers to continue to suffer the vulnerabilities that are imposed to them by situations introduced by the company, when all these workers are doing is to generate massive profits for the same company,” Ramathlodi said. In a statement Shoprite Group has confirmed that a one-day work stoppage in some Shoprite and Checkers supermarkets may take place today. The group has expressed its disappointment about the possibility of costumers not experiencing the service the Group would like to deliver in the height of the Festive season. However the group said it respects the rights of employees to protest in a peaceful and lawful manner. -TNA Reporter
