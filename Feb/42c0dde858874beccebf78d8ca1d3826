South Africa s foreign outward investment has not changed significantly over the course of the previous three years, but multinationals such as Sasol, Steinhof and Goldfields have continued their surge of external expansion.SA s top 20 companies have about $4.99 trillion (R18.6 trillion) in foreign assets.These were the observations of the School of Economics of the North West University (NWU) and the Columbia Centre on Sustainable Investment (CCSI), a joint centre of Columbia Law School and The Earth Institute at Columbia University in New York, in releasing the results of the first survey of South African multinationals last week. The report was compiled by Prof Henri Bezuidenhout and Jacob van Rensburg.SA business has been criticised for hoarding cash or spending it abroad instead of at home.During Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan s roadshow in New York last year when he met international investors, it emerged that South African companies abroad were sitting on a pile cash estimated between R700bn and R900bn.Locally, the corporate cash pile has hit new highs of about R700bn, pointing to lack of confidence in the local economy as companies prefer to bank their money rather than risk it on expansion.The survey revealed that as at financial year end 2015, the 20 foremost South African non-financial multinational enterprises (MNEs) had a total of nearly $50bn in foreign assets, almost $49bn in foreign sales and more than 220000 employees abroad.Sasol leads the way with $9bn in foreign assets, followed by recently expanding retail giant Steinhoff with $8.7bn and mining kingpin Goldfields with $5.4bn. These three firms, with the addition of MTN and AngloGold Ashanti dominate the list, accounting for more than two-thirds of the asset share.Mining four firms was the largest contributing sector, accounting for 23% of foreign assets, followed by retail 20%, also four firms and energy and chemicals (18%, solely Sasol). The majority of South African MNEs are driven by horizontal, or market-seeking foreign direct investment (FDI).For these firms to increase their market share, expansion occurs in roughly similar foreign markets compared to the domestic market, as growth prospects are attractive.Hence, the geographical footprint of South African MNEs is primarily present in sub-Saharan Africa.Of the more than 1000 foreign affiliates controlled by the top 20 firms, 443 reside in sub-Saharan Africa, while continental Europe is next in line with 225 foreign affiliates.All of the top 20 MNEs are publicly owned and listed on the JSE, with seven firms also having secondary, or more, listings on foreign stock exchanges.Notable listings include all three gold-mining entities, Goldfields, AngloGold and Harmony Gold, being listed on the New York Stock Exchange.Executively, South Africa s top 20 MNEs still have a predominantly South African feel to them, with 81% of the board members being locals. Only three firms, Sasol, Sappi and Datatec, are headed by a foreigner. As is the case in many South African firms, the directors are predominantly men.FDI flows and stock have increased considerably since the turn of the century, notably due to SA s trade liberalisation since the abolition of apartheid.The top 20 MNEs have operations in a combined 502 countries and although the list is expanding, many other local MNEs not found in the top 20 are also increasing their foreign stakeholdings.Recent political and economic events in the country, having three finance ministers in one week and the ever evolving possibility of being downgraded to junk status by the credit ratings agencies,- have been of an unsupportive nature for many of SA s top MNEs.Not only is foreign investment outflows anticipated to increase, many firms might even contemplate setting up their corporate offices abroad, with more pressure resulting from the passing of new investment legislation. Further issues such as political risk, unreliable electricity supply and B-BBEE are also of concern.Many are fretful of political risk being a core hindering factor in doing business. Also of note is the uncertainty regarding the supply of electricity.Another contributing factor is the apparent brain drain being experienced. This is further enhanced by the implementation of the government s B-BBEE policy aiding to speed up transformation in the country.Sello Rabothata| sellor@thenewage.co.za
