Black soldiers who volunteered in World War 1 were internationalists who loved peace and justice, President Jacob Zuma said while praising soldiers who were on board the SS Mendi when it sank.Zuma was speaking at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on Tuesday, in celebration of Armed Forces Day. Black people had volunteered to join world war in order to fight fascism. They were ahead of their time. They were internationalists who loved peace and justice.They also joined the war believing that their contribution would lead to better treatment back at home after the war by the colonial masters. Unfortunately their sacrifice did not earn them any respect by the rulers of the time, Zuma said.The SS sank 100 years ago, carrying over 800 servicemen of which many of them were Africans. The boat was carrying 616 South Africans and 607 of them were black troops.It is reported that the ship sank for 20 minutes on the 21st of February 1917, and that it almost broke in half after being struck by a smaller vessel.The President told scores of people and soldiers who attended the event that black soldiers who participated in World War 1 were not allowed to carry weapons.He said however that soldiers on the SS Mendi needed more recognition.&#8220;They were not decorated or awarded any medals after the war. That is the history that we come from. A history of brutal and blatant racism and colonialism, the President added.He further said that he saluted all men in the Mendi because they promoted unity of the South African people.The President alluded that government had travelled to France last year to pay tribute to those who fell in Deville Wood, to ensure that black South Africa soldiers were honoured and recognised in the monument in France.Zuma also thanked all soldiers on behalf of the country for making sure that they always answer to the call when they have to serve the country.&#8220;We thank you for answering the call to serve. We have full confidence in you,&#8221; Zuma reiterated.As a sign of respect and remembrance for the fallen soldiers, President Zuma also laid a wreath.-Sipho Jack
