A bank employee has been granted R5000 bail with strict conditions and is expected back in court on 9 February to face charges of fraud. Ntobeko Mbolekwa, 33, made a brief appearance in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court in Cape Town after he was arrested by the Hawks’ serious commercial crime unit last week for alleged fraud. It is alleged that Mbolekwa manipulated the bank system and created new internet banking profiles for an account belonging to an FNB client in Hout Bay. Captain Lloyd Ramovha said Mbolekwa authorised bank cards on the account and enabled fraudulent transfers into various bank accounts, resulting in the client losing R1.2 million. “An internal forensic probe by the bank was initiated after the client lodged a complaint. The Hawks were roped in for further investigations resulting in Mbolekwa’s arrest while he was on duty,” Ramovha said. Ramovha said Mbolekwa would face charges of fraud, money laundering and contravention of the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act. -TNA Reporter
