The Department of Education in the Eastern Cape has expressed shock and condemned the actions of a principal in Mdantsane who allegedly forced school children to admit that they are lesbians or gay in front of parents.Provincial education spokesperson Malibongwe Mtima said they are astonished by the Principal&#8217;s behaviour.&#8220;We have opted to send our officials for the special programmes unit to go and conduct advocacy campaigns and implement programmes that sensitise staff members about the rights of gays, lesbians and transgender and bisexual learners,&#8221; said Mtimka.&#8220;We are obligated to implement a program of advocacy campaigns that teach staff members relating to the right of women and people with disabilities including children,&#8221; Mtima said.It is reported that the Ulwazi High School principal Nomampondomise Kosani called the group of 38 school learners, aged 14 to 18, together and forced them, in front of the teens parents, guardians and teachers, to point out their girlfriends.This after she found two girls kissing in a bathroom. Kosani allegedly sent them all home with a letter which ordered them to return with their parents.Astounded parents had to experience their kids admitting if they are lesbian/gay or not.One parent who refused to be named told Daily Dispatch that the behaviour was unnecessary and that her child was too young to decide on the sexual Orientation.&#8220;We had a meeting a week ago by the provincial government and commission on gender quality and we raised the issue of schools where their rights are being violated and We are hoping that such intervention will continue,&#8221; said Mtima.Even though Kosani refused to speak to the media saying that the problems of the school are not for media, parents still feel that she could have handled the matter differently. a Parent told Daily Dispatch As shocked as I was with learning my child was gay, I still think that there could have been better ways to handle this situation.&#8221; The parent said they were embarrassed on behalf of the child &#8220;who was made to stand up and disclose her orientation.&#8221; Thembelani Ndlovu the spokesperson of the South African Teachers Council said the behaviour is uncalled for. &#8220;Sexual Orientation cannot be used as discriminatory and our belief is that calling a group of learners to discuss a problem which should be private is wrong,&#8221; Ndlovu said. &#8220;Whatever sexual orientation of an individual is a choice and the school is the environment where these things cannot be touched and where a child is expected to learn,&#8221; Ndlovu said. He said &#8220;If the parent feels that their children have been abused or violated they have a right to go and speak to civil claim but we cannot source that as the council.&#8221;TNA Reporter
