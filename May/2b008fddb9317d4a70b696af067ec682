Manchester United will field a weakened team for their last Premier League game of the season against Crystal Palace if they qualify for the Europa League final, manager Jose Mourinho has said.Fifth-placed United are a point and a place behind Manchester City and their qualification for next season&#8217;s Champions League through a top-four finish depends on either City or third-placed Liverpool slipping up in their remaining games.With four league matches left, United are yet to play second-placed Tottenham Hotspur and sixth-placed Arsenal but can also book a Champions League spot by winning the Europa League.They face Spanish side Celta Vigo away in the semi-final first leg on Thursday.&#8220;If we beat Celta, we have the final (on May 24) and, in this moment, it is obviously hypothetical,&#8221; Mourinho told the club&#8217;s website. (www.manutd.com)&#8221;The Europa League final is on the Wednesday and we play against Crystal Palace on the Sunday&#8230; so we would be playing the final with disastrous consequences,&#8221; the Portuguese added.&#8220;Maybe I can bring (youth team coach) Nicky Butt and his team to play against Crystal Palace and hopefully they (Palace) don&#8217;t need the game to stay in the division because it would be very, very bad if they needed the points and we played with the Under-23s.&#8221;Midfielders Paul Pogba and Marouane Fellaini will return to action against Celta.&#8220;Fellaini and Pogba will be back for that game so there are a little bit more in terms of options so we will give everything we have,&#8221; Mourinho said.
