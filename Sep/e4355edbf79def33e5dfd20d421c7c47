KWAITO star Mandoza (Mduduzi Tshabalala), who died of nasopharyngeal carcinoma on September 18, last year was honoured by his wife, Mpho Tshabalala, who launched the Mandoza Foundation.The launch was held at Charlotte Maxeke Hospital s oncology ward where Mandoza was treated before his death. Speaking at the launch, Tshabalala said she was determined to fight the disease that continues to affect South Africans and the world at large. These are my people (cancer patients). Mduduzi died fighting cancer and that is our mission. We will fight this cancer together, she said. She said the foundation would encourage early detection testing for people living in townships. I am determined to use my experiences to help others. Most black people seem to think cancer is for white people only, she said.siyabongas@thenewage.co.za-Siyabonga Sithole
