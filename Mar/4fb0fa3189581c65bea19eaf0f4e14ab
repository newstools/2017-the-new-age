The African Diaspora Forum (ADF) said it is shocked by utterances made by Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba about undocumented immigrants in the country.In an Interview with Bloomberg on Wednesday, Mashaba vowed that the City will not accommodate people who do not have the right documentation. One thing is for sure is that the city cannot under any circumstance accommodate undocumented people from anywhere, Mashaba reiterated.The Mayor said, having undocumented immigrants in the city resulted in buildings being high jacked by criminal elements, adding that they ended up being involved in drugs and prostitution.African Diaspora Forum Deputy Public Relations Officer Gugulethu Ncube said: We are shocked at the same time we are not shocked. What can you expect from somebody who s like Herman Mashaba whom we tried to interact with and requested him to retract a previous statement he made, Ncube added.She said the centre knew that Mashaba was going to repeat the same statements which incite violence.In December last year, the Mayor had publicly called on foreigners to leave his city and almost declaring that all foreigners were criminals.He also blamed government s inability to deal with crime in the country, as one of the reason why the city was inundated with undocumented immigrants.Mashaba further said the country s borders&#8217; inadequacy in dealing with high number of foreigners coming into the country, made it difficult for him to govern. We have allowed our country to have open borders. Why our national government allowed this to happen is beyond me. It s unfortunate that Johannesburg is the biggest city in the country and when they lock in the country, the first city they go to is Johannesburg,&#8221; Mashaba said.Meanwhile, the African National Congress (ANC) had condemned, Mashaba s utterances, saying that his comments had preceded the spate of attacks on foreigners. The ANC notes the bitter irony of the political opposition the Democratic Alliance condemning xenophobic violence in Gauteng when it was the reckless statements of Mayor Mashaba that lit the tinderbox of hatred in the first place, ANC SPOKESPERSON Zizi Kodwa said.However Mayoral committee spokesperson in February said Tony Taverna-Turisan said Mashaba welcomed foreigners to the city and believed they had a role in growing the economy. At the same time, we will not accept lawlessness in our city and the rule of law must be maintained. We will not retract our views that everyone who is here should be here lawfully, Taverna-Turisan said.-TNA Reporter
