Tomorrow throngs of dignitaries as well as musicians will gather at Malamulele Stadium to honour former minister of public service and administration Collins Chabane who died in a freak car accident in 2015 with the first annual Collins Chabane Cultural Heritage Festival.More than 40 traditional leaders, MPs, artists and thousands of music fans and people from the greater Limpopo community are expected to attend this musical and cultural extravaganza aimed at kicking off heritage month. Chabane will be remembered for his passion for traditional music, which was second to his love of politics.Among those set to entertain music lovers with their spirited performances include traditional Pedi traditional singer and dancer Candy Tsamandebele, dance music sensation, King Monada, Tsonga disco musicians such as Benny Mayerngani, Joe Shirimani, and gospel singer Rofhiwa Manyanga.Besides being a politician, he was also revered for playing the harmonica and being a professional musician who released two CDs with Movement, his traditional music group.Formerly known as Vuma Concert, and recently rebranded to Collins Chabane Cultural Heritage Festival, festival organiser and managing director for Kincha Media, King Chauke said has team saw it fit to rebrand the event to honour Chabane s legacy. Chabane had a great love for music and made a tremendous contribution to the industry, as many know. What better way to honour him than to hold a cultural music festival in his name, celebrating the diversity our country has through indigenous music, he said.The festival seeks to promote the rich culture and diversity of South Africa as to open the market for different talents. We look forward to being the number one event in Limpopo and we are all geared up to put together a memorable event in partnership with the National Lotteries Commission and the National Arts Council, Chauke said. We named the event after a giant and are under pressure to represent what the late minister stood for. SIMANGELE LEGODI
