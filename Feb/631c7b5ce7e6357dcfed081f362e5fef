Former world number one Tiger Woods has withdrawn from the EPGA Dubai Desert Classic before the start of Friday&#8217;s second round due to a back injury.A back spasm overnight failed to subside forcing the 14-time major winner to concede he could not compete as his comeback struggles continue.The 41-year-old Woods shot a five-over par 77 on Thursday but insisted he wasn&#8217;t in any pain. &#8220;No, I wasn&#8217;t in pain at all. I was just trying to hit shots and I wasn&#8217;t doing a very good job,&#8221; the American said.His manager Mark Steinberg told reporters in Dubai that it wasn&#8217;t the nerve issue that kept Woods out of the game for 16 months before his return late last year, but back spasms.&#8221;He felt okay coming off the golf course yesterday (Thursday). So he wasn&#8217;t in pain. I didn&#8217;t see him at dinner, but he said he was okay,&#8221; explained Steinberg.&#8220;He then went into a spasm in his lower back, fairly late last night after dinner.&#8221;He tried to work it out last night. Didn&#8217;t really get it worked out. Had treatment starting pretty early this morning, for probably the past three, three-and-a-half hours, and he can&#8217;t get the spasm to settle.&#8220;He says it&#8217;s not the nerve pain that&#8217;s kept him out for so long. He says it&#8217;s a back spasm and he just can&#8217;t get the spasm to calm down. So that&#8217;s where we are.&#8221;He talked to Matthew (Fitzpatrick) and Danny (Willett), and he feels terrible for the tournament.&#8220;He can move around. But he can&#8217;t make a full rotation on the swing.&#8221;Woods was scheduled to take a week off after Dubai and then play two successive weeks on the PGA Tour - at the Genesis Open and Honda Classic.But Steinberg did not comment about Woods&#8217; status for those two tournaments.&#8220;I think spasms are a funny thing. I&#8217;m certainly no doctor but they come and go. And again, the fact that he feels as though it&#8217;s not the nerve pain, that&#8217;s very encouraging for him,&#8221; he added.&#8221;He&#8217;s had some spasms before. No doubt about it. But he&#8217;s got to get the spasm to calm down from what I gather. He has his trainer here, which is good, and that&#8217;s who has been working on him for the past several hours.&#8220;So yeah, he&#8217;ll get it to calm down, and forget about the long term; the short-term prognosis, he hopes he&#8217;ll be strong; based on the fact that it&#8217;s not that nerve pain I just alluded to.&#8221;Woods, now languishing down in 666 in the world rankings, saw his long-awaited PGA Tour comeback come to an abrupt end at the Farmers Insurance Open last week as he tumbled out of the tournament after missing the cut.-AFP
