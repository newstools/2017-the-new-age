Transformation of the automotive industry could lead to an advanced and inclusive growth of the manufacturing sector and is therefore not negotiable, Minister of Trade and Industry Dr Rob Davies said at an automotive component show in Durban yesterday.He told the inaugural National Association of Automotive Component and Allied Manufacturers (Naacam) show at the Durban ICC that transformation would ensure the automotive industry was in line with national demographics. While discussions are continually unfolding on developing and growing the domestic automotive component industry towards its objectives of higher levels of localisation, employment creation and improved competitiveness, Davies said its transformation was as important and non-negotiable. This industry is vital to South Africa s industrialisation, specifically and, most importantly, to the manufacturing sector of the economy. The industry s contribution to gross domestic production is estimated at 7.5% with 113000 people directly employed in the vehicle assembly and components supply industry, Davies said.-SELLO RABOTHATA|sellor@thenewage.co.za
