In his state of the nation address tabled in the joint sitting of Parliament in February this year, President Jacob Zuma said: Today we are beginning a new chapter of radical transformation. The state will play a role in the economy to drive that transformation. Radical economic transformation, or inclusive growth, is defined as fundamental change in the structure, systems, institutions and patterns of ownership, management and control of the economy in favour of all South Africans, especially the poor, the majority of whom are African and female .In 2015, the fourth national general council (NGC) of the governing ANC resolved as follows: To ensure more effective radical economic transformation, we have to build a more capable and effective state, which has the technical and political capacity to lead development and transform the economy .Radical economic transformation is therefore not a theory developed for convenience. It is a mandate given to us, and it must happen. The Free State province will ensure the implementation of this noble programme.On the October 19, 2016, the Free State executive council adopted a comprehensive radical economic transformation programme which will run until 2019, when the term of office of the present administration comes to an end.The programme identified land, state assets, state property and municipal infrastructure grants, among others, as key pillars to unlock the capability of the regional economy towards inclusive growth.On April 25, 2017 Zuma, officially launched the Maluti-a-Phofung special economic zone (MAP SEZ), which is situated in the eastern Free State town of Harrismith in the Maluti-a-Phofung local municipality.By launching this initiative, the president increased the impetus towards the transformation of the economy.The project s estimated investment injection of R2.6bn over five years, as well as more than 22000 expected employment opportunities are expected to primarily benefit the poor, youth, women as well as enterprises and individuals from local communities.Through the capacity of the project to enhance employment creation, industrialization and export of value-added commodities, the SEZ will contribute positively towards radical socio-economic transformation.The Xhariep solar plant investment is another project which is intended to directly change the structure of economic production in the Xhariep district in particular, by diversifying the energy production mix, while creating jobs and enhancing inclusive growth.The solar plant will see a huge injection in the regional economy of Xhariep, the province s poorest district, and will provide relief to the people in the area.To further enhance the potential of the project to transform the economy, the provincial government will establish effective and efficient government offices and service centres in Kopanong municipality, where the solar plant project will be based. The R60m industrial park was launched in Botshabelo on June 14, 2016.The project guarantees programmes and related incentives in the manufacturing sector in order to influence the transformation of the economy and create jobs. The youth, women and local communities stand to benefit immensely from this project.The Free State cabinet has also approved a Nine Point Plan for radical transformation. The plan also highlights a detailed plan on education and skills development, which are preconditions for radical economic transformation.In addition to more than 7500 students funded by the Free State government in various universities in the country, the province has also sent more than 1000 students to pursue various undergraduate and postgraduate studies at universities in countries like Cuba, China, Russia, Portugal, Turkey, Belarus and others. The Nine Point Plan links nine priority areas to education and skills development, and shows how those can enhance radical economic transformation.As part of measuring the implementation of the radical economic transformation programme, the provincial government regularly investigates its procurement patterns to assess whether the motive forces, namely, the youth, women, rural enterprises, cooperatives and business people with disabilities, are benefitting from the government s procurement spend.The Free State government is convinced that radical economic transformation shall reduce unemployment, poverty and unemployment in the province.The Free State government shall continue to work with all stakeholders, including but not limited to, labour unions, business, NGOs, political and social formations, the international community and all other stakeholders to achieve radical economic transformation.In this year, the year of ex-president Oliver Reginald Tambo, we will accelerate and intensify our resolve to make a meaningful contribution in ensuring that the wealth of this country is shared among all our people, black and white.Ace MagashuleAce Magashule is the Free State ANC chairperson and Premier
