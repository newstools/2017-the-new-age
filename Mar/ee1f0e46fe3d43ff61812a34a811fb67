Insure Channel Life has been ordered to pay R7500 to a client for distress suffered as a result of delays in paying out a claim.The order by the ombudsman for long-term insurance, judge Ron McLaren, came after the insurance company was lambasted for how it handled a claim submitted in 2013.The family of the unidentified deceased submitted its claim on December 13, 2013 after the insured person died on November 4 of the same year.According to the ombud s office, Channel Life then asked the attorneys who were handling the deceased s estate on no fewer than five occasions to submit the same set of documents .The documents were requested even though they had been submitted to the insurer on February 24, 2014.McLaren criticised the insurance company for poorly handling the claim.The ombud found that the widow of the insured suffered tremendously as a result of the delay.Ruling on the matter, the ombudsman said: Channel Life s approach to the administration of the claim was lackadaisical. The complainant had suffered material inconvenience and distress as a result of Channel Life s maladministration of the claim. The office of the ombudsman had seldom seen such a poor level of service. It said that asking for the same documents on numerous occasions contributed in delaying the process unnecessarily. The information on file confirmed that Channel Life was in receipt of all the claim requirements on June 18 ,2014. Channel Life s repeated requests, over a long period of time, for documentation already in its possession, delayed the claim unnecessarily, the ombud s office said.After paying out the balance of the claim in June 2016, Channel Life informed the complainant that no interest would be paid on the claim, saying the delay was caused by the outstanding claim requirements being submitted late by the executor of the estate .However, it agreed to pay interest calculated from June 18, 2014 after a complaint was lodged with the ombudsman s office.The insurance company has complied with the order. 701233-TNA Reporter
