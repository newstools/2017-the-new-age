President Donald Trump vowed Tuesday to introduce a new merit-based system to regulate new arrivals in the United States and reduce the flow of unskilled workers, as he held out the prospect of a sweeping immigration reform.While pushing for tougher law enforcement in his maiden speech to Congress, Trump also said an Australian-style immigration system would &#8220;save countless dollars, raise workers&#8217; wages, and help struggling families &#8212; including immigrant families &#8212; enter the middle class.&#8221;&#8220;It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially,&#8221; Trump told lawmakers.&#8220;Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon,&#8221; he added.Trump held out the prospect of achieving a bipartisan compromise on immigration reform, something that has eluded previous US administrations.&#8220;I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation&#8217;s security, and to restore respect for our laws,&#8221; he said.Trump tied his pledge to fight illegal immigration to the prospect of jobs and security at home.&#8220;By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars and make our communities safer for everyone,&#8221; he said.He said he had given orders to create a special office to assist victims of crime by immigrants. It will be called VOICE &#8212; Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement.&#8220;We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests,&#8221; Trump said.He then paid tribute to four guests in the audience, who, he said, had lost loved ones in violent crimes committed by immigrants living in the country illegally.-AFP
