The Department of Higher Education and Training has urged prospective students of private colleges to remain vigilant and to verify the accreditation of institutions before deciding to enroll. The warning came amid investigations into the owners of a suspected fraudulent international university for operating an illegal private institution in central Pretoria. This came after several complaints from prospective students and the public regarding the Shepherd Bushiri University. The department spokesperson Madikwe Mabotha said the institution was not registered with the relevant quality assurer, the Quality Council for Trades and Occupations. “Preliminary investigations have established that the institution is not registered with the department as either a private college or private higher education institution as required by law,” Mabotha said. She said the department had since sent a warning letter to the institution’s operators instructing them to cease operations with immediate effect. “The department treats this case seriously and has approached law enforcement authorities to assist with further investigations,” Mabatho said. Shepherd Bushiri’s publicist, Allegro Dinkwanyane, confirmed that they are aware of the investigations by the department. She said the university was not yet operating in South Africa under Shepherd Bushiri’s name but it would be doing so once its paperwork was completed. “For now, we are offering short theology courses operating under the Tshwane University of Technology. “The registrations started at the beginning of this year,” Dinkwanyane said. A total of 21 cases have been formally lodged with the South African Police Service in the past four years to investigate suspicions of unlawful practices in the private higher education sector. The pending cases were reported between 2012 and 2017 and are at different levels of investigation with the SAPS. SHONISANI TSHIKALANGE and MPHO KOBELI news@thenewage.co.za
