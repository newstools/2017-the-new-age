A well-known Eastern Cape pastor stands accused of sexual abuse by some of his flock.And the Hawks are now inquiring into the allegations.The 44-year-old stands accused of taking advantage of scores of women in his church, with some going as far as making allegations of sexual abuse against him.According to Daily Dispatch prophet Mndayi Njengele has a following in Cape Town, Keiskammahoek, King William s Town, East London, Port Elizabeth, Mthatha and his home town, Dutywa.It is said that a group of about 20 women from the church organised a WhatsApp group where they speak about their experiences with the pastor.Unconfirmed reports say that these women were turned away when they went to report the matter in the nearest police station.One of his victims, a woman who refused to be named, said she has been manipulated by the prophet to leave her husband.She said Njengele had then asked that she be physically removed from the church after allegedly calling her a witch and a seducer.Hawks spokesperson Anelisa Feni said there was an inquiry into the matter.&#8220;It is just an inquiry at this stage, not the full investigation,&#8221; said Feni. When there is an investigation we don t give full details,we give out information once there is arrest because it could compromise our investigation,&#8221; she said.The church, which has nine branches nationwide, headlines in January for claiming to cure HIV/AIDS. This is just another way God is trying to spread the gospel about our church, because if there weren t any negative rumours, the media would not have any interest in me and my church. Nobody can question God s plan, Njengele is reported to have responded.TNA Reporter
