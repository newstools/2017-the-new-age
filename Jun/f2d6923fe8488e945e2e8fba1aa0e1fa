Justice Minister Mike Masutha has welcomed the decision by the Supreme Court of Appeals not to allow live broadcast media coverage of the Henri van Breda murder trial.The appeal was lodged by the National Director of Public Prosecutions at the SCA after Media 24 successfully filed an application in the Western Cape High Court.The SCA ruled a request to broadcast a criminal trial should be decided by the trial court on a case by case basis after a proper application has been brought before it.Van Breda is facing three counts of murder, one of attempted murder and one of obstructing the ends of justice.His parents, Martin, 54, and Teresa, 55, and brother Rudi, 22, were axed to death in their home on the De Zalze golf estate in Stellenbosch early on January 27, 2015.He handed himself over to the police in June and was granted bail of R100000 on June 14. His sister Marli, 18, survived the attack but was severely injured.Advocate Michael Masutha said he welcomed the balancing act demonstrated by the SCA in terms of the right to a fair trial versus media freedom and the right to know, as well as the jurisprudence it sought to establish through this judgment. The appeal by the NPA sought to protect witnesses testifying in criminal matters so that they give evidence in a manner free of the scrutiny that may be caused by a live broadcast of their testimony. The courts are duty bound to consider each application carefully by upholding the decorum of the court and ensuring fair administration of justice. The court ruled careful consideration must be given to the objection of an accused to the presence of cameras in the courtroom, striking a constitutionally appropriate balance between policies favouring public access to court proceedings and the accused s right to a fair trial and ensuring that such rights are not prejudiced.Media24 was backing up its application to live stream the trial with section 16 of the Constitution, which guarantees certain rights to freedom of expression, freedom of the media and the right of access to information.nondumisoz@thenewage.co.za
