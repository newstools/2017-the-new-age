The auditing company KPMG says it will make a R40 million donation to various NGOs.This comes after the company exonerated most of the staff at KPMG from acting illegally with regard to the Gupta-family businesses.The company had also announced that it has withdrawn its findings into the so-called rogue unit .This unit aimed at investigating high-profile tax evasion was set up during Pravin Gordhan when he was Sars commissioner. The unit was criticised for using surveillance only reserved for the intelligence services.KPAMG s CEO Trevor Hoole also resigned on Friday and eight other senior employees. Their resignations are seen as the first casualty of pressure by civil society and business to disassociate themselves with Gupta-owned companies.Former Sars spokesperson Adrian Lackay meanwhile says many others were affected by this report. None of the affected people, from 2015 until now, have been given a fair and reasonable opportunity by KPMG to refute the findings. Where is the justice and compensation for those who were really affected, Lackay said.Meanwhile, the interim chief operating officer Andrew Cranston said they were only the doers and the company would repay all the money they had made from the Gupta family back to SA. To be clear, the evidence in the documentation provided to KPMG South Africa does not support the interpretation that Mr. Gordhan knew, or ought to have known, of the rogue nature of this unit, it said. KPMG South Africa has contacted SARS and offered to repay the R23m fee received for the extensive work performed, or to make a donation for the same amount to charity.SANCO&#8217;s Spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu says they are not happy with the resignation of the nine executives including its Chief Executive Officer, Trevor Hoole. He further said theseHe further said these were an indication of a wider private sector involvement in corruption and other activities that undermine good corporate governance and those that contributed towards credit downgrades by international credit rating agencies. Unless they are also captured or are narrowly serving the interests of the beneficiaries of institutionalized corruption, state security agencies need to explain to the country why it should still have confidence in them because state capture allegations point to their conspicuous disinterest in protecting the sovereignty and interest of the broader South African public, Mahlangu said.-TNA Reporter&nbsp;&nbsp;
