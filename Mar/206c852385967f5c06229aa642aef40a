Rihanna never went to college but the R&amp;B superstar voiced delight as she was presented an award by Harvard University for her humanitarian work.&#8220;So I made it to Harvard! Never thought I would be able to say that in my life, but it feels good,&#8221; a beaming Rihanna said to students&#8217; cheers at the prestigious US university Tuesday evening.Harvard named the 29-year-old singer its Humanitarian of the Year, pointing to her projects that include an advanced center to treat breast cancer in her native Barbados and support for girls&#8217; education around the developing world.Rihanna said she had set up her first charity at age 18 and remarked: &#8220;People make it seem way too hard, man.&#8221;&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to be rich to help someone, you don&#8217;t need to be famous, you don&#8217;t even need to be college-educated,&#8221; she said, while joking that she wished she were.&#8220;I want to challenge each of you to make a commitment to help one person, one organization, one situation that touches your heart,&#8221; she said.&#8220;My grandmother always used to say, &#8216;If you got a dollar, there&#8217;s plenty to share.'&#8221;Rihanna, who was discovered by a music executive while still a teenager, has also set up a scholarship program named after her grandparents for Caribbean students in the United States.-AFP
