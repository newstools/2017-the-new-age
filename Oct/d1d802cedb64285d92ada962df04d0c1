Professor Malegapuru Makgoba took to the stand again  on day two at the Life Esidimeni Arbitration hearing,  testifying on the contents of his report into circumstances surrounding the deaths of over a hundred psychiatric patients. The patients died following their chaotic moves from Life Esidimeni into 27 illegal NGOs across the province. Makgoba agreed with Counsel for some of the patients, Dirk Groenewald,  that patients’ human rights were violated. He testified that many families were not informed about  where their loved ones had been moved to. “For almost a year he (Reverend) didn’t know where his son was. I can say that for a number of these families they did not know where their loved ones are,” he said. The ombudsman said both families and patients were not treated with common courtesy, human dignity and human respect. “Some patients had to be tied because the transport used was not appropriate and some were moved from one NGO to the next,” he testified. Responding to  Justice Moseneke’s question about why  former MEC Qedani Mahlangu had pushed forward on with the project despite  many warning, the Ombudsman said: “I never got an answer, it bothered me so much, but I never got it,” he said. Makgoba’s testimony continues.  LERATO DIALE
