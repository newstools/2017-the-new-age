Former beauty queen, TV presenter and actress Michelle Molatlou has died. Molatlou succumbed to her battle with cervical cancer on Tuesday at the National Hospital in Bloemfontein. Michelle Molatlou was an amazing all-rounder. From being crowned Miss Black South Africa to playing lead roles in SABC dramas, then magazines and advertising… Always reinventing herself. Always elegantly brilliant. Always beautiful. What a sad loss.  #RIPMichelleMolatlou — Mme a Masakona (@FloMasebe) December 19, 2017 Read the statement from the family posted by blogger Phil Mphela below: TV: Former actress, tv personality and beauty queen, Michelle Molatlou, has passed on.
