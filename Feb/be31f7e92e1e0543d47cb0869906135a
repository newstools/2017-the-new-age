TO SUPPORT teaching and learning of science in schools, the University of the Western Cape (UWC) and its partners opened a 40th science centre this week.UWC s partnership with the Garden Cities Archway Foundation and the provincial education department opened four newly constructed science learning centres on Tuesday, to support teaching and learning of school science in the Eden and Central Karoo education district. The new centres bring the total to 40 science centre s to date.UWC, whose mission is to improve science at primary and high schools across the country, made it known that the performance of pupils and teachers in national and international benchmark tests painted a bleak picture that pointed to a national education crisis. Developing a culture of science teaching and learning will be a good start to improve the NSC (National Senior Certificate) and other assessments, UWC Science Learning Centre for Africa director Prof Shaheed Hartley said. We have to start with the basics supporting teachers to have the confidence to teach science with an advanced level of understanding, knowledge and teaching skills. Similarly, we have to be creative in providing pupils with opportunities that will draw their interest and willingness to learn. UWC rector and vice-chancellor Prof Tyrone Pretorius, the CEO of Garden Cities Archway Foundation, John Matthews, and principals of the respective schools opened the centres at Murray High School in Plettenberg Bay, Percy Mdala High School in Knysna, Tyholora Primary School in George and Garden Route Primary School in Mossel Bay.The centres are equipped with smart boards and microscopes. They were constructed to give support and training to science teachers, to get pupils involved in science activities and to allow teachers and pupils to work in a safe environment.UWC s initiative has won several awards since its inception in 2011. Organisations and funders who want to contribute to the initiative have been asked to contact Hartley. Having a confident and knowledgeable science teacher in a conducive environment provided by the UWC science learning centres is a step in the right direction, he said. Interested persons should call 021 959 2680 for more information.NADINE FORD-KRITZINGER
