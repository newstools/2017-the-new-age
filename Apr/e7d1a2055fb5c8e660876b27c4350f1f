A Turkish government minister on Tuesday blasted the European Union&#8217;s &#8220;unacceptable&#8221; appeal for a probe into alleged irregularities in the referendum on boosting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan&#8217;s powers.&#8220;Such a speculative statement from a spokesperson cannot be accepted,&#8221; Turkey&#8217;s EU Affairs Minister Omer Celik told reporters at a televised press conference, calling on the EU to &#8220;respect democratic processes&#8221;.His comments came after Brussels urged Ankara to probe claims of irregularities in Sunday&#8217;s vote which resulted in a narrow win for the &#8216;Yes&#8217; camp on the controversial constitutional changes.&#8220;We call on the Turkish authorities to consider the next steps very carefully, and to seek the broadest possible national consensus in the follow-up to the national referendum,&#8221; European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said at a press conference in Brussels.International observers charged Monday that the referendum campaign was conducted on an &#8220;unlevel playing field&#8221; and that the vote count was marred by late procedural changes that removed key safeguards.Celik slammed the report by the international observers as &#8220;groundless&#8221; and &#8220;far from maturity&#8221;.The OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) monitors &#8220;exceeded their limits,&#8221; he said.-AFP
