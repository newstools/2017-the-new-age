The undivided attention given to education is absolutely understandable considering what the first democratic president of the Republic of South Africa once said about what has been happening at our universities.The late iconic Nelson Mandela said: Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. Without a doubt, education is the key to eliminating gender inequality, to reducing poverty, to creating a sustainable planet, to preventing needless deaths and illness, and to fostering peace.It often serves as a gateway to a healthy lifestyle and a future for those trapped in abject poverty.And as a servant of the public, I see the start of 2017 as an opportune time to remind every South African about opportunities available through the post-school education policy, as well as the importance of pushing for transformation in our institutions.The post-school education and training system is aimed at addressing the needs of individual citizens, employers in both public and private sectors, as well as broader societal and developmental objectives.The opportunities are available at community level, with adult education opportunities, vocational colleges, universities of technology and academic universities of higher education as well as innovation hubs, often linked to industries.The government is committed to providing quality, accessible, affordable, and diverse post-school education. It also endeavours to ensure that academically capable and financially needy South Africans can access postschool education and training.The Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) demonstrated that when it redoubled its efforts to ensure support going forward for those who cannot afford to pay fees.The department provided R1.9bn of the R2.3bn shortfall resulting from the agreement on the no-fee increase for 2016.Further to that, DHET set aside more than R5.7bn over the 2016-17 to 2018-19 period to universities to ensure that the fee freeze in 2016 did not lead to unmanageable fee increases in the future.Another R4.57bn was allocated to the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) in 2016-17 made up of R2.54bn to ensure that 71 753 students who were not or insufficiently funded in 2013 to 2015 could pay their debts and R2.03bn to ensure that these students and poor students entering universities for the first time can study.This amounted to a whopping 47.3% increase in baseline funding for NSFAS in 2016. This, together with the other NSFAS funds, put 205 000 through university, and another 200 000 through TVET colleges.That is a total of 405 000 students receiving government support, a massive feat by any standards. However, we can only rest on our laurels at our own peril. There is still a long way to go and elements of transformation are critical.The leaders and management of all the focal points of education have a collective responsibility to open the doors of learning widely, aggressively and promoting access, as well as fostering transformation.The public discourse on #FeesMustFall clearly indicated that as a country we have to step up efforts and intervene decisively.It s also important to note that high dropout rates are not only linked to financial challenges faced by poor students, but also to a variety of frustration points, such as, curriculum, which does not talk to skills that are required by sectors driving the economies of scale and even unwritten cultures and traditions prevalent in untransformed institutions.As we start the new year, we know that a number of students will be applying outside South Africa, not because we are part of the global village, but mainly because they do not meet the criteria in our own institutions. Our institutions of education have to revisit the gender revolution.The prevalence of sexual assaults in our education landscape is also a shame and calls for systems to be developed with the assistance of experts so as to promote zero tolerance to sexual assaults in institutions of learning.We cannot turn a blind eye or normalise rape at schools and universities.We have to hold the perpetrators of these crimes accountable, name them and ensure that the victims resilience is strengthened and they are able to go through the justice system.We would not want a situation where a victim drops out of the education system because of symptoms of trauma and post-traumatic stress disorders.Arson, destruction of property and other forms of violence are unfortunate. As such acts of violence deprive students of the ability to articulate convincingly critical experiences within the education systems, which if not given undivided attention could undermine the political will and resolve to open doors of learning.It is unimaginable that property worth millions was destroyed during the fees protests. The challenge is now for the various campus administrations to find the money to repair and replace damaged property.On the other hand, the Department of Telecommunications continues to push broadband penetration across South Africa. Connecting South Africans in villages, towns, cities and suburbs to the rest of the planet through highspeed broadband will stimulate entrepreneurship and growth like no other investment. It removes distance and offers everyone a chance to secure their own economic freedom.In 2012, the World Bank calculated that a 10% increase in fixed broadband penetration in developing countries would result in a 1.35% increase in GDP growth. A more recent study found that doubling mobile data usage leads to a 0.5% increase in GDP growth.I believe the ICT revolution has the potential to transform the education landscape through offering a variety of online education and skills. Through the open government partnerships framework, the government will continue with efforts to increase skills related offerings.Prof Hlengiwe Buhle Mkhize is the Deputy Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services&nbsp;
