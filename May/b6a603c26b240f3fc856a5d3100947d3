ethical compass: Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe should not escape culpability because of the position of power that he holds in society in relation to a sex scandal that he is caught up in, despite him having apologised, says the writer. picture: Gallo Images We LEARNT during the course of time from ancient thinkers and proverbs that those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad .When society loses its ethical moorings it tends to stray, in the process becomes rudderless and so drifts into raging seas with the possibility of hitting dangerous life s icebergs.Questions such as how society knows what is right or why should it act rightly, are important and they should occupy our collective minds. When leaders lose their ethical compass, as is often the case with many of our national leaders, we should not be surprised when in similar fashion society drifts into a state of lawlessness.Those who lead have a duty to set good and ethical examples. They have a greater responsibility than the rest of society because by choice they choose to be in the public eye as public servants, and so by definition are expected to set a good example for the rest of society.When they chose to be corrupt they should not be surprised when followers resort to corrupt ways as well, as anecdotally, monkey see, monkey do .And this is not to suggest that humans lack moral agency either to do right or wrong and to be held accountable for their actions. The legal doctrine of mens rea or guilty mind, which is to suggest that humans are legally responsible for what they do for as long as they are of sound mind and choose what they do deliberately.Of course we are not in the realm of law, but this is to make a strong point that as humans and especially as public leaders, we cannot easily escape culpability when our conduct become disgraceful and unethical.There are various moral theories propounded by different moral theorists or ethicists or philosophers. But as modern people living in modern democracies the glue that bind us together is what is referred to as contractarian morality , a social contract demanding of us to join others in acting in ways that each, together with others, can reasonably and freely subscribe to for the common moral standard that complete us as humans with a common purpose of desiring to act ethically or morally.In legal terms, the legal eagles make reference to the principle of pacta sunt servanda, which is to say that we should not cause damage to others, whatever form of damage, and this may include causing injury to the self-esteem or self-worth of others.If we enter into this social contract with one another we tacitly agree that we will not hurt one another not so much because hurting others is wrong, but mainly because we are better off by not harming others and so we all enter into stable cooperation and we live peacefully with one another.Which bring me to the important point of the day relating to the sexting or text sex scandal which involves the Minister in the Presidency, Jeff Radebe. The details of the story have become known to many. They need not to be rehashed save to repeat the obvious that the minister is alleged to have sought sexual gratification derived from watching nude pictures of a 29-year-old Union Buildings staffer.The contents of the minister s SMS are lurid or tasteless, unbecoming of a senior Cabinet minister and the minister has himself said so in so many words.The second and perhaps the troubling aspect to this matter, is that the young woman is on suspension, for insubordination and for, among others, wanting to make sexual advances to the president and his deputy.In a newspaper report published this week, Radebe has apologised for his indiscretion, declaring that he is sorry. But this is a serious matter, requiring an inquiry of sort, in the same way that the young woman, Siyasanga Mbambani, will be subjected to a disciplinary hearing for her alleged misdemeanours.Radebe should not escape culpability simply because he is a minister. To apologise and to express regret is acceptable, but consistent with the labour law of this country, he too must face the music for his sordid actions.It is not good enough to wish away his serious infraction by an apology. His actions and behaviour demand a disciplinary hearing because his actions amount to sexual harassment, to use the language of labour laws. Radebe has, by admission, used his position, or even abuse it, to seek sexual favours from a younger female employee, who herself had a duty to act appropriately.It might well be that it was a question of a 64-year-old man and a 29-year-old young woman consenting to wanting to play these lurid juicy games, but we cannot turn a blind eye to the power relations at play in this lopsided game Radebe and Mbambani were playing.On the one end, there is Radebe, a Minister in the Presidency. He wields immense political power at home and abroad. On the other end of the scale, there is Mbambani, a small-time photographer, whose claim to fame in the eyes of her powerful bosses is perhaps her sexual attractiveness . Other than that, she is dispensable, after all there are millions of other unemployed female photographers who can replace her, if her disciplinary hearing finds her guilty, imposing on her the verdict of guilt which could have the consequence of dismissing her from her job.Radebe is protected by his high office in the government and as a member of the ANC national executive committee. He is less vulnerable to the possibility of losing his job.The final point to be made about this matter is that we need to treat people as they deserve. The office of the presidency is an important one. The presidency should be an arch-protector of the Bill of Rights as enshrined in our Constitution.A philosopher wrote that if we are to flourish we need to cause others to flourish as well, and grant them the power to determine their own fates .We do not achieve this objective of granting others the power to flourish by exploiting them because we hold high office, or because we are wealthy or because we are in the office of the presidency. One of the offerings of the Bill of Rights is: Everyone has inherent dignity and the right to have their dignity respected and protected. In the final analysis, we must never lose sight of the fact that those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad . There are too many of our leaders who have been made mad by the excessive political power they wield. Historian John Acton teaches us that power tends to corrupt and excessive power corrupts excessively.Jo-Mangaliso Mdhlela is a writer, commentator and head of the ANN7/TNA cadet course JO-MANGALISO MDHLELA Analysis&nbsp;
