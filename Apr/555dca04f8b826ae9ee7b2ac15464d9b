Former President Thabo Mbeki has called on the African National Congress (ANC) Members of Parliament (MPs) to put the country&#8217;s citizens first.Mbeki s plea follows members of the opposition filing for the motion of confidence against President Jacob Zuma, which is to take place next week Tuesday in Parliament.Bantu Holomisa s party United Democratic Movement (UDM) approached the Constitutional Court to force a secret ballot, citing their reason as intimidation among parliamentary members.Former president Mbeki wrote an exclusive article for The Star newspaper, imploring members of Parliament to act as the people s voice not that of their political party.Mbeki said current controversy in the ANC has imposed on the country the opportunity and obligation to better define the constitutional and moral relationship between people and their representatives.However, Deputy Minister of Tele-Communication Stella Ndabeni Abrahams said on her Facebook wall, the motion was not passed on behalf of South Africans, but it was rather tabled on behalf of political parties. A motion is moved on behalf of a political party in Parliament not on behalf of South Africans, Abrahams added.Mbeki further said he agreed with the Constitutional Court ruling, when it said members of parliament were representative of the people.Meanwhile, Speaker of Parliament Baleka Mbete has until Tuesday to submit her response to the Constitutional Court on why the motion of no confidence should not be voted via secret ballot.-Sipho Jack
