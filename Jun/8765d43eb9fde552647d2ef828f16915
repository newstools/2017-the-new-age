German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she wanted a &#8220;good agreement&#8221; for both Britain and the European Union in the Brexit negotiations that started on Monday.&#8220;For me, it is above all about the EU27 proceeding together and listening carefully to Britain&#8217;s wishes and expectations,&#8221; Merkel told a news conference after meeting Romanian President Klaus Iohannis.&#8220;And it is also about representing our own interests and progressing towards a good agreement. But it is too early to speculate about the details. I want us to reach a good agreement and this should be in the interests of both sides,&#8221; she added.-Reuters
