Last week, the SA Jewish Board of Deputies (SAJBD) vocalised its outrage about a social media post on the Holocaust by Black First Land First leader Andile Mngxitama.Mngxitama s tweet, which read: For those claiming the legacy of the Holocaust is only negative, think about the lampshades and Jewish soap was clearly a conscious and perspicacious political statement on Helen Zille s scandalous tweet on colonialism, which she posted earlier this year and which read as follows: For those claiming the legacy of colonialism was only negative, think of our independent judiciary, transport infrastructure, piped water etc .Mngxitama s tweet has been deliberately decontextualized by his detractors; this tweet was posted on the very same day that he was taking Zille to court on charges of racism related to her offensive tweet on the legacy of colonialism.Mngxitama s tweet has been purposefully misconstrued, in a bevy of dislike for this outspoken black consciousness leader and is an example of selective outrage.In my reading, the Mngxitama tweet is purposed around exposing the vileness of Zille s deeply racist post and is a keen expression of outrage against the trivialisation of the horror of both the Jewish Holocaust and the holocaust of colonialism .Through this tweet, Mngxitama has exposed a selective moral outrage which gives primacy to white pain and which is a deep affront to our contemporary political discourse.Atrocities against black people have, through the ages, been miniaturized in our history books. And still today, in societies across the world, there are daily expressions of disproportionate public outrage when atrocities are committed against whites.Especially when such acts are against those with economic might, while human violations against blacks, especially those who lack financial leverage, routinely create little fuss.The SAJBD claimed that Mngxitama s tweet was a flagrant attack on the fundamental rights to the dignity and equality of Jewish South Africans .It is reported that as many as 15 complaints have been received against Mngxitama by the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) and he is likely to face the equality court. The irony and duplicity! South African Jews, like all whites, have not been unknowing onlookers in the degradation of the human rights and dignity of black South Africans, but active culpable beneficiaries of oppressive racist regimes in this country.The irony and duplicity! There has no outcry from the SAJBD or any other prominent Jewish figures or groupings against the Zille tweet, which was an unadulterated expression of racism. I m upset they are upset, Mngxitama has said about the fervent denunciation of his tweet by white South Africans, particularly white Jewish South Africans. I want you to look at yourself, he said.But the Jewish community in South Africa is especially bad at self-reflection.The fate, fortunes, and fortitude of South African Jews have on the whole been erected on an exclusive fortress of protectionism and group solidarity, and it is an insular and inward-focused community which does not look kindly on critique from outsiders, aka non-Jews , nor does it give much currency to introspection.Born into a Jewish home in South Africa, I have reared on the creed that Jewish people were the chosen people and perhaps some genuinely feel that Jewish people should be accorded special status on the human rights and human dignity spectrum.I recall when a Jewish religious leader told me that my love for a man was ungodly and unworthy because he was neither Jewish, nor white.Of course, Jewish life matters. But why does it always seem to matter more? It is as if there is a giant billboard across our global skies with the following universally accepted logo Do not hurt, offend or upset Jewish people .Of course, the horror of the Holocaust in the 40s was a human tragedy of colossal proportion and it pierced and punctured the Jewish people, among others, with perpetual pain. But the Holocaust of relentless and unrepentant slavery, colonialism, and racism which has traumatized African people across many centuries and across continents is a giant butcher about which we seem less outraged.Perhaps the greatest political truth ever told was uttered by Steve Bantu Biko, when he said: Black man, you are on your own. As I look at myself as a white Jewish South African woman, I acknowledge that while my forefathers have been the victims of persecution, they have also been the perpetrators of gross human violations, including complicity in apartheid South Africa and apartheid Israel.I have always rejected Zionism.For me, Palestine is a stolen rather than promised land. Nelson Mandela spoke of how Israel systemically incarcerated and tortured thousands of Palestinians, contrary to the rules of international law. ANC deputy secretary-general Jesse Duarte described howIsrael has turned the occupied territories of Palestine into permanent death camps .When I participated in a local protest against the ongoing human abuses by apartheid Israel of the people of Palestine, I was physically threatened and intimidated by five armed pro-Israel security personnel.The best monument we can ever pay to the Jewish Holocaust is a daily honouring of the human rights and dignity of all, irrespective of race or religion.And we need to acknowledge where we have failed and are failing dismally today. Albert Einstein said it would be my greatest sadness to see Zionists (Jews) do to Palestinian Arabs much of what Nazis did to Jews but we have sanctioned this.We have also allowed and even facilitated gross human rights abuses in South Africa under our watch.If we do not want this to be the legacy of the SA Jewish community, we should be actively involved in stewarding in social and economic justice in South Africa and fully engaged in reparations and restitution for economic crimes committed under the holocaust of apartheid and colonialism, rather than rushing to court to still a progressive black leader for a social media post which has been incorrectly deconstructed and decontextualised.I expect to be hounded for this column because one of the Ten Commandments of the SA Jewish community seems to be thou shalt nots .If calling upon the SA Jewish community to show equal moral outrage for the horrors of other holocausts and to fight for human rights for all, earns me the title of a bad Jew, so be it. It will be a badge I wear with pride.Kim Heller is a commentator on social issues
