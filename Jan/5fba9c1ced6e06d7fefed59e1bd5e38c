Kaizer Chiefs are targeting Thulani Cream Serero who has also according to a source attracted interest from Scottish giants Glasgow Celtic.The Bafana Bafana attacking midfielder has fallen out of favour at Dutch side Ajax Armsterdam and is looking to make a move away from the Eredivisie during the present transfer window.Serero s contract with Ajax, whom he joined in 2011 from parental club, Ajax Cape Town, will end at the close of the current campaign. Reliable sources disclosed to The New Age that Serero spent the festive holidays with Chiefs duo, George Lebese and George Malukeka, in Cape Town, said the source close to Serero. His loan move to Chiefs is almost complete. He is keen to return to South Africa for a short while before going back overseas to wrap up his career. He is already friends with Lebese and Maluleka as he is trying to familiarise himself with possible teammates in the not so distant future.The 26-year-old Sowetan endured a difficult year in 2016 as he fell down the pecking order at Ajax with manager Peter Bosz preferring to give younger players a run.Before the Scottish club came into the picture, there was big interest from English Championship side Reading and Ligue 1 side Bordeaux in France.But the move to the UK hit a snag due to strict rules to obtain a work permit. The English Football Association s rules state that a player must be playing for a nation inside Fifa s top 50 in order to automatically qualify for a permit in the country and with Bafana Bafana 60th, there is no hope of him acquiring one based on that.Before going into the break, Serero was relegated to the Ajax reserve side, indicating that his stay at the club is no longer a given.Linda Ximba| news@thenewage.co.za
