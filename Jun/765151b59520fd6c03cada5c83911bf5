The strain taken by teachers due to increased administrative work and difficult working conditions have been cited as reasons for high absenteeism.This follows the release of a report by the Human Sciences Research Council titled The Health of Educators indicating that absenteeism of 20 days or more was highest among white teachers at 21.4%, those aged 18-24 years at 39.2% and those in the Northern Cape at 28.4%.The most common types of reported leave were sick leave (66.6%), leave to attend funerals (13%), special leave to care for a sick person (9.8%) as well as other special leave (18.8%).The National Professional Teachers Organisation of South Africa (Naptosa) said while absenteeism among teachers was concerning and had been happening for a while, what was most worrying was the fact that they were overworked.Naptosa executive director Basil Manuel said many teachers were often booked off due to burn out. What is in the report is not something that we did not already know. Absenteeism has spiked for some time as teachers are overworked. Looking at the white teachers you will realise that it only focused in certain areas and some schools demand more from teachers like extramural activities. Many teachers are stressed out, he said.Manuel said contrary to what is put out there, the new curriculum had not lessened the administrative load for teachers. He said based on what came out of the report, there should be more done to improve the state of psychological health of teachers.The South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu), which has often been blamed for teacher absenteeism with critics claiming that its members often stayed away from work to attend meetings, declined to be drawn on the issue of high absenteeism among white teachers in particular.The union said while being absent from class was not ideal, some teachers like those in the Northern Cape experienced travelling challenges to get to work.Sadtu spokesperson Nomusa Cembi said: The province is sparsely populated and teachers have to travel long distances to get to their workplaces. This is why we have been calling for rural allowance and incentives so teachers can easily access their work place. The report also focused on issues such as job satisfaction, where some teachers said they were thinking of a career change. The reasons for this included poor pay, the high demands of the job and overcrowding in classrooms. High in the number of those who wanted to leave the profession were black teachers and those younger than 35 years.A number of teachers, 46.8%, said their workload had increased in the past three years because of large classrooms, pupils not understanding the language used to teach, ill-discipline of pupils and the lack of teachers.The highest stress levels were experienced by those teaching in the Western Cape at 26.8% with teachers 55 and above being among the most stressed at 22.3%.LILLIAN SELAPISAlillians@thenewage.co.za
