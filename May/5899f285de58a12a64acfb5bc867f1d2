Kjell Jonevret s cheerful expression reflected the mood in the Orlando Pirates camp yesterday with the team on the verge of Nedbank Cup glory. This, after all, are the team which seem unable to finish the job they start.They have edged Golden Arrows 1-0 to reach the final and must now exorcise the Nedbank Cup demons to overcome SuperSport United when the two sides meet in a repeat of the 2015-16 Nedbank Cup final. Winning the Nedbank Cup would rank as a great achievement for a Bucs team facing exclusion from next season s top eight competition.Even though it s been difficult for Jonevret to explain the psychological shortcomings in his team, he insisted the results were not a reflection of their performances. The results are a mirror of what people think of the team and I can understand their disappointment, Jonevret said. But in all the last four league games, for example, we have created more chances than any other team. We have had more shots on target in those four games. It will be yet another testing cup final for the Soweto giants against a United team which has tormented them in knockout competitions, not to mention the 6-1 humiliation in the league. But the new-found confidence, the improving Thabo Rakhale and late-season momentum could see them past the Tshwane side when they meet in Durban on June 24. Am I sure we are going to win the final? You can never be sure in football, Jonevret said. But at least we are one step closer and we know that this should be a tough game. We ve played SuperSport once earlier this year since I arrived. It s going to be a really tough one this time around. It has been a troubled season with a lot of things that happened.I can understand that a lot of supporters and people are a little bit disappointed, but I hope this can help us a little bit, at least to them because we have to believe and this is one step closer. -KGOMOTSO SETHUSHA|kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
