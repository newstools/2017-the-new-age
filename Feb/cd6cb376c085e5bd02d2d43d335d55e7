&nbsp;Cricket South Africa on Saturday announced plans for a Twenty20 league which it hopes will attract major international investment and big-name players.The #T20 Global League appears to be based on the successful Indian Premier League and Australia&#8217;s Big Bash League, although there were limited details about the structure of the tournament.Eight franchises will be sold and the teams are expected to be city-based, with the tournament being played in late 2017, when all South Africa&#8217;s leading players and many world stars are likely to be available.A tender has been issued with a deadline of March 3 for expressions of interest.&#8220;We are confident that the window we have chosen will make it possible for franchises to attract top-class players to South Africa,&#8221; said CSA chief executive Haroon Lorgat.Plans for the league were revealed to International Cricket Council member countries during ICC meetings in Dubai which ended on Friday.&#8220;Our vision is to drive the creation of a new T20 destination league in South Africa that would energise the sport of cricket in South Africa by creating a global platform for the best-in-class to perform and showcase their talent to a global audience,&#8221; said CSA president Chris Nenzani.&#8220;We have received a very favourable response to our plans from the ICC and member boards and look to their support.&#8221;-AFP
