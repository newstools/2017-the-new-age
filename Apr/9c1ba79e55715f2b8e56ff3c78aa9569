The North Gauteng High Court has ruled that the Prasa board dissolved by former Transport Minister Dipuo Peters must be reinstated.The court has on Monday also ruled that Peters&#8217; decision to dissolve the Prasa board be set aside and that appointment of the interim board also be set aside.Last month former Prasa board chairperson Popo Molefe brought an urgent application against Dipuo Peters to declare her dissolution of the board unlawful.This came after the acting CEO at Prasa Collins Letsoalo was fired for allegedly awarding himself a 350% salary hike.Molefe s court application was joined by other directors, who were also serving on the board, in an attempt to declare the Minister s decision unlawful.Letsoalo later applied to join in the matter as a respondent to the case but Judge Peter Mabuse dismissed his application.Last week Dipuo Peters resigned as an ANC Member of Parliament after President Jacob Zuma removed her from his cabinet during a reshuffle.-TNA Reporter
