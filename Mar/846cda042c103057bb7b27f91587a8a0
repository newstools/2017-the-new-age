Supersport United coach Stuart Baxter has returned to the frame for the Bafana Bafana job and appears to be the firm favourite for the position.Baxter has previously been linked with the national team, though he has continuously down played suggestions he will return to the job he occupied 11 years ago. Safa president Danny Jordaan, however, said an announcement on the new coach will be made after the friendly match against Angola, though he could not confirm the date.In fact, he revealed that the candidate has already been identified and it was now a matter of tying up the loose ends before an announcement could be made. There is an agreement on who the coach is now. It is just to sign the details, Jordaan said. We hope that it is soon after the Angola match that we wait no longer. It s been a process.We had to look at whether the coach has an existing contract and negotiate and also because of the time delay, it was not wise of us to bring in a new coach after the acting coach had selected the team. We could not disrupt the selection of the team and bring uncertainty into these two matches (against GuineaBissau and Angola). We have closed the process now and we will make the announcement. Safa have been battling to fill the void left by Shakes Mashaba in December, leaving assistant Owen da Gama to act in the position. Da Gama guided Bafana when they thumped GuineaBissau 3-1 in Durban on Saturday and will return to the dugout against Angola at Buffalo City Stadium tonight. But he may do so without key players Erick Mathoho, Thulani Hlatshwayo, Dean Furman and Andile Jali, who are injured.-KGOMOTSO SETHUSHA|kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
