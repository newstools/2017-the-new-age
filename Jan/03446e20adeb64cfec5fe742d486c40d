Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has encouraged learners of Phehellang Secondary School in Parys, Free State on Wednesday to believe in themselves as they are the pride of the country.&#8220;When you write and pass and get 100%, you are no longer doing it for yourself but for the whole nation,&#8221; said Ramaphosa.Ramaphosa and Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga visited the Free State school that obtained 100% matric pass rate in 2016.The visit was part of the Department&#8217;s School Readiness and back to school oversight and monitoring visits.He encouraged learners to achieve their goals by taking a few simple steps which are hard work, believing in themselves and asking for help.&#8220;You must believe in yourself even if you fail a subject,&#8221; said Ramaphosa.&#8220;When I looked around and looked at each one of you, I just saw clever people. As I looked at each face, you are all very clever, you are all intelligent, you are all very capable, you are all very outstanding,&#8221; said Ramaphosa to the learners.The school has managed to obtain 100% in the past two years.Ramaphosa said year after year they will be expecting nothing less than 100% pass rate for matric from the school.Meanwhile, Motshekga said learners shouldn&#8217;t make excuses about coming from disadvantaged families, as they are not the first.She said that learners can make it and be anything they want to be despite being from a township school. She said the Deputy President of the country, Ramaphosa, is one of the great examples of people who have made it, coming from a township school like them.The Free State province produced the highest number of pupils who passed their 2016 Grade 12 examinations. It achieved an 88.2% pass rate in 2016, an improvement of 6.6% compared with its 2015 results.&#8211;Keitumetsi Motlhale
