Baroka FC coach Kgoloko Thobejane believes that he is one of the best coaches in the Absa Premiership despite not having an accolade to back up his claims. Thobejane has guided Baroka to the top spot in the league table after playing 12 games. “I am the best coach based on the knowledge I have about football. The understanding of football, that’s why I call myself the best. I don’t’ have whatever accolades but I’m saying even if I have nothing I’m the best,” Thobejane said. Baroka FC has now gone five matches without a victory with seven draws and one defeat. They last won a league match against Kaizer Chiefs in September which ended in 2-1. However, Thobejane has indicated why his side is still at the top of the table after it survived relegation last season. “We never give up. We never felt intimidated when were we struggling last season. We took it as a situation the moment we found ourselves in it. “Now is our turn. What happened last season is over. This is our season. Let’s go all out to show this world that we can do it,” he said. Thobejane added that he does not need coaching qualifications to help the Limpopo based outfit to win the league. This comes after talks about him not having coaching qualifications in the Premier Soccer League made the rounds. “I don’t have those papers that people have (qualifications). I don’t want to go for those papers but I do understand football and I do not fear anyone. “Big or small, I will play football and I will teach football. I will talk football whether you like it or not. I’m mad or I’m dreaming, take it like that.” Baroka will be looking to extend their lead at the top of the table when they visit Mamelodi Sundowns on Tuesday at the Lucas Moripe Stadium. -TNA Reporter
