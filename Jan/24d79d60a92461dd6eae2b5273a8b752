Pop superstar Elton John unveiled Thursday his return to Broadway with a musical adaptation of the blockbuster film and novel &#8220;The Devil Wears Prada.&#8221;John will write the music for &#8220;The Devil Wears Prada,&#8221; with lyrics to be penned by Paul Rudnick, a humorist who frequently writes for The New Yorker magazine.&#8220;Reimagining &#8216;The Devil Wears Prada&#8217; for the musical theatre is super exciting,&#8221; John said in a statement, which added that the production timeline will be announced later.&#8220;I&#8217;m a huge fan of both the book and the feature film, and a huge aficionado of the fashion world. I can&#8217;t wait to sink my musical teeth into this hunk of popular culture,&#8221; the English musician said.While Broadway is notoriously tough terrain even for famous names, John has a proven record of triumph with musicals.&#8220;The Lion King,&#8221; his musical adaptation of the Disney animated film, set the record as the first show to gross $1 billion on Broadway where it remains the third longest-running show in history.He also found success with a musical adaptation of Verdi&#8217;s opera &#8220;Aida&#8221; as well as &#8220;Billy Elliot the Musical,&#8221; which closed last year after a successful run on London&#8217;s West End.Meryl Street and Anne Hathaway starred in the 2006 film &#8220;The Devil Wears Prada&#8221; about an all-powerful fashion magazine editor who tyrannically imposes her will on an ambitious young editorial assistant.A major international box-office success, &#8220;The Devil Wears Prada&#8221; was based on the popular novel of the same name by Lauren Weisberger. The author formerly worked for longtime Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, although she has never confirmed that Wintour was the inspiration.-AFP
