Stadiums built in Gabon for the Africa Cup of Nations are an &#8220;excellent legacy&#8221; for the country, the Confederation of African Football&#8217;s general secretary Hicham El Amrani told AFP on Saturday.Speaking ahead of Sunday&#8217;s final in Libreville between Egypt and Cameroon, El Amrani insisted the Cup of Nations had been a success despite poor attendances and bumpy pitches having a negative impact on the quality of football.&#8220;It has been positive. Obviously there are some negatives that we regret, in particular the quality of one of the pitches,&#8221; El Amrani said in reference to the surface in the port city of Port-Gentil, where a new stadium was opened for the tournament.Before Saturday&#8217;s third-place play-off between Ghana and Burkina Faso there, seven games there had yielded just nine goals and caused several injuries.&#8220;But even if the pitch at Port-Gentil was not fitting for this tournament, it will be in future. It is an excellent legacy for Gabon to have such stadiums,&#8221; declared El Amrani.&#8220;We are also satisfied with the level of football. There are really no little teams anymore.&#8220;Guinea-Bissau were participating for the first time and performed quite remarkably. And then there will be an historic final between Egypt and Cameroon.&#8221;He added: &#8220;In terms of the economic benefits, they are better than the last tournament according to estimations.&#8221;In reference to attendances, El Amrani refused to credit suggestions that crowds were hit by boycott calls from elements of the opposition to President Ali Bongo.&#8220;We would have liked to see bigger crowds at certain matches,&#8221; he said.&#8220;The presence of supporters is not linked to the price of tickets or as I have heard to the (political) opposition, because we don&#8217;t interfere in the internal affairs of Gabon.&#8220;It is however linked to transport problems. Certain stadiums like in Oyem and Franceville are difficult to access and when there is no public transport for 15-20,000 spectators, it is not easy.&#8221;El Amrani added that lessons had been learned ahead of the next Cup of Nations, which will be held in Cameroon in 2019.&#8220;We are working for the future to provide entertainment around the matches, as well as the fan zones we want to put in place in Cameroon.&#8220;We need to look after the pitches better ahead of the tournament.&#8220;We are already in contact with the local organising committee in Cameroon. Two years pass very quickly.&#8221;-AFP
