The highest court in our land is going to deliberate on this matter as they did in the past and they are going to make a ruling. Given the time frame that we have to the end of the month, I am absolutely certain the court is going to pull out all stops and deal with this matter with the level of urgency that it requires, he said.-TNA Reporter
