Americans celebrate Independence Day on Tuesday, and to mark the occasion President Donald Trump tweeted a partisan video clip of a church choir singing a song based on his campaign slogan.&#8220;Make America great again / Lift the torch of freedom all across the land / Step into the future joining hand in hand / And make America great again,&#8221; sings the choir of the First Baptist Church, a megachurch in Dallas, Texas.The 2:15 clip was taken from Saturday&#8217;s &#8220;Celebrate Freedom Rally&#8221; at the Kennedy Center in the US capital.&#8220;Your music honors our heroes more eloquently than words could ever do,&#8221; Trump said at the rally.The church is led by pro-Trump supporter Robert Jeffress, who was at the event.Christian conservatives living in &#8220;deep red&#8221; states like Texas are among Trump&#8217;s staunchest supporters.At least one self-described evangelical Christian took exception with the song.&#8220;Pledging allegiance to God and to America in the same breath, melding together the kingdom of God and self, they pray a blasphemous prayer to a red, white and blue Jesus,&#8221; said Jonathan Aigner, a Methodist director of music ministries.Writing in Patheos, a website discussing faith issues, Aigner dismissed Jeffress as a &#8220;presidential lapdog,&#8221; and decried &#8220;how tragically this prayer cancels out the prayer of Jesus himself.&#8221;
