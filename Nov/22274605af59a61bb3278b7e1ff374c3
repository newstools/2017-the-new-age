The Emfuleni municipality has a new mayor after roads and infrastructure committee chairperson in the Gauteng Legislature Jacob Khawe was sworn in this morning. Khawe takes over from disgraced former mayor Simon Mofokeng, who resigned last week following accusations of sexually grooming a 14-year-old girl. Khawe in his capacity as chairperson has been instrumental in attempting to bring an end to taxi-related violence in the province. Congratulations to the people of @EmfuleniLM for the beginning of the revitalization of their socio-economic development with the election of @jkhawe as their Executive Mayor. pic.twitter.com/Jby4UJ5WgY — SureBroSocks (@SureBroSocks) November 30, 2017 Last year, he was instrumental in the call that provincial officials who issue taxi permits and licenses be subjected to lifestyle audits. It was hoped the move would help bring an end to violence in the taxi industry. Administration in the local municipalities in Gauteng was thrown into disarray after Mofokeng inadvertently posted pictures of the 14-year-old girl in an ANC WhatsApp group. Mofokeng was then placed on special leave pending an investigation into the allegations. Last month. ANC Gauteng Provincial Office Bearers convened a meeting with ANC Sedibeng Regional Office Bearers in Johannesburg to consider allegations of sexual misconduct against Mofokeng. Gauteng cooperative governance and traditional affairs MEC Paul Mashatile accepted and welcomed Mofokeng’s resignation. -TNA Reporter
