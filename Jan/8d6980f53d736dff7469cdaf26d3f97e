American children&#8217;s television network Nickelodeon has announced it will build an underwater resort and theme park on an island known as the Philippines&#8217; last ecological frontier, alarming environmentalists.The firm behind SpongeBob SquarePants and Dora the Explorer said the park on Palawan island would be part of a 400-hectare (1,000-acre) undersea development showcasing the area&#8217;s marine life that would give fans a chance to &#8220;interact with the brand and the iconic characters they love&#8221;.Palawan was chosen for the development because it &#8220;is known to have some of the most beautiful beaches in the world today,&#8221; Ron Johnson, an executive vice president with Viacom International Media Networks, which owns Nickelodeon, said in a statement emailed to AFP on Tuesday.Viacom&#8217;s initial statement announcing the project on Monday said the resort would open in 2020 and feature restaurants and lounges six metres (20 feet) below sea level. The development would &#8220;advocate ocean protection&#8221; and conserve coral reefs, the statement said. But environmental group Greenpeace said it would destroy the area&#8217;s world-famous marine ecosystem.&#8220;It&#8217;s sad and alarming because a theme park that big will not promote environmental protection by building those structures,&#8221; Vince Cinches of Greenpeace Southeast Asia told AFP. &#8220;Why build a viewing deck when you have the whole paradise to enjoy?&#8221;Conservation groups call Palawan &#8220;the last frontier&#8221; because of its pristine coastlines and forests, which are among the oldest and most diverse in Southeast Asia. Palawan is home to two UNESCO World Heritage-listed sites, a subterranean river and the Tubbataha coral reefs.Palawan-based environmental activist Grizelda Mayo-Anda also expressed concern. &#8220;I am wary because we have had problems already with resorts built in mangrove areas,&#8221; Mayo-Anda, executive director of the Environmental Legal Assistance Center, told AFP. &#8220;I&#8217;m really concerned because sometimes, with all due respect to the local government unit, we get captivated by new projects and we do not judiciously study the impact.&#8221;Viacom&#8217;s Philippine partner, Coral World Park, insisted the resort would not hurt the environment. &#8220;We are taking very, very careful measures to ensure that the biodiversity is kept intact,&#8221; Coral World Park chairman Paul Monozca told AFP. Coral World Park said the development would be part of a coral reef conservation programme including a marine sanctuary for species like dolphins and sea cows.The Palawan Council for Sustainable Development, a government body, said the project had yet to be approved.-AFP
