SAA has experienced extensive delays and flight cancellations due to a strike by cabin crew members on Wednesday.The crew who are demanding an increase in their meal allowances which the union, SA Cabin Crew Association (SACCA), said had not increased for over five years. On Wednesday morning 32 flights were cancelled which included 28 domestic, three regional and one international flight, SAA said in a statement.SACCA stated that the strike could have been avoided, however, the employer did not meet their demands.&#8220;Our demands are very clear with management, we told them even yesterday at night, we left SAA very late at night trying to avert the strike because we have to come to an agreement somehow but we couldn&#8217;t because there was nothing on the table for the cabin crew,&#8221; Christopher Shabangu, SACCA deputy president said.&#8220;We have given them a chance over the past five years to deal with this and they have refused to deal with this, now it has come to a head where the cabin crew can&#8217;t deal with this any more,&#8221; Shabangu said.He added that the crew members had entered into a non-violent strike to show their frustrations to the employer and the South African public.SACCA vows not to offer services until their demands have been met.&#8221;It&#8217;s not about violence, it&#8217;s about them hearing us, by not offering our services today and going forward if this is not resolved,&#8221; said Shabangu.The SACCA said their members stay in foreign countries for a long period and the allowance that SAA offers them at the moment is not enough to sustain them.The union is demanding that cabin crew members be offered about R2 200 a day meal allowance when travelling overseas. They are at the moment being given about R1 711, a figure which SACCA says it has not been increased in more than 5 years.The strike by crew members could see services like refreshments and luggage loading not being offered in planes.SAA says it is doing its best to resolve strike during ongoing negotiations with the union.&#8220;The airline will ensure that all changes are published timeously and day of travel support will be provided to customers who may experience flight delays or cancellations that may occur during this period,&#8221; said SAA in a statement.The airline encouraged customers to visit its website www.flysaa.com for regular updates on all flight schedules.-TNA Reporter
