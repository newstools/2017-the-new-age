Provincial education MEC Mandla Makupula has called on schools and communities to work hard to ensuring that proper teaching and learning took place and was not compromised in any way.Announcing the provincial matric results in East London yesterday, he revealed that the province recorded a 1.3% improvement in bachelors passes. The number of bachelors passes increased from 15291 in 2015 to 15654 in 2016.The province is the worst performer in the national senior certificate results with a 59.3% pass rate. It recorded a 2.5% increase from 2015 s 56.8%. The country s pass rate stood at 72.5% including progressed pupils. We call on our communities to continue playing a meaningful role in ensuring that schools remain focused on learning and teaching at all times. In that way, we can start to instil a morality that recognises and respects the role of education as a catalyst for transformation, he said.The province is the only one with some districts that obtained less than a 50% pass rate.The MEC attributed a three-year transformation plan adopted last year as a major contributing factor for the slight improvement. This improvement represents an advance to the 8.6% decline experienced in 2015, a significant departure from the average historical learner performance profile of the Eastern Cape.The executive council subsequently instructed the department to develop a sustainable system-wide recovery plan and, undoubtedly, the three-year transformation plan adopted by the executive council in January 2016 provides a significant base to account for the improvements, he said.He said that the three-year plan was aimed at giving more attention to poorly resourced schools. It focuses on transforming the overall education system while at school level placing a specific focus on 560 viable quintile 1 to 3 secondary schools.The catch them at the end strategic thrust of the plan sought to maximise opportunities of learners achieving a good pass in the national senior certificate while improving performance in the whole system, he said.Makupula said his department had set up a matric countdown programme targeting 58000 pupils in quintiles 1-3 schools.He said that the programme focused on progressed, high risk pupils, and also on schools presenting matric classes for the first time. The 123 support centres across the 23 districts to support progressed and high risk learners have been established. About 30000 learners benefit from the project in key gateway subjects.Winter and spring schools programme study camps focusing on 800 learners in mathematics, physical sciences and accounting, he said.It was also revealed that at least 50000 pupils from poor schools had benefited from weekend and extra classes conducted.Reacting to the results, the provincial DA s Edmund van Vuuren said that the key changes should be made in a bid to improve the province s matric performance. We are the worst performing province, with the five worst performing districts each obtaining less than 50%, he said.Van Vuuren accused the department of failing pupils by not reducing the number of districts.Non-governmental organisation Equal Education has said that the matric results should not be used as a sole indicator of the education system , pointing out that rural provinces such as the Eastern Cape, Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal were faced with a myriad of problems.The organisation said that budgets should be allocated and channelled to the foundation phase level instead of over investing on matric as this phase was often neglected.TNA reporter
