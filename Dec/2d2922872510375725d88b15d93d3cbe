The Limpopo Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant Nneke Ledwaba has commended the dedicated Provincial Tracking Team for arresting a suspect for kidnapping, armed robbery, extortion and impersonating a traffic police officer. This comes after receiving information from operatives the Provincial Tracking Team, Crime Intelligence and Provincial detectives intercepted a kidnapping syndicate in progress in the Thohoyandou Policing area. Ledwaba indicated that on Thursday, the suspects demanded a ransom from family members of the kidnapped victim before releasing him. “The family was told to drop the money at a particular joint in Polokwane,” said Ledwaba. The team monitored the drop-off location for a few hours when the transaction was made. “Police approached the suspects and ordered them to surrender when they sped off and a vehicle chase ensued. About 43km outside Polokwane along R81 road, the suspects’ car lost control. One of the suspects escaped and another was arrested,” Ledwaba said. The suspect will appear before the Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court when he is officially charged, while his accomplice is still being traced. Police investigations are still continuing. -TNA Reporter
