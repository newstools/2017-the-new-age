THE Mbombela municipality has set up an association of non-profit organisations to assist local NPOs to run and manage their structures.Chairperson of the city of Mbombela NPO association, Simon Mdluli, says they want to help local NPOs with administrative requirements required for auditing purposes. We want to combine all the NPOs through the municipality to meet the needs of the communities, like helping them to compile a narrative report on their operations, Mdluli said.He said the main aim of the association was to minimise duplication of funding processes. He said, in some cases, a cr che would be funded twice, leaving other organisations destitute. When we are working with direction, it will be easier for us to know how many NPOs are available for home-based care and how many NPOs are dealing with kids and how many organisations are dealing with youth. The association does not provide funding.Instead it refers organisations to companies that are looking to provide funding. Right now there is an organisation that is getting funds from the US for HIV-Aids, he said.At the national NPO summit in August 2012, the department of social development said the delivery of social services was a collective responsibility of various role players, including government, NPOs and the private sector which is something the Mbombela association is trying to link together.Tshikululu Social Investments, an organisation that provides fund management and advisory services, reported that things funders insist on are good governance, good financial management, leadership and succession planning, accountability, monitoring and evaluation as well as sustainability.These are skills the new NPO organisation is trying to instil in the management of local NPOs.HLONI MASHIGO
