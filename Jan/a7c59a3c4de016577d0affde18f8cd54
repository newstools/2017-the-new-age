THREE men accused of the brutal rape and murder of a 17-year-old schoolgirl were acquitted of murder in the Wynberg Magistrate s Court yesterday. Only one will face justice for strangling Franziska Bl chliger and suffocating her in Tokai forest on March 7.The remaining three accused namely Jerome Moses, Jonathan Jonas and Daniel Easter s case was transferred to another courtroom where they only face charges of theft. Their case was postponed to February 17.The teenager s body was found after she had left home to go for a jog. The case was yesterday transferred to the Western Cape High Court where the remaining accused will go on trial for the murder, rape and robbery of the teen.The case, which initially saw four accused in the dock for the teens case was scheduled for the outcome of a bail application for accused Howard Oliver.During the bail applica-tion proceedings, Oliver told the court that he only robbed the teen of her cell-phone because he needed money to pay for his child s school fees.He said accused number three Jona-than Jonas raped and killed the teen.The court denied him bail and said the applicant admitted to committing the crime of robbing her because of his financial burden and as the situation remained the same because he was unemployed which could see him commit another schedule one crime.The court also said the DNA of Oliver was found under the finger nails of the teen.Magistrate Goolam Bowa said: In totality of the evidence, the court is of the view that the applicant did not show exceptional circumstances. Bail is accordingly denied. Court proceedings also saw the state bring a Sec-tion 157 for the accused to be separated which was granted and saw Howard having to stand alone for the murder, rape and robbery of the teenager. Your case has been postponed to February 3 and transferred to the Western Cape High Court for a retrial hearing, Bowa said.Bl chliger was found naked and on her knees, with her neck twisted into an unnatural position. Police said a bra and a T-shirt were used to strangle her.-Nadine Ford-Kritzinger
