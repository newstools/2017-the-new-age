City of Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba says investigations will have to be undertaken to probe the qualifications of builders who constructed some of the buildings that collapsed during a storm yesterday. Mashaba said he was not happy with the quality of the work done on properties that were damaged. He was speaking during a walkabout in Lenasia which was hardest hit by the storms. Mashaba said the city would get involved in relief efforts but could not do it alone. He said they were calling on private companies and organisations to help with relief efforts. The executive said a meeting would be held later today to find out how the nationalÂ government can also help in relief efforts. Mashaba said he has also called on Emergency Services to investigate the individual needs of the families affected. -TNA Reporter
