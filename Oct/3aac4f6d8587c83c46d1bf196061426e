The North Gauteng High Court has on Monday provided huge relief to the 7000 Oakbay employees after ordering the Bank of Baroda to keep the accounts of the company open. Handing down his ruling Judge Tati Makgoka ruled that the bank may not deactivate or close the accounts of Oakbay. Makgoka also interdicted Bank of Baroda from ” In any way limiting the manner in which the banking accounts are operated by the applicants,”. The Judge directed Oakbay to within 15 days launch an application against the Bank for the final relief it deems appropriate. Last month 20 companies falling under the Oakbay umbrella had previously lost their bid to prevent the Indian based bank from closing the company’s remaining bank accounts, after seeking an interdict to delay the closure until their main application was to be heard on December 7. The Bank, which is the only remaining financial service provider for the Gupta owned companies has argued that it faces a “reputational risk” should it continue to do business with Oakbay Oakbay has consistently argued that the fate of 7 500 workers hung in the balance as the companies could not operate without a bank.  -Siphiwe Mchunu
