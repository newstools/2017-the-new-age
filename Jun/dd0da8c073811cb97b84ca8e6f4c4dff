The Empangeni Regional Court has on Monday handed down a life imprisonment to a 45-year-old man for raping his child.The court heard how on June 24, last year, an 11-year-old child complained of stomach cramp. She complained to her father about her condition. The father took her to a local clinic where it was established that the little girl was pregnant.The court heard that the child told the nurse that she had been raped by her father since 2013 when she was eight years, and that assault had taken place when her mother was away.The court heard that the child gave birth to the baby who has since died.The incident was reported to the police in Empangeni and transferred to Empangeni Family Violence and Child Protection and Sexual Offences units for further investigation.Commenting on the judgment, KwaZulu-Natal acting provincial commissioner Major-General Bheki Langa said: We will continue to send all sexual offenders in prison where they belong. Crimes against women and children will always be treated as a priority since the victims are most vulnerable to ruthless criminals whom they trust.&#8221;-TNA Reporter
