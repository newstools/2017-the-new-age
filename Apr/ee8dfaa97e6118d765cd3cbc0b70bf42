More than 2 million students in the country s tertiary various institutions have benefited from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) over the last four years, Higher Education and Training Minister Dr Blade Nzimande said.He reiterated the government s commitment to assist poor and middle class students, who were unable to pay for their studies. It is important to note that these figures will increase after the conclusion of all pending funding decisions. In this regard, NSFAS has employed additional resources to expedite the process, he said.He also said college funding decisions for the current academic year will be concluded at the end of this month with 123332 students already receiving support .Nzimande said 194353 university students are being supported the latest academic year, with 78413 covering first time entrances and 115940 for returning students .The challenge of funding students especially from poor families still remains a big issue in South Africa. As a result, thousands have taken to the streets under the banner #FeesMustFall demanding support from the government.Figures released by the department show that there s been an increase in the number of students funded through NSFAS.While 194923 university students received funding from NSFAS in 2013, the figure rose to 244488 in 2016.Students, who benefited in TVET colleges in 2016 were numbered at 225864.But the funding system has not been without challenges.Last month some students at certain universities threatened to protest actions as a result of experiencing delays in the payment of allowances by the NSFAS.Students from University of Venda and the Mangosuthu University of Technology took to the streets demanding immediate payment.It was estimated that the number of students affected stood at 200000. Some students leaders described the problem as a crisis .But NSFAS denied that it was to be blamed for the problem. 701233-TNA Reporter
