Zimbabwe police arrested prominent protest pastor and anti-government campaigner Evan Mawarire on Monday after he spoke to a group of striking medical students, his family and lawyer said.Mawarire, who last year led a mass anti-government movement dubbed &#8220;#ThisFlag&#8221; after he appeared on social media draped in the national colours, was arrested at the University of Zimbabwe, his sister Teldah Mawarire told AFP.&#8220;I am with him at the police station,&#8221; said his lawyer Harrison Nkomo, adding that Mawarire had been charged with &#8220;disorderly conduct in a public place&#8221;.Mawarire had earlier posted a video clip of his arrest on social media saying it was linked to his speech to students.&#8220;I have been arrested. I am at Avondale police station,&#8221; Mawarire said in the 42-second video clip.&#8220;The reason I have been arrested is that I addressed university students whose fees had been increased. I have done nothing wrong.&#8221;Scores of placard-wielding students assembled at the main student union building to protest fee increases.&#8220;The students are holding a peaceful protest against the decision to increase their fees two weeks before they sit for their examinations,&#8221; Allister Pfunde, president of the Zimbabwe National Students&#8217; Union told AFP.&#8220;The majority of these students can&#8217;t afford decent accommodation and proper meals.&#8221;The university accused the students of throwing stones and responded by ordering all medical students out of their university halls of residence.Mawarire&#8217;s anti-government movement shut down major cities and paralysed public transport and prompted the government to ban public protests.He was arrested and and charged with &#8220;attempting to subvert a constitutionally-elected government&#8221; though he has yet to face trial over those charges.-AFP
