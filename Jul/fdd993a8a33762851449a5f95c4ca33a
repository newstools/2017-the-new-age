Eight-time world boxing champion Manny Pacquiao has said he will &#8220;think hard&#8221; about retiring after his stunning and controversial defeat to unheralded Australian challenger Jeff Horn.Arriving home in the Philippines a day after losing his World Boxing Organization welterweight title in a major upset in Brisbane on Sunday, the 38-year-old Pacquiao said he was thinking about hanging up his gloves for good.&#8220;I am also considering the opinion of people, the opinion of my family and my body,&#8221; Pacquiao told ABS-CBN television on Monday night when asked about retirement.&#8220;I plan to relax first and recover from the pains in my body and then after that, when I have already relaxed, that&#8217;s when I will think hard about it.&#8221;Immediately after the fight, Pacquiao had said he wanted a rematch with Horn.Pacquiao&#8217;s wife, Jinkee, and his trainer, Freddie Roach, had said they would advise him to quit boxing after a phenomenal 22-year professional career in which he won world titles in an unprecedented eight weight divisions.Pacquiao briefly retired from boxing last year to pursue his long-held political ambitions and was elected senator. But he quickly made a successful comeback against Jessie Vargas in November, saying he still felt like a youngster.The 29-year-old Horn&#8217;s ultra-aggressive style proved too much for Pacquiao, with the three judges scoring the fight 117-111, 115-113 and 115-113 to the Australian after 12 rounds.On Monday, Pacquiao made disparaging comments about his opponent.&#8221;He&#8217;s not really good but he&#8217;s really strong,&#8221; Pacquiao said of Horn, as he questioned the decisions of American referee Mark Nelson.&#8220;There is no problem with the style of Jeff Horn if he plays dirty, because there is a referee,&#8221; Pacquiao said.&#8220;The problem here is that the referee, I don&#8217;t know if he did it deliberately or he just did not have experience, he just allowed it and did not even give any warning for how many times. It&#8217;s as if the referee wanted to help my opponent.&#8221;-AFP
