Coming back home to plough back the knowledge that I have gathered whilst I was out there. It feels great to be given an opportunity by Bra Mike [Mike Mokoena] and his management to lead the team and I am up for the challenge,&#8221; Letsoaka said on the clubs website.The 53 year old said he was the last captain at Free State Stars to fit major silverware for the team, he said he&#8217;d like to lift a trophy as a coach now. Most importantly is to get the team away from the relegation zone and to get stability in the team and we build the team and make sure that we are the force we are use to be. said the former Captain.TNA Reporter
