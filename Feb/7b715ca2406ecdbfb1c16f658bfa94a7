The wife of 92-year-old Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said Friday that he would be the voters&#8217; choice even after he dies, as she addressed supporters from the ruling ZANU-PF party.Grace Mugabe, who is seen as a possible successor to her ailing husband, ratcheted up her colourful rhetoric ahead of the general election due next year.&#8220;One day when God decides that Mugabe dies, we will have his corpse appear as a candidate on the ballot paper,&#8221; Grace Mugabe told a party rally in Buhera, southeast of the capital Harare.&#8220;You will see people voting for Mugabe as a corpse. I am seriously telling you &#8212; just to show people how people love their president.&#8221;President Mugabe has vowed to stand again in the election, but Grace could run if he dies before the vote.Grace Mugabe, who was appointed leader of ZANU-PF&#8217;s women&#8217;s wing in a surprise move two years ago, is well known for her fiery speeches and verbal attacks on her husband&#8217;s opponents.In 2015, she led a campaign which led to the ousting of deputy president Joice Mujuru, accusing Mujuru of fanning factionalism, plotting to topple Mugabe and corruption and bribery.President Mugabe, the world&#8217;s oldest national leader, turns 93 on Tuesday, with a celebration party planned for next Saturday.Grace has previously pledged to push Mugabe in his wheelchair to election rallies if needed.Mugabe, who has been in power since Zimbabwe&#8217;s independence in 1980, has avoided naming a successor and his party is divided between factions jostling to succeed him.Grace bemoaned the in-fighting, telling those seeking to succeed her husband: &#8220;Let&#8217;s not fool each other, let&#8217;s wait for God&#8217;s time.&#8221;-AFP
