THE province is slowly making progress in its battle against tuberculosis (TB) but it is not enough to reach the End TB Strategy and sustainable development goals target for 2030.A recent report by the Health Systems Trust showed the province needs to make concerted efforts to reduce its TB death and cure rates.In 2014, the province had the highest proportion of deaths due to TB, despite recording a slight decrease of 0.7% from the previous year. The chronic disease attributed for 11.2% of deaths, while it reported a TB incidence rate of 813.7 per 100 000 population.At a district level, uThungulu district had the biggest increase in TB deaths compared to 2013 from 3.1% to 4.9% while uMkhanyakude district saw the largest decline in death rate from 6.9% to 2.8%. Factors that increase the risk of death for TB patients in South Africa are advanced stage, HIV co-infection, a prior history of TB, and the presence of both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB, the report said.Contrary to previous years when the cure rate increased steadily, the province reported a decline from 82.8% in 2013 to 78.7% in 2014.The eThekwini district reported a decline in the cure rate of more than 7%. The report said the reason for the drop in the province s cure rate was the proportion of patients not evaluated, namely more than 12% of patients in five districts in 2014.Among all the districts, eThekwini struggled with the highest proportion of cases not evaluated (18.5%). In yet another blow, the province recorded a significant decline in treatment success from 81.8% in 2013 to 73.8% in 2014.Again, the eThekwini district had the lowest treatment success rates (67.9%). The large number of not-evaluated cases in 2014 was partly blamed for the decline.The province made major strides in the proportion of new TB cases reported in the province. The provincial hospitals recorded a notable decline in the TB incidence rate from 1185 to 685 per 100000 population over the past five years.HIV remained a key driver of the TB epidemic, as disconnected and inadequate services contributed to poor treatment outcomes in patients co-infected with TB and HIV.The province has one of the highest co-infection rates at 63.6%, but performed well in the categories of TB patients across the province who knew their HIV status and proportion of co-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy in 2015.Although TB incidence and deaths had been declining since 2009, the epidemic remained the number one cause of death in the country.The global TB report in 2015 estimated that in 2014 South Africa had the second-highest TB incidence rate in the world, with 834 cases per 100 000 population.LESLEY TSHAMANO
