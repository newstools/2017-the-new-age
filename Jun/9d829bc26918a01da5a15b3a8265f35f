THE ANC must elect leaders that will capture the hearts and minds of not only the party s faithful but also the electorate at large, Gauteng ANC chairperson Paul Mashatile said.Speaking at the close of the ANC s provincial policy conference in Pretoria yesterday, Mashatile said the ruling party had to elect leaders to enhance the ANC s prospects of retaining power in the 2019 general elections.He said the ANC in the province would lobby other provinces and regions to negotiate a consensus about the top six ANC national executive committee (NEC) leadership but doing away with leaders who can t lead was nonnegotiable. We ll continue to discuss the kind of leadership that will lead our organisation into the future. We ll do everything in our power to persuade each other. We want to ensure the ANC is lead by the best among us who will inspire the confidence of South Africans beyond members of the ANC.Our NEC can t be a reflection of one province, Mashatile said. Mashatile said it was important for the ANC not to marginalise its alliance partners from participating in the ruling party s hotly contested succession debate. We must not leave out our alliance partners. It s important to engage with Sanco, Cosatu and the SACP, he said. Mashatile also said the provincial ANC rubbished the notion of white monopoly capital. There is nothing called white monopoly capital in our vocabulary. It smacks of populism that will bring confusion within our ranks, he said.BONOLO SELEBANO bonolos@thenewage.co.za
