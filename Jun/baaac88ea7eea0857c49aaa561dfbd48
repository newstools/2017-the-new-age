Absa is to approach the high court to challenge the public protector&#8217;s report findings on its liability to repay the more than R1bn bailout grant it received in the 1990s, the organisation said in a statement.Public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane this week released a report making recommendations that the state should take legal action to recover the R1.125bn that was given to Bankorp, Absa&#8217;s predecessor.Absa released a statement on Wednesday expressing its intentions to approach the high court to have Mkhwebane&#8217;s findings taken on review.&#8220;After consultation with its legal team, Absa has decided to approach the high court to have the report of the public protector released on Monday reviewed and set aside, Absa said in a statement.Absa has argued that the report contained numerous misrepresentations and factual inaccuracies used as the basis for its findings, and that the findings were irrational with unreasonable legal conclusions.&#8220;The report leaves Absa with no choice but to seek recourse in the courts as provided for by the Constitution when an affected party disagrees with the findings of the public protector, the bank said in a statement.The financial institution argued that the public protector appeared to have either ignored or misunderstood Absa&#8217;s detailed submissions, which Absa made on two occasions.&#8220;A copy of our February 2017 submission has been released to the public. We also note that the Public Protector&#8217;s remedial actions include a directive to Parliament to amend the Constitution in order to change the mandate of the South African Reserve Bank.&#8220;We are advised that the Public Protector Act does not empower the public protector to direct that constitutional amendments be made. Her recommended amendments pose a very serious risk to the financial system and cannot be allowed to stand.&#8220;It is noteworthy that the report&#8217;s findings and remedial actions in relation to Absa are mainly premised on the conclusions of the Davis Panel of Experts, which delivered a comprehensive report on the same matter in February 2002. The public protector also uses the statement of the Heath Special Investigating Unit as a further basis for her conclusions on Absa,&#8221; the statement said.-TNA Reporter &nbsp;&nbsp;
