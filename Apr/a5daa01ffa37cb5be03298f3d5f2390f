UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres sought to reassure international Jewish community leaders on Sunday that he would stand up against any perceptions of anti-Israel bias at the world organization.Guterres spoke amid a deepening row over alleged bias within the UN following US pressure, exacerbated last month when a UN rights expert issued a blistering criticism of Israel&#8217;s policies.Guterres said he would &#8220;guarantee&#8221; that those working under him would abide by principles that he considers right.&#8220;As secretary general of the United Nations I consider that the state of Israel needs to be treated as any other state,&#8221; he said to applause at the World Jewish Congress in New York.&#8220;I have already had the opportunity to show that I&#8217;m ready to abide by that principle even when that forces me to take some decisions that create some uncomfortable situations,&#8221; he added.Former UN official and Jordanian national Rima Khalaf last month said Guterres asked her to withdraw a report in which she accused Israel of being an &#8220;apartheid state&#8221; and subsequently resigned.The UN chief nonetheless qualified: &#8220;That does not mean that I will always be in agreement with all the decisions that are taken at any moment by any government that exists in Israel.&#8221;Guterres promised that he would be &#8220;in the frontline&#8221; in the struggle against anti-Semitism, which he warned was on the rise in Europe and America, and called &#8220;absolutely unacceptable.&#8221;He promised to &#8220;make sure that the United Nations is able to conduct all possible actions for anti-Semitism to be condemned, and if possible eradicated from the face of the earth.&#8221;His 15-minute speech was interrupted by applause at least 11 times. The former Portuguese prime minister was also given a standing ovation.It was the first time that a UN secretary general has addressed an international gathering of Jewish leaders.Israel last month announced a $2 million cut in its contribution to the UN budget because of constant criticism by the UN Human Rights Council of its policies towards the Palestinians.Israel had already cut $6 million from its $11.7 million contribution after a Security Council resolution passed in December condemned Israel&#8217;s settlement building in the occupied West Bank.On Monday, UN Security Council ambassadors are scheduled to meet US President Donald Trump and US lawmakers for talks likely to include the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and US cuts to UN funding.-AFP
