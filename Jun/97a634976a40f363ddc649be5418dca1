A man initially approached to carry out the alleged hit on Jayde Panayiotou had been phoned 17 times by Christopher Panayiotou&#8217;s girlfriend, Chanelle Coutts, the Port Elizabeth High Court heard yesterday.Panayiotou s mistress, Coutts, is said to have communicated with Trompie 17 times between September and October 2014 Botha revealed.Testifying at the high court yesterday, a data analyst Thereza Botha told the court that Panayiotou s cousin cellphone had been used to contact suspected hitman Sizwezakhe Vumazonke before Jayde s murder.According to media reports, Botha &#8220;tied up&#8221; months of evidence and set out to &#8220;connect the dots&#8221; between Panayiotou and his co-accused.Botha told state advocate Marius Stander that:&#8221;In this matter, the data analysis is not only looking at the events that took place on April 21 2015, but casts a broader view of what preceded that day.&#8221;Even though Panayiotou made regular contacts with the alleged coordinator, Luthando Siyoni, to arrange his wife s murder, she shocked the court when she revealed that Siyoni made regular contacts with various acquaintances saved on his phone as Trompie , Happy Trigger or Sky before ultimately giving the job to the now-deceased Vumazonke.On February 2015, Siyoni sent a text message to &#8220;Sky&#8221; with a description of Jayde s car. Media reports stated that Vumazonke was alleged to have recruited Sinethemba Nemembe to help him carry out the kidnapping and the eventual murder of Jade on April 21, 2015.&nbsp;Botha said Panayiotou and Coutts were in regular contact, except when Panayiotou was with Jayde on her family s farm near Uitenhage.Judge Dayalin Chetty on Monday accepted the cellphone records as evidence against two of the accused.Panayiotou, his co-accused Zolani Sibeko and Sinethemba Nenembe, are charged with conspiring to kidnap and murder of the school teacher Jayde Panayiotou.The trial continues today.
