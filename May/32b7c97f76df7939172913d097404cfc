South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) chief executive Thokozani Magwaza said he took an advice from Treasury on whether the work streams are above board.Magwaza says he plans on acting on the advice provided by Treasury.The work streams were appointed by Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini two years ago to come up with a plan for the agency to take over the payment of grants.Through court papers submitted to Constitutional Court the Sassa chief revealed that the work streams reported directly to the minister, adding that the agency was not allowed to interfere in the work. I&#8217;m busy finalising a submission to the minister, advising on the next move I&#8217;m going to be taking on the issue of work streams, Magwaza said.It is reported that the work streams had cost Sassa more than R40 million.The Constitutional Court is expected to hand down judgement on Tuesday.-Sipho Jack
