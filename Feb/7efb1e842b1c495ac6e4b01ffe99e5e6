Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma may prove to be South Africa s hope, as the shining star of the African continent continues to surpass all obstacles along the road of unrivalled success not only as the former chairperson of the African Union but in having decades of political experience.Having held three ministerial cabinet positions, she proves a force to be reckoned with, as her experience is unrivalled. It almost seems her becoming a candidate for the presidency is inevitable as in 2009 she was suggested as a possible candidate for presidency.Although she had four children with Jacob Zuma, she has held a predominantly democratic position in politics. In the 2007 elections, she was marginally aligned to former president Thabo Mbeki and was one of the 10 ministers that resigned when he was ousted.However, she kept her position in the cabinet under Motlanthe s tenure. The race to become the chairperson of the AU was a challenging one, and yet she succeeded against the powerful male African politicians who were contesting her. Despite the opportunity, Dlamini Zuma declined a second four-year term at the AU, showing that she has set her sights on another powerful role. There were many significant accomplishments that she pioneered, perhaps one of the most important ones was the Tobacco Products Control Bill which prohibits citizens from smoking in public spaces.Not only did she take on the arduous job of fixing Home Affairs, which she inherited in a dismal state, she also introduced free healthcare for women and children as well as the impoverished and it was directly related to the reduction of the mortality rate in the country.Not only did she pioneer solutions to serious societal issues, she also has been a strong advocate and voice against global problems such as human trafficking, corruption, women s rights and more. Her vision for Africa is absolute and unwavering and it was only recently that she called for exports to reduce as Africa needs to become a self-sustainable economy.Dlamini Zuma has always been outspoken, fearless and ambitious. Also a champion of the people, she did not hesitate to speak out against South Sudan due to the 2 million inhabitants displaced, she also did not hesitate to harshly criticise the presidencies of other African countries such as those in the DRC, Gambia and Burundi.Dlamini Zuma has always been aware of the international laws and obligations that proceed with her leadership roles as well as maintaining an active stance of nonviolence. Therefore the ANC Women s League is right to back her as their preferred candidate for the presidency, as she epitomises what the ANCWYL stands for, a movement that advocates the leadership and empowerment of women.Dlamini Zuma has proven herself worthy of such an endorsement.While Cyril Ramaphosa s reputation as a business leader has been marred with his dictatorship style of governance and tainted with the tragedy of Marikana, his business experience might not be a match for Dlamini Zuma s decades of political experience.The ANCWYL should not be condemned for backing Dlamini Zuma, as Ramaphosa has been positioning himself for the position of the presidency for years, through taking part in the factional politics of the Tripartite Alliance, which is why it comes as no surprise that Cosatu will be backing him as its preferred candidate. Although detractors will attempt to paint Dlamini Zuma with the president s brush, it would not be fair to crucify her for the socalled sins of her ex-husband. It was Dlamini Zuma s decision to divorce from Zuma in 1998.After that, she was widely considered to be a part of the Mbeki faction. Therefore it would be incorrect for anyone to say that she is biased towards him. Above all, having a track record in navigating through politics was a result of her hard work and effort, something that the men in leadership around her cannot take credit for, nor have they ever sought to, as she stands as a woman of power in her own right.Some might go as far as arguing that her marital history with Zuma has at times been more of a hindrance in her leadership ambitions, as she has proven her ability to hold office and has taken her position in the AU with utmost seriousness and gravitas.Dlamini Zuma is, without a doubt a high calibre politician, who has not only been a commendable leader of Africa but regarded with great respect internationally and may be the ideal candidate to stand as the president.Chelsea LotzChelsea Lotz is a writer and commentator
