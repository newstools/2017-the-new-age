Mamelodi Sundowns have recorded their second successive league win following their 1-0 win over struggling Free State Stars on Sunday at the James Motlatsi Stadium.The Brazilians struggled to get into their rhythm, as their attacking trio, Percy Tau, Khama Billiat and Themba Zwane failed break Stars defence. Billiat was unlucky to get a goal in the 25th minute when his effort was brilliantly saved by Thela Ngobeni.The visitors eventually got their lead in the last kick of the first-half through defender Motjeka Madisha. In the second half Sundowns showed their attacking intent clear when coach Pitso Mosimane brought on Anthony Laffor to replace Mashaba.However, the home side continued to look for an equaliser as they threw numbers forward. Sundowns had couple of chances in the closing stages of the game but could not convert the chance.
