When Trevor Manuel was dazzling the financial world with his fiscal acumen, the opposition DA used to take a dig at him by saying he would never be president of South Africa.The DA s contention was that Manuel was the wrong colour, that s why he would not make the cut as president.Manuel, of course, as the DA pointed out, was not African, as defined by the ANC. He was coloured, whether he was happy with that racial definition or not.So his colour was inconvenient and therefor ruled him out of the race if he had harboured any presidential ambitions.But the DA s words have come back to haunt the party in the Western Cape, that part of South Africa where people who are still being called coloured despite there not being a law that racially classifies South Africans form the majority.While claiming to be more non-racial than the ANC, the DA has not been dead to the possibilities that an African leader such as Mmusi Maimane could lead the party and its electoral fortunes.He speaks well, appeals to those who vote DA and because he would have been classified as African in the apartheid South Africa he can also draw those whom the ANC refers to as the African people in particular to vote for the DA.All these credentials appealed to former DA national leader Helen Zille who anointed Maimane as the person to succeed her. Some would call this practical politics.I would call it political opportunism.But I do accept it will take a long time before South African leaders will be judged in the eyes of the public on their ability rather than on their pigmentation.If the DA solution to target the majority of voters is so practical, then Zille, because she belongs to a minority group, should not be Premier of the Western Cape.Using her own rationale, she should step down in favour of a person from the majority group.And if the formula of someone from the majority group only being able to break through resistance and lure members of this group to vote for the DA is right, then Boginkosi Madikizela shouldn t not be moaning about his not being coloured enough to replace Patricia de Lille as Western Cape DA leader.If so-called coloureds do not want him as an interim leader until a new one is chosen in December they are only following Zille s lead. Madikizela s protestations at the weekend will not bolster his ambitions to fill De Lille s shoes temporarily.On the contrary using the race card, albeit in reverse, will count against him. It s a pity that he , like those not African in the eyes of the ANC, will not be judged on his abilities, but on the colour of his skin.
