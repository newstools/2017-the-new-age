The Huawei Watch 2 is a watch that s about far more than just its looks. As we work towards our summer bodies, this sporty Huawei Watch 2 should be your next smart watch of choice.What is impressive about this watch is that it has no Apple Watch-inspired twist navigation options. Instead, the top control acts as the main app button and the bottom button leads you straight into the watch s fitness menus or any other app. The main selling point about this watch is its battery life. The watch has a special watch mode that can display the time and track steps for up to 25 days on a single charge.To top that, it has a 4G LTE cellular connection making it an all-inclusive Android Wear 2.0 watch. Other great features to look forward to include a 1.1GHz Snapdragon Wear 2 100 chip set with 768MB of RAM and 4GB of storage. Perhaps the only disappointment is the display on the watch. At 3.17cm it s small and feels even smaller when you try to use the on-screen keyboard.The display is just bright enough to read everything and generally responsive to the touch, but this is not the watch s standout feature.-INDIE BOYCE|indiphileb@thenewage.co.za
