His first days in office indicate that President Donald Trump intends to implement what he promised, with serious consequences for the future of the UN, trade, the environment and international cooperation and developing countries will be most affected.Those who hoped Trump would be more statesman like and middle of the road in policy matters after his inauguration had their illusions dashed when Trump moved straight into action to fulfil his election pledges.Mexicans are understandably outraged and the Mexican president cancelled his planned trip to Washington. Mexico has been one of America s strongest allies. If it can be treated in this manner, is there hope for others to avoid being targeted?The Trump order to ban the entry of citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries has caused not only anger in the affected countries but also uncertainty among people in other developing countries who fear they may also be targeted in future. The executive order also suspended the admission of all refugees into the US. If made permanent, this measure signals the end of a long tradition of the US to welcome a limited number of people escaping from troubled countries.In some of these countries, the troubles that prompted them to leave resulted from interventions or interference by the US and its Western allies. One draft order calls for at least a 40% cut in US funding for international organisations and terminating funds for any international body that fits certain criteria.The other order calls for a review of all current and pending treaties and recommendations on which negotiations or treaties the US should leave.The New York Times says that if Trump signs the orders, the cuts could severely curtail the work of UN agencies which rely on billions of dollars in annual US contributions.The US has been the major creator of the post-Second World War system of international relations, with the UN at its centre.The UN has served as a crucial universal forum for international discussion and cooperation, including on peacekeeping and economic and social issues.It convenes leaders and representatives of almost all countries for meetings and conferences, with resolutions and declarations on a wide range of current affairs. Its agencies have supported global and national policy making and actions on economic development, the environment, human rights and refugees. The UN has been playing a critical positive role in providing a venue for developing countries to voice their opinions and take part in decision making on global affairs.The UN agencies have provided resources and support to developing countries to build their national capacities for economic and social development and in preventing and managing political conflicts.Of course the UN needs to be improved, including in democratisation of the Security Council and in giving more say to developing countries, especially on global economic and financial issues.But denigrating the UN s role and reducing funds for its operations would severely weaken the spirit and substance of international cooperation, to the detriment especially of developing countries.Another looming problem is that Trump looks intent on doing a complete turnaround on US environmental policies. This will have a grave effect on the world, both in terms of the physical environment itself and in turning back the clock on global efforts to tackle multiple environmental crises.Two major projects cancelled during Barack Obama s presidency on environmental and social grounds, the Keystone XL pipeline and the Dakota access pipeline, are being revived. The Clean Power Act, a centrepiece of Obama s efforts to address climate change, has been under attack.And all these even before the assumption of office of Trump s nominee for the new EPA chief, the Oklahoma attorney-general Scott Pruitt, who is well known for having sued the EPA 14 times. His selection by Trump was described by the New York Times as signalling Trump s determination to dismantle Obama s efforts to counter climate change and much of the EPA itself .This policy turnaround will negatively affect international efforts to combat the global environmental crisis. At this point it is not certain whether the US will remain in the Paris Agreement or even the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.It can, however, be expected that under Trump, the US will stop its funding of the Green Climate Fund.Another major action was Trump s move to withdraw the US from the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. He had pledged to do so but when he acted, on his first working day, it still came as a shock.Initially Australia and New Zealand tried to get the remaining 11 TPP countries to pledge they would continue to get the TPP to enter into force. But this has not gained traction.Thus, the TPP has been killed. Even if in future Trump or his successor has a change of heart, the public mood is such that the US Congress would be unlikely to approve.More important than Trump s action itself is what it represents in terms of the new US approach towards trade.The TPP was loaded to favour US interests in many ways. On the trade aspect, the US has lower tariffs than the developing country partners with which it did not yet have a trade agreement and thus stood to gain in terms of trade balance. On the non-trade aspects of the TPP, which the US under Obama had insisted upon, American companies would have gained in the areas of intellectual property, investment, government procurement and state-owned enterprises.Yet the TPP was unpopular with the American public, because it perceived that whatever gains the US would have would flow to the corporations and the elite, leaving the working and middle classes to face problems such as possible job losses from cheaper imports and relocation of factories abroad.With the demise of the TPP, developing countries which are its members regret the loss of their opportunity to gain greater access to the US market. But they are also spared from having to take on heavy obligations on investment, intellectual property, state-owned enterprises and other issues.The Trump move on the TPP is a prelude to other trade policies to be rolled out soon in pursuance of his America First strategy, which includes the subsidiary slogans Buy American and Hire Americans.Many developing countries which depend on the US for their exports and that presently host US companies or hope to attract new US investments, will be adversely affected by these policies, which together spell a new era of US protectionism.
