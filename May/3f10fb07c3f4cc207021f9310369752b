A recent study published in the South African Journal of Child Health which details widespread medication errors at paediatric wards at George Mukhari Hospital in Pretoria has been described by the Gauteng department of health as worrisome .This comes after a team of pharmacists documented 663 medication errors at the hospital s four paediatric wards after spending 16 weeks at the facility.According to the study most medication errors included incorrect dosing, omission of medication and medicine being given at the wrong time.DA shadow MEC for health in Gauteng Jack Bloom said he was horrified by the medication errors and that he strongly suspected that similar errors are happening in other hospitals in the province. The Gauteng health department should implement the researchers recommendations which include assigning a pharmacist to the paediatric wards improving training for doctors and nurses and the introduction of a digital database of medication errors, Bloom said.Department spokesperson Khutso Rabothata said the department would engage the journal and get to the bottom of the issues that have been raised .The department did not say whether or not disciplinary action was taken against staff found to have made medication errors that could lead to permanent harm or even death.The study also found that the error resulted in some level of harm in one of three patients.However, no patients suffered permanent harm or died as pharmacists intervened to avoid major errors according to the study.Researchers recommended the establishment of a digital medication errors database and the training of nurses and doctors among some of the measures to prevent a recurrence of such mistakes. 701478-TNA REPORTER
