Two men allegedly involved in the OR Tambo International Airport heist will appear at the Kempton Park Magistrate&#8217;s Court on Friday.Mosiwa Steven Motani, 35, and Khululekai Sibanda, 31, are facing charges of robbery after they made away with millions in foreign currency earlier this month at the airport.Meanwhile, the other five suspect s bail was postponed to March 28 and 29.The two suspects were released last week on a R5000 bail each.On Tuesday night, acting national police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane said it was highly regrettable that a member of the South African Police Service was among the first two suspects to be arrested. This confirms our version of not ruling out the possibility of collusion or an inside job, Phahlane said.The well-organised gang, clad in police uniforms, breached a secure unit of the airport before making off with about R24m.The gang were driving marked police vehicles when they entered the cargo unit of the airport.Two of the cars used in the heist were found last Wednesday in Mamelodi, Pretoria. However, it turned out the vehicles were not registered to the SAPS.-TNA Reporter
