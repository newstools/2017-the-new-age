Paris Saint-Germain&#8217;s Kylian Mbappe, at 18 the most expensive French player of all time, said Sunday he wanted to &#8220;mark the history&#8221; of the French capital with his new club.Mbappe, who hails from the northeastern Parisian surburb of Bondy, joined PSG from Monaco on a season-long loan last week in a deal that will make him the second most expensive footballer in history.His overall transfer fee could rise to 180 million euros ($215 million) including add-ons, which would make Mbappe second only to new team-mate Neymar on the all-time list of costliest transfers.&#8220;Big players have marked history in their country whether with the national team or their club,&#8221; Mbappe said in an interview with TF1, adding that it would have been premature to have left France.&#8220;What I want to do is to really mark the history of my city. PSG was really the project that allowed me to carry on my progress while playing.&#8221;Asked whether the arrival of Neymar from Barcelona for a record 222 million euros affected his decision to join PSG, Mbappe said: &#8220;No.&#8220;Nonetheless, to play with Neymar is really something extraordinary. We all know the player he is. PSG already interested me but with Neymar it&#8217;s true that it was an extra boost.&#8221;When you arrive at a club like that, which has the ambition of becoming the best club in the world, you have the ambition to win everything.&#8220;The Champions League is part of those competitions so we&#8217;ll play to win everything.&#8221;French pundits were left purring about Mbappe, Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger telling TF1 he had the potential &#8220;to become a Pele&#8221;, and 1998 World Cup winner Bixente Lizarazu claiming he was &#8220;more complete&#8221; than France&#8217;s record goal scorer Thierry Henry at the same age.Mbappe scored his first international goal in France&#8217;s 4-0 victory over the Netherlands on Thursday, coming off the bench to net at the death.-AFP
