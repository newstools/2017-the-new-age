The Kempton Park Magistrate s Court has postponed judgment in the case of Forensic investigator Paul O Sullivan. O&#8217;Sullivan appeared in court on Wednesday on alleged immigration charges and the matter was postponed to June 2. He was arrested at OR Tambo International Airport last year, as it was believed that he wanted to flee the country. He was arrested in front of his two daughters, who were on their way to attend school in England. At the time, O Sullivan said his reason for using his Irish passport was because his life was in danger stating that Czech criminal Radovan Krejcir had ordered a hit on his life. It is believed that a police task team had been investigating O Sullivan for allegedly carrying out illegal surveillance. The 60-year-old was detained for violating Immigration Act Section 26. O Sullivan s legal adviser said the private investigator was not attempting to flee the country at the time but was accompanying his two daughters to London where they attend school. He is facing facing a charge of contravening the Immigration Act and was granted R20,000 bail in 2016. Speaking outside the court on Wednesday, O Sullivan said: They took away my passport and they didn&#8217;t want to give it to me and the court ordered that they must give it back to me and they refused, today(Wednesday) when the court made the ruling, the guy with the passport ran out of the court and I went after him, said O Sullivan. He said the state has been violent towards him. It was made crystal clear on the email of the 15 of March which was handed by the state as evidence and in that email I made it clear that I was launching cases against Phahlane for corruption and indeed I linked certain family members of Zuma to some of the individuals I mentioned on that email,&#8221; he said. He added that he has been arrested twice and he is getting fed up with this matter. TNA Reporter
