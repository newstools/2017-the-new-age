The Ramotshere Moiloa local municipality has established new ward committees that are expected to speed up service delivery in communities.It was part of the ANC s recommendations after the August 3 local government elections that ward committees be created to improve communication between leaders and members of the public.The ANC instructed all municipalities to establish ward committees to work with the councillors to assist in fast-tracking service delivery.In Ramotshere Moiloa, wards were reduced from 20 to 19.After the new demarcation some wards were divided into two or more sections thus cutting two different traditional leaders, creating confusion within the communities.However, the office of the council speaker together with the traditional leaders worked together to ensure the success of establishing the ward committees and embarked on an awareness campaign educating the communities on the new arrangement brought about by the demarcation process.Council speaker Moiloa Tiro pleaded with the community to accept the changes and said service delivery would not be affected by the changes.Moiloa said ward committees were crucial in the local government system as they were the link between the councillor and the community.The ward committee system is also said to play a critical role in giving meaning to the notion of the people shall govern . This is so because local government is regarded as the level of the government closest to the people and ward committees are a way of ensuring citizens give their input into the decisions local councils make, Moiloa said.The South African Local Government Association (Salga), which is the only representative of all municipalities, reiterated ward committees are important in fostering relations between ward councillors and key stakeholders at ward level, such as traditional councils and community development workers.In ensuring ward committees knew their role, a two-day induction was conducted by the department of local government and human settlements and Salga in Zeerust town hall.In attendance were 190 ward committee members, councillors, representatives from provincial government and municipal officials. Those elected to the new structures promised to work for the benefit of the communities.ELFAS TORERAIelfast@thenewage.co.za
