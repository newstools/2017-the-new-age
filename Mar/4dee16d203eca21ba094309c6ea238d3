Oakbay has argued the declaratory order sought by the Finance Minister is purely hypothetical as it won t have any binding impact on future ministers.Representing Oakbay, Advocate Cedric Puckrin insisted that any declaratory order granted in the case would not have any future effect as it was too narrowly defined and would not stop anyone petitioning for help in the future.&#8221; The declaratory order has to mean something and not just be a dead letter, which it is in our opinion,&#8221; said Puckrin.Gordhan has asked the North Gauteng High Court for a declaratory order that it is not required by law to intervene in the relationship between the Oakbay group and the four major banks.Puckrin added that Gordhan had wasted the court&#8217;s time with an idle application based on a matter of settled law.Meanwhile according to Absa, the dispute between Oakbay and Gordhan is important to clarify the boundary between where executive power ends and private autonomy starts.The submission was made earlier by Advocate David Unterhalter who was representing ABSA which is party to the case.&#8221; There is an important demarcation that this declaratory order is making between where public powers end and where private decisions are made and whether there is autonomy to make those private decisions,&#8221; Unterhalter said.&#8220;Drawing that line is fundamentally important not just to the minster and any other person who occupies that office but it is also important to regulators and in this instance the banks who are subject to the exercise of public powers, said Unterhalter. They need to know within what realm they are subject to private autonomy and decision making and in what realm are they subject to public intervention.&#8221;While Advocate Alfred Cockrell, representing Nedbank, argued that Oakbay had wanted the Finance Minister to exercise an &#8220;extra-legal&#8221; function by asking him to intervene in the dispute between the banks and Oakbay.&#8220;The minister says he does not have the power to intervene but correspondence shows that Oakbay was pushing the minister to exercise power they say they don t dispute, Cockrell said.&#8220;Oakbay is now arguing that they wanted the Finance Minister to change law so he could intervene in bank fight.&#8221;-TNA Reporter
