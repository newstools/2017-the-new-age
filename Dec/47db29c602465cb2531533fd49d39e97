Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng has on Wednesday been inaugurated as the chancellor of the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN). Mogoeng was appointed by the UKZN council as chancellor in August and will serve in the position for four years. The chief justice is the third chancellor to hold office at UKZN having succeeded Dr Zweli Mkhize who served as the university’s chancellor for two terms. The university council Chairperson Vukile Mehana said they are looking forward working with the Judge in his first term of office. “We welcome Justice Mogoeng to the university and we are looking forward to working with him for the next four years. “We are confident that the wealth of knowledge and experience that he brings with him will be instrumental in fulfilling his duties in this critical role,” Mehana said. UKZN’s vice-chancellor and principal, Dr Albert van Jaarsveld, echoed Mehana’s sentiments. “He is no doubt one of the best legal minds ever produced by this country and we are proud to welcome him to the UKZN family,” Van Jaarsveld said. In appointing Mogoeng, the university said that in all the positions he has held including his current one as chief justice of the Constitutional Court, he had “displayed dedication, diligence, integrity and honesty which are characteristics that are in line with the university’s values”.
