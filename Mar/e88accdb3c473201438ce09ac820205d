The court application brought by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan involving Oakbay Investments is expected to be heard in the North Gauteng High Court tomorrow.Gordhan wants the court to pronounce that he cannot be forced to intervene in the dispute between Oakbay and the four South African banking institutions Absa, FNB, Standard Bank and Nedbank that closed down the company s accounts last year.In his court papers, Gordhan said the application was for declaratory relief arising from a dispute relating to powers of intervention by the government in relation to the closing of private clients accounts by registered banks.In his application, Gordhan argues that the national and international legal regime does not permit ministerial intervention in the closure of bank accounts least of all in the context of legal obligations imposed to protect the banking system and prevent them becoming vehicles for money laundering, terrorist financing and other unlawful activities .However, Oakbay is opposing the application, describing the minister s application as superfluous and marred with factual and legal errors.The company argues that there was no need for Gordhan to go to court, because nobody asked him to intervene in the first place. The minister has essentially asked the court to insert itself into the functioning of the executive branch. It would be bizarre if every empowered government official receiving a request for assistance or counsel, races to court to seek a declaration that he/she does not have to act on the request, the company says in its court papers.The court case also includes a document forming part of an affidavit by Gordhan alleging that between 2012 and early last year, Oakbay had made more than 70 suspicious transactions amounting to more than R6bn.The document was given to Gordhan by the Financial Intelligence Centre.Oakbay dismissed the FIC affidavit as a deliberate smear campaign against the Gupta family, the main shareholders in Oakbay Investments, and argues that it has a right to access the documents on which the FIC affidavit was based because its release created a wrong public perception that it was involved in dubious and corrupt affairs.In January, Oakbay acting CEO Ronica Ragavan said Gordhan s application was just an excuse to make this misleading smear public .She described it as a smokescreen to persuade the general public that the group and the family are involved in dubious and inappropriate transactions .Dudu Dubedudud@thenewage.co.za
