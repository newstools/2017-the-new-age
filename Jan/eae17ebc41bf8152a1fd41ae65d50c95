BAROKA FC are prepared to give new coach Jacob Sakala whatever he requires to help the club meet its new target of remaining in the Premier Soccer League. When Bakgaga arrived in the PSL at the beginning of the season they were confident they would sweep the boards, winning every title on offer. But so far, it has been the opposite of what the rookies hoped for.They lag at the foot of the PSL table with just 12 points from 15 matches. Baroka have been forced to lower their expectations. The club s CEO Morgan Mammila has started to speak more about the team s survival. What we need from coach Sakala is to save the team from relegation and then after that we are going to plan for the future, Mammila said. However, the coach has made a plea to the management to buy him at least two more players with top tier experience to accomplish his mission. He will get what he needs because all of us can see where we are lacking, it is a matter of time before we get quality players, Mammila said.The club had already signed five players before Sakala s arrival. Three of them have played in the PSL with former Orlando Pirates players Helder Pelembe and Siphamandla Sangweni brought in to strengthen the ailing squad. Jose Garcia joined from fellow rookies from Highlands Park.The team has also signed two goalkeepers, Abashoni Tshinuna, formerly with Black Leopards and Ayanda Dlamini from Alexandra United. Mammila believes they can still make the top five but will be happy if Sakala leads them to a top eight slot, which will be a great achievement for rookies.sithembisod@thenewage.co.za-Sithembiso Dindi
