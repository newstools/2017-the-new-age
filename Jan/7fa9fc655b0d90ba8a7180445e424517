The situation was calm in Botleng township and the neighbouring areas of Delmas yesterday following a violent protest on Monday morning.Residents went on the rampage demanding that a technical and vocational education and training college be built in the township like in other neighbouring municipalities.Among others, the protest saw a tanker travelling on the N12 being hijacked and set alight by the protesters after they blockaded the busy national road. They also blocked other alternative routes such as the R42 and R555 with burning tyres, rocks and other objects.The police said the vehicle was driving from Johannesburg to Emalahleni.However, the police have vowed to take a tough stance on those who continue to undermine the law of the country by infringing other people s rights and destroying property, staging protests to voice dissatisfaction over the provision of services and other issues.Provincial police spokesperson Gerald Sedibe told The New Age that charges of public violence and malicious damage to property were opened for further investigation.Sedibe said the police were confident that those involved in the matter would soon be arrested.He said there were no injuries reported during the unrest after a large number of police were despatched to monitor the situation. The situation was back to normal by today. Our preliminary investigation found that the tanker was passing through the N12 when it approached the protesters who then set it on fire.The occupants managed to survive unharmed seemingly after they complied with the demands of the protesters and avoided putting their lives at risk, Sedibe said. The protesters are complaining about the lack of a college in the area. We are probing charges of malicious damage to property and public violence.We also want to caution the provincial citizens at large that although they have the right to express their complaints through protests, they also need to exercise that right within the law.
