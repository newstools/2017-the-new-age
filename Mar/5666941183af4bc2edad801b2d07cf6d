A new poll Thursday showed centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron for the first time beating the far right&#8217;s Marine Le Pen in the initial round of the French presidential elections next month.Macron&#8217;s lead comes as a growing list of backers from both the left and the centre throw their support behind the 39-year-old former economy minister who is trying to upend France&#8217;s traditional politics.The Harris Interactive poll showed Macron taking 26 percent of the vote on April 23 &#8212; a six-point gain in two weeks &#8212; compared to 25 percent for National Front leader Le Pen, who had long been leading in the first round.In the likely event that no one wins an outright majority, a run-off between the two top candidates will be held on May 7.The Harris poll shows Macron would take 65 percent of that vote to Le Pen&#8217;s 35 percent.Though no polls currently show her winning, anti-immigration nationalist Le Pen is hoping to emulate the shock success of President Donald Trump in US elections last year.In a boost to his campaign on Wednesday, Macron won the backing of Socialist former Paris mayor Bertrand Delanoe who called him &#8220;a reformist, a European and a realist&#8221;.Delanoe, who oversaw the French capital from 2001 to 2014, told France Inter radio he backed Macron because it was essential to &#8220;throw the most weight possible behind the candidate who can beat Madam Le Pen in the first round&#8221;.His stance on the prospect of a Le Pen presidency was echoed by France&#8217;s ambassador to Japan, who on Wednesday broke diplomatic protocol by stating publicly that he would refuse to serve if she won.&#8220;If the French tragedy comes to pass and leads to her election, I would withdraw from all my diplomatic functions,&#8221; Thierry Dana, 60, wrote in a column in Le Monde newspaper.&#8211; Fresh blow for Fillon &#8211;A former investment banker who quit the Socialist government in August to prepare a bid for the presidency, Macron has risen fast in opinion polls, but has never won elected office.In remarks on International Women&#8217;s Day on Wednesday, he suggested he would ideally name a woman as prime minister if he were to win the keys to the Elysee Palace.&#8220;To be honest, it&#8217;s too easy to say it this evening. But I&#8217;ve spoken to others, starting with men, and that&#8217;s what I wish really,&#8221; he said, when asked if he would name a female PM at a public rally in Paris.An already unpredictable French election has become even harder to call given the legal woes afflicting the conservative challenger Francois Fillon, who is embroiled in a &#8220;fake jobs&#8221; scandal.In another blow, the investigative paper Le Canard Enchaine published new claims late Tuesday that the scandal-hit Fillon had failed to declare an interest-free loan of 50,000 euros ($53,000) from a billionaire friend.Once the frontrunner in the race, Fillon has slipped to third in the polls and the gap between him and Macron and Le Pen appears to be widening.Delanoe&#8217;s support for the Macron campaign is a blow for the Socialist candidate for the presidency, Benoit Hamon, whose hard-left policies have led some commentators to dismiss him as unelectable.Macron still has his detractors though, with veteran conservative former prime minster Alain Juppe describing him this week as &#8220;politically naive&#8221;.&#8211; &#8216;Forgotten&#8217; middle classes &#8211;Macron told AFP in an interview Tuesday that he will defend France&#8217;s middle classes, which he says have been ignored by the left and right.He claimed that both the outgoing Socialist government under President Francois Hollande &#8212; in which he served &#8212; and their right-wing opponents have let down the middle classes, assailed by job cuts and an increasing tax burden.&#8220;The right talks about the France that is succeeding, the left talks about the workers who are struggling the most,&#8221; he said.&#8220;They have forgotten the middle classes.&#8221;Macron claimed that snubbing middle earners had led to Britain&#8217;s Brexit vote and to Trump&#8217;s victory in the United States.&#8220;Democracies that have succeeded economically by depending only on the classes that succeed&#8230; while forgetting the middle classes, are shattered by the rise of extremes,&#8221; he said.-AFP
