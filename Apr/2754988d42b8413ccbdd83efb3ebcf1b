If Kaizer Chiefs can take the same fighting spirit they displayed against Acornbush FC in the Nedbank Cup to league matches, they should have few problems as they try to achieve the double, according to midfielder Siphiwe Tshabalala.Chiefs came from 1-0 down to win the match 2-1 on Sunday with two quick goals coming in the last 11 minutes of the match. Shaba now wants to see the same tenacity, starting from tomorrow when they meet an improving Bloemfontein Celtic at Dr Molemela Stadium in the Absa Premier League. Striker Gustavo Paez was the hero after he came on from the bench to strike twice late in the match, sending Amakhosi into the quarterfinals of the competitions. I think it was a close one, we knew that it was not going to be easy. They were hyped up and looking forward to the game, Tshabalala said. But we just had to keep our focus. They got an early goal and we didn t panic, we kept our cool and we kept the ball circulating properly. I think the coach made good technical changes as well. Two goals in the last 10 minutes shows character, it s also experience and we achieved our objectives to come here, do the business and move on. The former Bafana Bafana midfielder also feels they now have decent quality on the bench after Paez, William Twala and Hendrick Ekstein came on in the second half and changed the complexion of the game. If we maintain our work ethic, work as a team and show character, we will get there, Tshabalala said. Ramahlwe Mphahlele was not playing and Kgotso Moleko did well, so at least there are options now. Everyone is pulling their weight. We are expecting a tough game against Celtic it s an away game. It s a big game because they are desperate. They are not in a good position on the log standings and we are focusing on our journey one game at a time. Chiefs are third on the log and will be looking to put pressure on log leaders Cape Town City and Bidvest Wits with a win tomorrow.-Neville Khoza|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
