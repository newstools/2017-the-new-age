The province s richest municipality, Rustenburg, recently tabled a R5.2bn budget for the 2017-18 financial year that seeks to take the platinum city to new heights.Executive mayor Mpho Khunou said it was his vision and that of newly appointed municipal manager, Nqobile Sithole, to ensure that the dream of a world-class city, where all citizens enjoy a high quality of life was realised.Statistics from a community survey done by Statistics South Africa show that Rustenburg remains North West s economic hub.The city has a population of 626522, with each person looking forward to better services.Following the adoption of the budget, Khunou said the key issues the municipality had to deal with were the delivery of quality basic services, developing, diversifying and strengthening the local economies, building spatially integrated communities, and preserving and conserving the natural environment. We also need to ensure sound fiscal management with the achievement of clean administration, and we must intensify the fight against crime, fraud and corruption and promote social cohesion, Khunou said.The mayor said extensive consultations were done with residents, the business sector, political parties and the provincial and national treasuries before the budget was compiled. Notwithstanding the fact that not all the political parties supported the budget, all made valuable input about the future of the municipality. These suggestions were taken into consideration as Rustenburg moves to becoming a metro and a world-class city, where all citizens enjoy a high quality of life, Khunou said.The mayor spoke about the difficult economic climate in which the budget was crafted but gave a detailed account on how the municipality would seek to overcome the risk and uncertainty posed by a waning mining sector.The bulk of the allocation goes towards infrastructure development, with focus on the Rustenburg Rapid Transport (RRT) system.The RRT is changing the city s transport landscape and will lift Rustenburg into the league of other major cities where a bus rapid transit system is in operation.Like other municipalities, however, the bulk of the capital funding is from conditional grants. The capital budget is funded from the national and provincial grants, namely the public transport infrastructure grant and the municipal infrastructure grant. The total capital budget is inclusive of the Rustenburg Water Services Trust. There are no projects funded from internal reserves as the municipality works towards increasing its reserves over the 2017-18 period through effective and sound financial management, the mayor said.Concern was raised over the tariff setting of the city, with some councillors objecting to proposed increases. Tariff setting was an integral part of the compilation of the budget. The input costs, national and local economic challenges and outlook, together with the affordability of services, were some of the key considerations in the determination of cost reflective tariffs of the municipality. The increase in tariffs was one of the areas of concern raised by the DA. However, through rigorous consultation with the political parties, a downward adjustment was made to the proposed tariffs, as well as to the 50-50 method of collection of arrears through the prepaid system. The original proposal was a 90-10 application that would have placed severe financial pressure on our consumers, Khunou said.The budget factors in the plight of indigent residents, who would have subsidised charges when it comes to services. Through the social package there is relief for consumers classified as approved indigent in the form of free basic services comprised of 50kW of electricity, 6kL of water, refuse and sanitation, Khunou said.In a bid to improve the delivery of services and general performance of the municipality, Khunou said a number of measures would be implemented.He said the municipality would be made up of qualified, driven and motivated employees capable of delivering the strategic and set objectives. We will implement systems to ensure accuracy and completeness of billing, timely actual billing of customers and delivery of customer statements. There will be key focus on revenue protection and enhancement, stringent credit and debt collection initiatives with the objective of improving the collection rate from 82% to 101%. The municipality cannot achieve its vision without the commitment of citizens towards the payment for services received, he said.Water conservation initiatives will be implemented to make sure minimum to no loss of water in and around the city. There is a need to reduce electricity losses over the next three years through the electrification of informal settlements as an initiative to address losses through illegal connection.The municipality will also focus on cost containment measures and sound supply chain management practices with a key focus on contractor management to ensure value for money in all transaction, Khunou said.There is also a new approach to channel the city s economic future towards agriculture, manufacturing, property development and financial services in an effort to develop an alternative to mining. Implementing both the operating programmes and capital projects contained in the budget in line with the revised supply chain management and transformation framework policy will encompass a more aggressive measure to empower SMMEs. The policy prescribes that there must be 30% local content in terms of the supply chain awards made by the municipality. We will build internal reserves to enable the municipality to drive the local economic agenda and enhance service delivery through investment in new infrastructure, the mayor said.Other issues raised include rolling out of performance management contracts for all employees in the municipality and investigating allegations of financial misconduct whenever they are raised against officials.Rustenburg has not attained a clean audit in the recent past and the goal is to steer the municipality towards a clean bill of health.Some opposition parties objected to the budget but there were enough votes to push it through.ELFAS TORERAIelfast@thenewage.co.za
