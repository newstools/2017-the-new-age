&nbsp;A promotional video by the Solidariteit caused a stir on social media .The video which starting showing an Afrikaans woman watching on her iPad showing the EFF Leader Julius Malema saying :&#8220;Once we take over power Afrikaners males you will know your place.&#8221;The video which is only showing white Afrikaans-speaking adults and children watching shows Malema saying:&#8220;Victory will only be victory if the land is returned in the rightful owners, This is our continent and it belongs to us, we want our land and it must come with everything.&#8221;It then shows the President of the Republic Jacob Zuma singing &#8220;Sizobadubula&#8221; meaning &#8220;we are going to shoot them&#8221;.Solidarity then claims to &#8220;put its foot down on selective racism and the time has come for us to stand together&#8221;.Solidarity said it needs the support of 200 000 people to enable it to lodge a complaint nationally and internationally, and asks if &#8220;you&#8221; are one of the 200 000.However, some on social media are outraged saying the video acting against racism itself is racist .The institution seems to be evoking the same racial identities when asking Afrikaners to unite, they argue.In February, Solidarity launched a mass campaign on selective racism and against racial bullying. A collective complaint dealing with this phenomenon, which will be lodged with the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC), forms part of the campaign.Th instituion says &#8220;the collective complaint will also quash the notion that only white people are racist, and the SAHRC will also be requested to express and will also be requested to take a stand in this regard&#8221;. &#8220;We are all fed up with double standards.Solidarity will take a collective complaint to various local and international forums and we need the support of ten thousand of people, &#8221; the organisation says.It then calls on respondents to call and donate through their calls. and for the Afrikaners to sms Race to a certain number .TNA Reporter
