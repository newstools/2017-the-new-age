President Jacob Zuma received a warm welcome from thousands of ANC supporters at the unveiling ceremony of the tombstone of late cabinet minister Collins Chabane at Xikundu in Malamulele on Saturday.Zuma described Chabane as a gallant and disciplined strategist who underwent guerilla warfare training in Mozambique during the dark days of apartheid and white minority rule in South Africa. We are celebrating the life of a freedom fighter of note, a disciplined all rounder in the ANC.He was in the national executive committee of the ANC since 1990 until he died. He was a hard worker and disciplined cadre, Zuma said.Chabane was the minister of public service and administration at the time he, together with his two two body guards, Lawrence Lentsoane and Lesiba Sekele, died when their VW Touareg SUV ploughed into a truck on the N1 outside Polokwane on March 15, 2015.Speaking on behalf of the family Matimba Chabane, the late minister s son, said the tombstone was a monument for their father, who dedicated his life to the liberation of all South Africans. To us this is now the unveiling of the celebration of his life. More than that we don t view his tombstone as just a tombstone. To us it is a monument, it is a symbol of what we aspire to be and the man who inspired us. The ceremony was also attended by traditional leaders, politicians, traditional healers and members of the public. Zuma thanked all the speakers for paying tribute to the fallen hero and took a swipe at people who used funeral or memorial services to sow divisions within the ANC. I am happy that you have not used the name of Collins Chabane to fight your battles. There is a new culture that we must persuade ourselves not to do and that is using memorial services to fight our political battles, the president said.MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
