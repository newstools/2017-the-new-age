Family and friends will on Friday gather at the Grace Bible Church in Soweto to pay tribute to the pop legend, Robbie Malinga. Malinga died on Christmas day after being diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer June last year. Malinga’s brother Bheki said this during a press briefing at the music maestro’s Dainfern home Wednesday morning. Friends TK Nciza, Doc Shebeleza, Oscar Mlangeni and a representative from Universal Music Group, were among those gathered for the announcement of both the memorial and funeral arrangements. “We learnt of his condition in June last year and by the time we found out, it was already at stage four so you can imagine how devastated we were,” the musician’s brother said. “Fortunately we are a close-knit family and the support we have been receiving from both sides of the families has helped us cope with the fact that he died.” His father, Coleman Malinga, said he would forever miss his voice and impeccable dress sense. “We were all devastated, but he was strong about it even though at times he was ill,” his father said. Malinga will be buried on Tuesday next week. -TNA Reporter
