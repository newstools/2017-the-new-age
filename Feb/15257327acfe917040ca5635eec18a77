The Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (NMMU) has distanced itself from &#8216;discriminatory comments&#8217; allegedly made by a staff member using the University email system.A secretary at NMMU&#8217;s Chemistry department sent an email last week using her work email to express her dislike of a Mosque situated in Westering, Port Elizabeth.In her email she said: &#8220;the residence of Westering have tolerated enough of this centre and would gladly see the back of this. This is a decent residential area and wish to keep it that way.&#8221;&#8220;It seems that Muslims love to push their religion on the western world and expect us to tolerate and accept this, but it&#8217;s about time that we as stand up and say enough is enough. If they want their so-called centre then they must have it on their own country not and tuff.&#8221;NMMU secretary under fire for racial email condemning Muslim prayer sites (mosques)-story to follow @AfriNewsAgency pic.twitter.com/ffUeLJHI6S Raahil Sain (@RaahilSain) February 20, 2017A formal complaint was sent to NMMU and immediate action was taken with the university launching an internal investigation into the possible violation of the University policies and values.
