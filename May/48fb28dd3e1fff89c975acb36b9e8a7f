The continued outsourcing of security, cleaning and catering workers at the Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) is agitating workers at institution to plan to embark on a strike action, Outsourcing Must Fall (OMF)national spokesperson Mametlwe Sebei said on Wednesday.This follows a decision taken at a mass meeting by the workers at the weekend.In February 2016, an agreement between TUT management and the outsourced workers representatives had been signed to commit the university to convene an Insourcing task team that would include the workers in the insourcing talks .Sebei said it was disappointing that the university appear to be reneging on last year s agreement, resulting in serious claims that TUT had not made a full commitment to decision taken at last week s meeting .He said workers do not want to enter talks with a gun to their head . They demanded that TUT withdrew the new security tenders, declaring that only then would workers be willing to participate in discussions.Sebei said in the past weeks the workers had become aware that management had reneged on the most fundamental agreement to end outsourcing at the university in which workers would be paid R5000 per month.-TNA Reporter
