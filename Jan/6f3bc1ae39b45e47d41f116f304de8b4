Foreign tourism to the Western Cape in December has increased by 29% year on year, MEC for economic opportunities Alan Winde said this week.The majority of the foreign visitors during the peak season were from Germany and the UK, while domestic visitors were mostly from Gauteng. Nine out of 10 tourist attractions reported an increase in visitor numbers over the peak season, Winde said. By far the greatest attraction was Table Mountain National Park with more than 400000 visitors.Winde said that the increase in visitors at key attractions, including the Cango Caves and Robben Island, was the pay-off from a new focused approach to growing tourism and a surge in private investment. There are some areas where there s some flat-lining, but of course we need to go back to the drawing board and see what we can do differently. The tourism industry provides more than 200000 jobs and aims to create an additional 100000 by 2019.Cape Town was ranked among the top 50 so-called global cities in the world. These were cities which were attractive to the ultra-rich when they decided on where to buy luxury real estate in a city, the Wealth-X Global Property Handbook reported. It was compiled in collaboration with Warburg Realty and Barnes International Realty.The first edition of the handbook reviewed the luxury real estate market and explored the buying habits of the world s wealthiest people. These ultra-high net worth individuals have a net worth of $30m (about R400m) or more. The ideal city property is expected to satisfy a range of practical, emotional and financial considerations.Cape Town ranks 37th, one notch below Dubai which is 36th. The Mother City s attractiveness for luxury purchases by the very rich was seen as being on a par with Oslo in Norway, Basel in Switzerland and Moscow in Russia.-Tatenda Chiriseri|provinces@thenewage.co.za
