A 47-YEAR-OLD woman and her threeyear-old daughter have been found battered at their home in Booysens Park.Police said on Saturday evening a concerned neighbour went to the house and when there was no response after she knocked on the door, she entered. They found the mother and daughter with multiple head injuries.At this stage, the motive for the brutal attack is unknown and a case of attempted murder is being investigated by the SAPS Bethelsdorp detectives, police said. The injured persons were taken to hospital. Bethelsdorp police are now seeking the community s assistance in the investigation and have appealed for information. Anyone with information should contact officer Ben Killian at Bethelsdorp on 082 442 1633 or the nearest police station.Acting cluster commander for Mount Road cluster, Brig Keith Meyer, has condemned the attack. As South Africans we have an obligation to report violence and abuse.As we observe Child Protection Week we need to reinforce the duty of everyone in the protection of children from violence, exploitation and abuse, he said. Meanwhile, in line with child protection week last week, Hankey SAPS adopted the theme Act Against Abuse Stop women and child abuse and concluded activities in the Humansdorp cluster by hosting a special outreach programme.Members from the station prepared hot soup and bread for the community in Stofwolk in Hankey. Members chose this area because many of the crimes against women and children occur there.As part of the programme a little girl was crowned queen, because she answered the most questions pertaining to the police emergency number 10111 correctly, police said. 701656TNA REPORTER
