THE coalition running the Nelson Mandela Bay (NMB) administration has been put to the test as conflict between the partners was laid bare during a council meeting in Port Elizabeth. Deputy mayor from the UDM, Mongameli Bobani walked out of the meeting after a disagreement with mayor Athol Trollip over the firing of the executive director of corporate affairs and the appointment of the current municipal manager Johan Mettler. The coalition was formed after the 2016 local government elections between the DA, which is the majority party, UDM, Cope and ACDP. Bobani explained why they walked out. Then administration of the former government, led by Danny Jordaan, appointed Mrs Vuyo Zitumane for a period of three months. This municipal manager, instead of him signing a contract with Mrs Vuyo Zitumane, he signed a contract with her company that is in contradiction of Section 56 of section (1) of the Municipal Structures Act. Also, the expulsion of Mr Mod Ndoyana as the executive director of corporate affairs we are saying as the UDM the municipal manager doesn t have the right to fire a section 56 manager. Trollip said the disagreement won t affect the coalition. We will discuss the issues, it s premature for me to discuss with the media what the dynamics are, obviously there are dynamics and this is a coalition government, so it s not easy. We re not an outright majority, so we will go and negotiate with our coalition partners to find common ground, Trollip said. SABCnew
