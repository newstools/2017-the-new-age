The new coach of Baroka FC Jacob Sakala believes a bit of motivation for the team and a few experienced players can help him succeed in his bid to save the club to avoid a swift return to the National First Division.Baroka s first season in the PSL had not been smooth sailing under the leadership of coach Kgoloko Thobejane and this has resulted in the management bringing in someone with top-flight experience.The Limpopo-based outfit have struggled to find traction in the top tier.They are now perched at the bottom of the log with 12 points from 15 matches.However, Sakala, who joined the club last week, thinks it is not too late for the Premiership rookies to turn things around and turn the corner.He has asked the management to sign at least two experienced players before the end of the transfer window. The players need the motivation to get their mood in the right state, Sakala said. We need to work together as a team and be disciplined at the same time. There is nothing wrong with a bit of fun here and there because we need to be happy but we also need to work hard to get the results. The club has signed five players including two former Orlando Pirates players, Helder Pelembe and Siphamandla Sangweni.Sakala was tasked to help Black Aces survive the chop during the 2014-15 season when he was brought in to replace Clive Barker.SITHEMBISO DINDI
