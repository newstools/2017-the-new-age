This new government is set on curbing unnecessary expenditure through smart and forward-thinking governance, The office of the mayor said.Trollip added that, As we near the budget cycle, this promising change bodes well for the financial sustainability of the Municipality.&#8221;Meanwhile the ANC in the region says there is no proof that the deviation are reduced up to 90%.Nelson Mandela Bay ANC spokesperson Bricks Ndoni said the DA has taken over what the ANC started in the region. They must show us what they talking about, they must give people the municipal bank account so they can check. The ANC was leading the municipality and they cannot in any way claim that its their work that is why they can claim outcomes. Before the DA came in, we were doing so well so that is why they claim its their work now. The deviations is because of our work, we stopped deviations, said Ndoni. Sweeping changes are taking place in the Metro and many other positive developments await this city. Our mission is that we are informed by the need to change the fortunes and economic landscape of this metropolitan, said Trollip.TNA Reporter
