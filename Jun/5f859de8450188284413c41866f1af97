The African National Congress (ANC) today (Thursday) welcomed the chief justice Mogoeng Mogoeng s secret ballot judgment, and the way in which the court clarified the Speaker&#8217;s discretion in her decision-making processes.Spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said the Constitutional Court had shown that the country&#8217;s Constitution is to be regarded to be the highest law in the land, and that it has to be respected by all.However, Kodwa said he was adamant that the decision to remove president Zuma would come from the ANC, and only the ANC itself, and never from opposition oppositions.Kodwa has expressed the party s confidence in its chairperson and national Speaker Mbete to decide on the matter at hand. He also thanked the Constitutional Court for providing clarity. Our justices have defended the constitution as the supreme law. It s clear that the opposition parties went on a fishing expedition, Kodwa said.DA federal chairperson James Selfe said today s Constitutional Court decision represented victory for democracy for the country.&#8220;This is not just a victory for opposition parties; it is victory for all South Africans, to remove a toxic president,&#8221; Selfe added.He said the DA would write to the national Speaker for her to schedule a motion-of no confidence debate on the Zuma as soon as possible.-Sipho Jack&nbsp;
