The Leaders of the coalition agreement between Democratic alliance (DA) and United Democratic Movement (UDM) met in Cape Town to discuss the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality.The meeting was to delineate a way forward to settle challenges between the Executive Mayor of the Bay Athol Trollip and his deputy Mongameli Bobani.DA federal executive chairman James Selfe confirmed that the meeting was set up by the DA Leader Mmusi Maimane in his Cape Town office.Although none of the Leaders could be reached for a comment, Maimane s spokesman Graham Charters said there have been several of these meetings attended by the DA and UDM. They are all about resolving the impasse between the mayor and his deputy.In an interview with the Herald Charters said the agenda was about coming to an agreement on the way forward.UDM leader Bantu Holomisa had earlier reported that he had doubts about the future of UDM and DA coalition at the Nelson Metro Bay municipality.The projection of a bleak future follows a standoff between Mayor Athol Trollip and his Deputy Mongameli Bobani, an acrimony that has lasted for several months.Charters said this is not any kind of special meeting.&#8220;It is just a regular meeting between the two sides and another attempt to iron out the issues between the two men,&#8221; he said.Weeks ago Bobani was asked to leave the council meeting, he has been accusing the DA of not following the rules in terms of hiring, this was as a result of the different interpretation of the law in relation to the appointment of the city manager. He believed the appointment was unlawful.Although Bobani refused to speak about the content of the report or submissions. For the first time, the report was tabled and submissions by each side were made in front of coalition leaders,&#8221; he said.-TNA Reporter
