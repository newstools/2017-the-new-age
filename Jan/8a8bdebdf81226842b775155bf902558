Regions and branches of the African National Congress Youth League(ANCYL) are on Thursday holding demonstrations in various Absa establishments. Youth League Secretary General Njabulo Nzuza announced on Wednesday the planned demonstrations during a press conference hosted in Tshwane. During the briefing the Youth League hit out at Absa saying it believed the bank is guilty of “criminality” and “fraud” related to an apartheid era bailout of BANKORP which was acquired by Absa and should be made to pay back a sum of R2.2bn to the national fiscus.

They also called on South Africans to call Absa’s call center on Thursday “and ask them when are they paying back the money.” The Youth League also vowed to hold a mass demonstration against Absa in two weeks.

The League’s stance comes after Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema made a U-turn on his previous demand that Absa repay its apartheid-era debt. Malema rejected the campaign on Monday that Absa should pay back the R2.2bn bailout it received from the apartheid government. -TNA Reporter
