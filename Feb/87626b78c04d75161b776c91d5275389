Supersport United coach Stuart Baxter is spoilt for choice on who to select as his back-four pairing and defender Morgan Gould says this is a headache the players enjoy providing him with.With Tefu Mashamaite and Clayton Daniels now available in defence, Baxter will have the choice of who to select between Denwin Farmer and Gould. Gould said there is healthy competition at the club and this has resulted in United conceding so few goals this season. There are a lot of good youngsters at the club. Denwin is a quality player who is very energetic and has a long road ahead of him, Gould said. He is showing already at the age of 20 that I m among you guys . If he gains the experience we have, then he s on his way. It s good competition for all of us, it s healthy competition. We put one another through the paces at training and show the coach you know what we want is for you to have a headache . United have only conceded 10 goals in 15 matches and the availability of Mashamaite who is ready to make his debut after recovering from a knee injury will surely strengthen an already solid defence. We mustn t have a headache of thinking if one is going to be in the team and not. Matsatsantsa a Pitori will meet Free State Stars tonight at James Motlatsi Stadium aiming to return to the summit of the log with a convincing victory. They are unbeaten since the opening round and Gould warned they must remain grounded. We shouldn t getting ahead of ourselves, there is still a long way to go. Look at Mamelodi Sundowns and Bidvest Wits, they have games in hand so we can t be getting ahead of ourselves, Gould said. Each game that comes we must try to wrap up and work things out for ourselves. It s one of those things where we must work for ourselves and continue in the same vein that we are currently in.
