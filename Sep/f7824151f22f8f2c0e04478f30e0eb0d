Kevin Anderson spoiled the American party at the U.S. Open when the big-serving South African beat local favourite Sam Querrey 7-6(5) 6-7(9) 6-3 7-6(7) to reach his first grand slam semi-final on Tuesday.Anderson&#8217;s win ended the U.S. presence in the men&#8217;s draw while Sloane Stephens and Venus Williams have both qualified for the last four in the women&#8217;s draw.The 17th-seeded Querrey can blame himself for a meltdown in the first set tiebreak, where he lost five points in a row to allow Anderson into the lead under the lights on Arthur Ashe Stadium.The 31-year-old Anderson, seeded 28th, will face Spanish 12th seed Pablo Carreno Busta for a spot in Sunday&#8217;s final.&#8220;This is incredible, at this stage and playing on one of the most famous courts in the world, it feels absolutely fantastic,&#8221; said Anderson, who became the first South African player to reach the last four of the U.S. Open since tennis turned professional in 1968.&#8220;Losing the second set was really tough but I played each point at a time and it paid big dividends for me today.&#8221;The two big servers could not manage a break in the opening set and Querrey, who was hoping to be the first American male to make it to the last four here since Andy Roddick in 2006, moved 5-2 up in the tiebreaker but Anderson then played more freely and won five points in a row to take the lead.There was an early exchange of breaks in the second set with Querrey opening a 6-1 lead in the tiebreak before suffering another meltdown and finding himself trailing 8-7.This time, however, the 17th seed regrouped and equalised on his eighth set point when Anderson returned long, triggering a huge roar from the crowd.But the stands gradually cleared up as the match was sent deep into the night.Anderson got a decisive break in the sixth game of the third set as Querrey struggled with his first serve and the South African held twice, finishing it off with a forehand winner down the line to lead two sets to one.The fourth set was tightly contested again and went into another tiebreak.Querrey saved a first match point with an ace at 6-5, set up a set point at 7-6, which Anderson staved off by forcing his opponent to slice a backhand into the net.The second match point was good enough for Anderson, who dominated the rally until Querrey&#8217;s forehand sailed long.-Reuters
