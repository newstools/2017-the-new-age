New allegations of tender rigging related to national Treasury s Integrated Financial Management Systems (IFMS) project have emerged.Television news channel ANN7 has uncovered the alleged tender rigging in the award of a R461m contract for the government s ambitious IFMS project.The investigation uncovered alleged favouritism at the State Information Technology Agency (Sita) that handed the software licence for the project to US software giant Oracle on a platter.The irregularities relate to Sita s sudden and irrational decision to cancel a 2013 tender for software and services for the IFMS project for no ostensible reason other than that some bidders had been unable to meet the deadline for the submission of tenders.Oracle had not bid for the 2013 tender.One of the SMMEs which had bid for the tender, wrote to Sita when it showed its intention to cancel the tender saying they were not aware of any legal noncompliance which necessitated cancelling the tender.The fresh tender, floated by Sita in 2014 was strangely for software only blocking local SMMEs from the bidding process.At least three separate sources confirmed to ANN7 that the new tender was designed to allow Oracle into the fray and in a favourable position.ANN7 has in its possession at least two letters sent to Sita and the Treasury raising questions about the alleged irregularities in the IFMS tender process. The IFMS project is co-managed by Sita and the national Treasury.One of the bidders, SAP, even wrote twice to former Treasury director-general Lungisa Fuzile about a serious breach of governance in the tender process on April 7 and April 26, 2016 just prior to the awarding of the contract.But both letters were met with a stoic silence. The contract was eventually awarded to Oracle late last year.Sources suggest that competitor bid pricing for the 2013 tender was made visible to Oracle by insiders . A rival bidder wrote to Sita suggesting Oracle was permitted to alter its bid pricing after the closing date , that is, apart from other breaches in the procurement process.Hemant Bhoola, former chief director of IFMS, joined Oracle as a senior manager barely 90 days after the contract was formally awarded and now sits in a Johannesburg office, a clear conflict of interest that has not been questioned by anyone at Sita or the national Treasury.When contacted, Bhoola, now technology sales consulting director at Oracle SA, told ANN7 to direct (our) queries to the national Treasury . Our questions to Oracle were also met with a no comment response.ANN7 also had no answers to queries sent to the new Treasury director-general Dondo Mogajane about the alleged irregularities in the tender award.Making the situation worse is that the award of the software only contract to Oracle will definitely result in major cost overruns according to industry sources. The project may cost 10 times more because now services for customisation and implementing the software will have to be accounted for separately, Gilbert Parson, CEO of iAdapt, said.-Aditi Prasad
