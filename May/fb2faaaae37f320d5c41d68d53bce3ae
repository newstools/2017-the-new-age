The number of complaints against auction houses in South Africa has dropped by more than one third year on year and 2017’s numbers so far indicate this downward trend is set to continue. This is according to South African Institute of Auctioneers (SAIA) director Joff van Reenen. It was reported that the number of complaints against accredited auction houses dropped from 78 in 2015 to 49 last year with only 18 complaints submitted to the industry oversight body so far this year. Van Reenen said that settlements were reached in most cases last year and the average length of time from initial complaint submission to a ruling by the panel was two weeks. “SAIA member companies must abide by the settlements and/or rulings issued by the panel. “If they refuse, they will be subject to hearings and stand to have their SAIA accreditation revoked and their membership suspended, which is no trifling matter.” He said that the substantial reduction in the number of public complaints showed that on the whole auctioneers in South Africa conducted business ethically and transparently, but it also demonstrated the escalation in public awareness and understanding of the workings of the auction sale process in general. “Many complaints have been as a result of buyers or sellers not having the necessary information about the auction process, then crying foul afterwards. Technology and access to internet research is creating a much more educated modern auction client base,” he said -THELMA NGOMA|thelman@thenewage.co.za
