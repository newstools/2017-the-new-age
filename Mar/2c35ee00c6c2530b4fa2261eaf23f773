It takes something truly special for an athlete to perform to her maximum and strike gold under the sort of pressure Caster Semenya endured at the Rio Olympics. It s a force of will and character that separates top athletes from the rest, the sort which made Semenya the champion she is.The 800m gold medallist hasn t dazzled her home fans since her Olympic heroics in August, but she returns to the track at the ASA Speed Series in Potchefstroom tonight. Semenya will be joined at the Kenneth McArthur Athletics Stadium by fellow Olympics stars Sunette Viljoen and Akani Simbine in the keenly-awaited third leg Speed Series event, which also features foreign athletes.She began her post-Olympic season in emphatic fashion when claiming victory at the IAAF Diamond League in Zurich in September. It was after she defied critics and detractors as she won with a personal best of 1:55:28 and ended off the country s successful Olympic campaign in Brazil.Semenya will also be a star attraction as she makes a rare appearance in the Women s 3000m middle-distance events where she will face strong challenge from in-form distance specialist Kesa Molotsane and road runner Mapaseka Makhanya. Olympic silver medallist Viljoen will open her campaign as she prepares for her first global title challenge in London in August. In the sprints, national champion Alyssa Conley will line up in the women s 200m event as she gears up to defend her short-sprint crowns at the ASA Senior Championships.But eyes will also be on sprinter Akani Simbine, who dipped under 20 seconds for the first time since he clocked 19.95 over the half-lap distance in Pretoria earlier this month. He will come up again SA junior record holder Clarence Munyai, who crossed the line in 20.10 to finish second behind the Olympic 100m finalist at the same Gauteng North League meeting.In other events, national 400m hurdles record holder LJ van Zyl will face fellow Olympian Le Roux Hamman and promising teenager Kefilwe Mogawane, while former African Championships long jump bronze medallist Lynique Prinsloo will look to impress in her season opener in her specialist discipline.Several foreign athletes are also set to grace the meeting, with World Championships finalist and former African record holder Isaac Makwala of Botswana lining up in the men s 400m sprint. Neighbouring countries Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Mozambique as well as Qatar will also be represented in various disciplines.The pre-programme for the series starts at 5pm while the two-hour main programme begins at 7pm. Entry fee for spectators is R30. Students with registration cards and scholars in school uniform will have free entry.-Kgomotso Sethusha|kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
