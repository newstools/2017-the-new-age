Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane is expected to visit Lily Mine in Barberton on Monday to engage the mine s workers.Minister Zwane&#8217;s visit comes after Lily Mine workers and families staged a protest at the Mpumalanga African National Congress (ANC) Lekgotla in Mbombela on Saturday.During the protest the provincial ANC chair promised the people that he will arrange a meeting with Minister Zwane after the community demanded that the party&#8217;s provincial leaders should step in.Last year February a shaft at Lily Mine in Barberton, Mpumalanga, collapsed. Three mine workers Solomon Nyarende, Pretty Nkambule and Yvonne Mnisi were trapped underground as a result of the collapse.Their bodies remain underground due to financing difficulties and the danger involved in retrieving them.Labour at Vantage Goldfields Lily Gold Mine in Barberton have shamed mining bosses and the government for the snail s pace taken in retrieving the bodies of three trapped mine workers who were buried in a sinkhole at the mine, over a year ago.Association of Mine workers and Construction Union (Amcu) president Joseph Mathunjwa laid the logjam squarely on the doorstep of businesses and government.He slammed mining industry stakeholders for the laissez-faire attitude in bringing closure to the bereaved families, exactly 12 months since a container carrying the employees plunged 80m underground during a cave-in. It s a shame and a disgrace for the entire mining industry, for the Department of Minerals and Resources and the government in its entirety that one year after the Lily Mine disaster there is no closure for the families of Yvonne Mnisi, Pretty Nkambule and Solomon Nyarenda, their comrades and the community of Barberton, Mathunjwa said.-TNA Reporter
