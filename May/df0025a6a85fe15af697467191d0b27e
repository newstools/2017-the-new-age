Police made a major breakthrough in smashing a luxury car hijacking syndicate following the arrest of two suspects operating in Lenasia, south of Johannesburg.A 43-year-old male, Abinier Nhavonts and female, Siyyid Charloos, 33, briefly appeared in court yesterday. They were arrested after being found in possession of two illegal firearms and a police radio estimated to be worth R750000 on Sunday evening.Nine luxury vehicles ranging from an Audi RS7, Ford Ranger, MercedesBenz, Hyundai H1, Toyota Fortuner, a Hilux and a Porsche 911 were all recovered during their arrest. Member of the mayoral committee for safety, councillor Michael Sun in the city of Johannesburg, yesterday said that there were other syndicates targeting luxury vehicles in the city. This is a sophisticated criminal syndicate. This is not an isolated case, we have identified other areas where these syndicates are operating, he said.Sun said that they believed that the syndicates were selling these hijacked vehicles to neighbouring countries. More arrests will be made. Previous evidence suggests that buyers place an order with members of the syndicate for a specific vehicle, which is then identified and stolen, he said.Sun said that vehicles were being targeted in areas such as Fourways, parts of Soweto and London Road. The two are facing several charges ranging from possession of stolen vehicles and illegal firearms. The arrests came after law enforcement agencies including the police, Hawks and Tracker SA were given a tip-off about the syndicate.Gauteng police warned residents to be on the lookout for hijackers especially at robots, homes and in the CBD. Police spokesperson Kay Makhubela said: We always tell motorists to be on the lookout to avoid being hijacked especially in these areas. The duo briefly appeared in the Lenasia Magistrate s Court and their next court appearance is June 1. While Charloos was released on R100000 bail, Nhavonts remains behind bars.ZODIDI MHLANAzodidim@thenewage.co.za
