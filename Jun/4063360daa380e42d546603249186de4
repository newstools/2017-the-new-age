Algeria&#8217;s army said Sunday that it had killed three armed Islamists and captured several others in an ongoing operation in the country&#8217;s east.The joint operation by the army and other security forces in Constantine and Skikda, underway since June 11, has led to &#8220;the elimination of three terrorists, the capture of three others and eight people who were supporting criminal groups, and the surrender of another terrorist,&#8221; a defence ministry statement said.Weapons, ammunition and money were also recovered, the ministry said.More than 40 armed Islamists have been killed in Algerian army operations in the country&#8217;s mountainous east since the start of the year, according to official figures.Algerian authorities use the word &#8220;terrorist&#8221; to refer to armed Islamists active in the country since the start of the 1990s.Bloodshed blamed on such fighters, who took up arms against the state during a decade of brutal civil war from 1992, has lessened significantly, but such groups continue to clash regularly with security forces.-AFP
