Minister in the Presidency Susan Shabangu says violence against women has reached a crisis level and is calling on citizens to intervene and take charge of their own communities.&#8221; We need to fight this brutality&#8230;as mothers, as fathers this is hurting us. We must defend and protect our democracy and make sure that we protect our children,&#8221;&#8221; Government is ready but we also need you to help us in taking charge and fight this thing,&#8221; said Shabangu.The minister was speaking during the #Not In My Name which took place in Soweto, Johannesburg. The march was meant to raise awareness regarding the impact of gender based violence.The march which moved from the UJ Soweto campus to the Regina Mundi Church was also led by Gauteng MEC for Community safety, Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane.Shabangu challenged men to go out and mobilize other men to act against those that perpetrate violence against women.&#8221; all this starts somewhere charity begins at home. As parents we socialize our kids wrongly. What we see today are results of the way we treat our children. If we continue to say men are strong, we reap the rewards today,&#8221;&#8220;There is a new tendency of killing and burning. We have a problem but it starts with us as a community,&#8221; said Shabangu.A recent spike in violence directed at women has led to an outcry with organisations coming together to call for an end to the abuse.-TNA Reporter
