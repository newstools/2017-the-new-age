The Hawks have laid a charge of racism against one of its members after he called a colleague a K****r.The member, who has since resigned amid investigations, made the racist remarks in a text message to a WhatsApp group chat of SANEB.Hawks Spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Robert Netshiunda said it is not yet clear whether the remarks were referring to an individual or all the members of the group and that is subject to an investigation.Meanwhile Hawks head Lieutenant General Ntlemeza condemned the utterances saying: Hate Speech is a very serious case and this matter will be dealt with thoroughly so that the outcomes of the case must serve as a deterrent to those who ignore the sacrifices that freedom fighters had to make to attain a free and democratic South Africa.&#8221;Ntlemeza said such behaviour will not be tolerated. The Hawks is a transformed institution and we serve people of all races equally. We cannot have members within our ranks who are still living in pre-democracy South Africa, General Ntlemeza said.He has warned that anyone found to be using derogatory and racism-filled words which might in the end undermine one&#8217;s race, will face the full wrath of the law.The Hawks official in question has been in service for 29 years.-TNA Reporter
