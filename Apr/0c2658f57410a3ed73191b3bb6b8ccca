Although their tour started on a rocky note, Stormers coach Robbie Fleck has demanded that his side step up the intensity against the Highlanders tomorrow.The Stormers were beaten by the Crusaders last week in a match that saw them produce very little answers to their high intensity game, with Fleck later admitting that his side was not prepared for the New Zealand side s line speed. Another tough assignment awaits at the Forsyth-Barr Stadium in Dunedin, where the Cape Town side will face the 2015 Super Rugby champions who have not been in top form this season.Jamie Joseph s side have not looked as clinical as they were two seasons ago, posting five wins in eight matches, losing on three occasions. Players such as Aaron Smith, Ben Smith, Lima Sopoaga, Malakai Fekitoa and Waisake Naholo will be in the way of the Stormers coming out with a victory, but Fleck believes it s possible. He said his side will have to fix things that saw them produce a lacklustre performance against the Crusaders. We had a good discussion and we will take the lessons from the Crusaders game and move on. The key learning is that we haven t faced line speed like the Crusaders presented, where they really got off the line and put us under immense pressure, Fleck said. You need to be strong set-piece wise playing over here, but the key for us is to match the intensity and tempo that the Kiwi sides play at. The Highlanders are a team that like to move the ball around and play an attacking sort of game. They have a lot of All Blacks so they are a very dangerous side, especially when they are playing in Dunedin. We are going to keep pushing from our side and try to play with a high intensity, the Stormers coach said.Fleck will be encouraged by the return of captain Siya Kolisi, who was rested last week as part of the South African Rugby Union agreement with the franchises, while full back SP Marais will make the clash after recovering from injury.-Mmasekepe Matsebane|mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
