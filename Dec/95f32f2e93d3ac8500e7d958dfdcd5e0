The ANC Free State Provincial Executive Conference (PEC) has been declared unlawful and void, but delegates can still attend the 54th National Conference. The High Court also declared the Branch General Meetings (BGMs) of around 14 branches unlawful. The Free State ANC’s PEC and at least 14 branches in the province can’t attend the Conference. This is after the disgruntled members believed to be linked to former deputy provincial chairperson Thabo Manyoni took the party to court in a bid to declare the past weekends’ conference to be nullified and interdict all delegates from attending the 54 conference. The members said the province contravened a court order which halted the conference scheduled for the 1 December. The Bloemfontein High Court ordered that the PEC must re-run the 29 general branch meetings that elected delegates to the national conference. Meanwhile, last night the applicants advocate Dali Mpofu told the court that his clients want the BGMs to be rerun lawfully, not successfully as the respondents were arguing. Mpofu further said they want to disallow the bogus delegates, not simply delegates. “We want to disallow bogus delegates. Not simply delegates. The bogus ones. They should be excluded because they are the product of an unlawful meeting. As soon as we saw it was unlawful, we filed,” he said. At the same time, ANC national spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said the Free State court decision will not derail the conference. -Sipho Jack
