Recently we marked 41 years since the students uprising that took place in Soweto on June 16, 1976.The day is now as a celebrated national holiday rebranded as Youth Day, a day in which contributions of young people in the liberation project are evoked and celebrated. In fact, the whole month of June has become Youth Month.But, there are serious distortions and misrepresentations of historical facts in the dominant public narratives around the 1976 students uprising.One of most critical of these distortions is the persistent subtle projection of that uprising as the somewhat exclusive initiative of young men, to the complete exclusion and erasure of the invaluable contributions and sacrifices of the young women of that time.Very often, when June 16 is discussed or commemorated, the painful experiences, sacrifices and contributions of the young black women of the 1976 generation in the fight against white supremacist education are largely downplayed or completely erased.It is as though June 16 was the sole initiative of male students such as Tsietsi Mashinini and Khotso Seatlholo only (and of course, the first boy victim, Zolile Hector Pieterson) as though no black women were involved at all in planning meetings and the subsequent protest on that fateful day and weeks after.The names and identities of young women rarely appear even when victims of that June 16 massacre are evoked in public dialogues, intellectual discourse or media reports. These black women are continuously rendered invisible by the entire system; they simply don t exist, they are not regarded as worthy subjects of his-story For example, there are many female students who were shot and killed at various places around Chiawelo when the uprising began at Nghungunyane Secondary School, and whose identities remain a mystery to this day. Other examples are two specific women from Dlamini whose involvement in the June 16 uprising resulted in their lifetime confinement to wheelchairs.On June 17, 1976, a young girl, Hermina Leroke, was shot dead in Diepkloof after she and her peers had seen a helicopter and ran away.Her companions and friends witnessed her killing by the police.Her name, like many other young women who died, is unknown to most people.Even when pictures of the June 16 events are shown on public platforms, the selective gendering of the images used is quite apparent.In the media, in academia and in political spaces, the historic images used to tell the story are those of largely male students.Images of the June 16 uprising with young black women leading from the front, carrying placards with revolutionary messages alongside male students, defiant against military and police armoury, are rarely published or used.Consequently, the only stories that are told are those of the brave young men of that generation; those of the many brave, but nameless, young women doesn t appear to matter much in our national consciousness and memory of those tragic events.Take Sam Nzima s famous image of Mbuyisa Makhubu carrying Pieterson s dead body for example.In the same frame on that image is a clearly emotional Antoinette Sithole.But she bears little significance, she is afforded no historic currency at all, besides being known as the sister of the dead boy carried by Makhubu whose whereabouts are today unknown.She is cast either as an ahistorical o object in the enterprise of historical manufacture. Nothing is said about the fact that she was a young woman who had made a conscious decision, like many others, to protest on that day. We simply know her as Hector s sister .The subtle consensus constructed through this distorted approach to history is that June 16 was, firstly, conceived by men and led by men only; secondly, an exclusive initiative by students only; and thirdly, a one-day event which changed the course of history.Stories and experiences of less known people, particularly women, involved in June 16 are generally disregarded and undermined. Even Sibongile Mkhabela, the only woman who was an executive member of the Soweto Students Representative Council (SSRC) and general secretary of the South African Student Movement (SASM) that planned and organised the June 16 uprising, is hardly ever spoken of.Her contributions to and sacrifices for the liberation project are unknown to today s youth. And she is not an exception.Think of the silenced broader influences of women like Winnie Motlalepula Kgware who worked closely with the students as a teacher and had an influential role in the launch of the South African Students Organisation, later becoming the president of the Black People s Convention (BPC), an umbrella body of the Black Consciousness movement.Kgware s name, the first woman to be elected as president of a political organisation in South Africa, never appears on any public platforms in this country.There are many black women who were directly involved in the June 16 uprising, like Dikeledi Motswene who was a pupil at Ithute Senior Secondary in 1976, Priscilla Msesenyane a pupil at St Matthews Roman Catholic School, Naledi Kedi Motsau, a pupil at Naledi High School and Martha Matthews, at Kelekitso Senior Secondary, whose involvement isn t registered on our collective national memory.Other residents and black people of Soweto who were directly or indirectly involved and affected by the 1976 students uprising, like community activists, parents, officials, shop owners, nurses, doctors and teachers like Nozipho Joyce Mxakathi (now Diseko) also are missing completely from our memory when the story of the uprising is narrated.Another serious limitation of the way the memory of June 16 is reconstructed today is the lack of detail about the subsequent arrests, tortures and killings that occurred days and months after that initial day; right up to the trial of the Soweto 11 who were accused of sedition for organising the student protest in 1976.For days, weeks and months after June 16, the black community was under siege and terrorised by bloodthirsty police whose mandate was to capture or kill student leaders.In the book, Soweto 16 June 1976: Personal accounts of the Uprising, Martha Matthews, who took part in the June 16 protests, is quoted as saying: The following day it was worse because these boers were following people inside their yards. We could not go out.We could not go buy in shops. The boers cars were patrolling and they were driving very slow, very slow. I am telling you, if you want to die just get outside the house. They could even shoot a toddler as young as six years. Then there are stories of those that died on June 16; no one speaks for the dead as history is reconstructed and told.The contestations over the lifeless bodies of those killed that ensued between the state, their families and communities are muted and unknown.This approach to history also minimises the scale of the viciousness, violence and brutality of the racist apartheid regime.The extent to which, not only the students, but the entire black community and families were affected by the June 16 uprising becomes obscured and blurred.Stories of home invasions at night, police threats, beatings, sexual harassment, interrogations and torture of many women, mostly mothers, grandmothers and aunts of students, are mentioned in passing at least, or completely erased at worst.This obfuscates the stories and experiences of many ordinary black people, women especially, when the uprising took place.Thando SipuyeThando Sipuye is an Afrikan historian and a social scientist.
