DA leader Mmusi Maimane says it is &#8220;shocking&#8221; that the 14 companies involved in the upgrade of President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s Nkandla homestead continue to do business with government.The revelation emerged from a response to a DA written parliamentary question to Minister of Public Works, Nathi Nhleko which confirms that eight of the 14 companies contracted to carry out upgrades at Nkandla have since been rehired by the Department to perform other work.&#8220;The Minister also confirmed that not a single one of the 14 companies involved in these upgrades has been blacklisted, or placed on the restricted supplier database .&#8221; This is a shocking revelation considering the Constitutional Court found these upgrades to be fraught with corruption and unlawful enrichment, and once again proves that the more connected and corruptible you are, the more valuable to the ANC government you become, and the more illegitimate money you can make,&#8221; said Maimane.According to Maimane the DA will refer the matter to the Chief Procurement Officer at the National Treasury to conduct an assessment as to whether any of the companies involved has breached the Supply Change Management (SCM) policy and/or the National Treasury Regulations.&#8220;We are adamant that any company or individual who unduly benefited from carrying out work at Nkandla must be blacklisted and held accountable for their actions,&#8221; said Maimane.On Monday Public Works Minister Nkosinathi Nhleko cancelled a press briefing scheduled for Tuesday during which he was expected to set the record straight on further upgrades to President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s Nkandla homestead.On Sunday the Presidency denied that there would be further renovations at Nkandla.&#8220;There are no renovations of the private houses at the President&#8217;s residence at Nkandla currently and no government department has indicated any proposal for renovations,&#8221; said the PresidencyMeanwhile the disciplinary hearings of Department of public works officials accused of acting unlawfully during the Nkandla homestead upgrade are expected to continue on Tuesday.Last year National Treasury submitted a report to the Constitutional Court which determined that President Jacob Zuma pay R7 814 155 for the non-security upgrades at Nkandla.
