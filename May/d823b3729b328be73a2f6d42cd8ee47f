The ANC Youth League (ANCYL) in Limpopo have dismissed reports that Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma was invited by one faction in the province to address a cadres forum event.Dlamini Zuma was supposed to attend an event in Lebowakgomo Civic Centre through an invitation by the faction lobbying for her as the next president of the ANC, but according to the ANCYL, she failed to pitch up because of family bereavement.ANCYL provincial secretary Che Selane rubbished the statement by its Collins Chabane branch circulating on social media, saying that the branch on its own has no influence on the League s decisions. The ANC in Limpopo is for everyone, not for certain individuals, that s the reason why the Youth League executive in the province took a collective decision to invite comrade Dlamini Zuma, Selane said.With the event scheduled to start at 12pm, members of the ANCYL waited in anticipation for the former AU chairperson but they had to be addressed by Minister of Transport Joseph Maswanganyi and Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Maite NkoanaMashabane.Selane said the Youth League was planning another event in the province as they prepare for a provincial conference and Dlamini Zuma would receive another invitation.AKANI MANGENAnews@thenewage.co.za
