With the passing of esteemed elder statesman Ahmed Mohamed Kathrada, it is fitting to consider the passing of the torch of leadership in South Africa.On March 27, the South African Institute of International Affairs (SAIIA) hosted a forum on Africa s Role in Governing Global Risks: Emerging Voices from the Continent.The five-member panel included speakers from several Africa nations. They offered diverse perspectives on the emerging voices the too often unheard or discounted voices of the youth.Most African countries define youth as those between ages 18 and 35 (South Africa 15-35). In most African countries the median age is below 20. Most of Africa s leaders are beyond 60 some well beyond.The continent s youth have too often been galvanised or intimidated them into action often violently by political elites, to defeat rivals or protect entrenched positions. They are deemed easy targets of radicalisation.Campaigns address youth as beneficiaries of assistance. Yet policies and programmes have been largely ineffective in addressing either the causes or consequences of the poverty, disproportional unemployment, and lack of training and education affecting many of Africa s youth.Panellists represented both sides of the official youth divide, but all agreed that African governments are not involving young adults in meaningful decision making and policy framing or in the implementation of programmes that affect their lives.SAIIA s event was co-hosted by the Global Challenges Foundation (GCF) to provide a forum for re-envisioning global governance.The aim of GCF is to incite deeper understanding of the most pressing global risks to humanity, including climate change, conflict, extreme poverty and population growth.Such risks transcend national borders. They require global solutions and new forms of international cooperation to tackle them.Existing international forums are not up to the task.GCF has issued a worldwide challenge for alternatives which would complement, strengthen or revise the present UN system, or to propose new forms of governance guided by human rights principles and capable of effective, timely and equitable interventions.Along with other panellists, Deon Shekuza, a Namibian youth activist leading a Southern Africa youth climate change coalition for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process, emphasised the need for transgressive, transformational development to tackle global risks and to implement radical and sustainable change in society.Transgressive thinking crosses academic boundaries and technical disciplines. Transformational development ensures that recommendations for policies and programmes are understood by those who implement them.With issues such as climate change, the problem is not policies, which are on the shelves, according to Wanjira Mathai, director for the Partnership on Women s Entrepreneurship in Renewables (wPOWER) Hub at the Wangari Maathai Institute in Kenya. It is in practical and local implementations where things fall apart.If politicians don t understand the science behind the suggested solution, policy decisions prove ineffective or even counterproductive.When data-driven decision making ignores the values and preferences of those who must apply the changes, success is unlikely.Adoption of clean energy practices in rural Kenya is low because 80% of women simply prefer cooking on wood.Vivian Adhiambo Onano, vice-chair of the Global Youth Empowerment Fund Board of Trustees, detailed some of the obstacles to youth participation.Young people often don t know how to open the right doors.They have difficulty getting access to decision makers or having their ideas respected and included in policy making. Skills must be acquired to submit proposals for funding.Luanda Mpungose, programme officer for the governance and foreign policy programme at SAIIA, said young people need platforms where discussions are discussed so that the government does get exposed to youth ideas and concerns. The government must be held accountable for engaging.Prof Coleen Vogel, based at the Global Change and Sustainability Research Institute (GCSRI) at Wits University, suggested fresh thinking was needed on how we generate and disseminate knowledge.She cautioned the young people in the audience to understand that activism is a lot of hard work. Nobody s going to hand it to you. They needed to think creatively about how to co-op space and engage elders. They had to be prepared to see things through.John Stremlau, visiting professor in International Relations as Wits, suggested from the floor that young people write implementable research papers, work cross-culturally and get sponsors for groups of youth actors from across the continent.Panellists offered ideas that would help young adults tackle national and global issues.Suggestions included intergenerational mentorship and dialogues to share examples of successes and failures, approaching problems within the African perspective and bringing the humanities and social sciences into discussion with scientists.The youth of today are already dynamic actors in the world.They are the generation that will be held accountable for dealing with Africa s challenges and for Africa s role in addressing global catastrophic risks.Whether anyone is paying attention or not, the torch is already changing hands.Tom WheelerTom Wheeler is an independent commentator and former diplomat
