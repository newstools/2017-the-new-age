Barcelona have dazzled at times in La Liga yet they head into Saturday&#8217;s home game against Las Palmas in third position.Inconsistency has left Luis Enrique&#8217;s team five points adrift of Real Madrid, who have a game in hand and face second-place Sevilla for the third time in 11 days in their La Liga game on Sunday.Luis Enrique believes his players can start to move up a gear after sparkling while overturning a 2-1 deficit in their King&#8217;s Cup tie with Athletic Bilbao to progress to the quarter-finals, 4-3 on aggregate.&#8220;In recent games, teams have been doing very little but scoring against us,&#8221; Luis Enrique told his club&#8217;s website. &#8220;But with my players&#8217; attitude, I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll put that behind us quickly. What we have to do now is string some wins together.&#8221;Against Athletic, Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar scored in the same game for the first time since a 4-0 romp over Manchester City on Oct. 19.Neymar&#8217;s goal was his first for Barca since that game.Suarez&#8217;s strike was his 100th goal for the club in 120 appearances and it marked the 300th for Barca&#8217;s attacking trio since they began to play together.&#8220;This result will do a lot to lift our morale,&#8221; Suarez said. &#8220;It&#8217;s what we wanted and it&#8217;s what we needed. Now we need to keep working hard to meet our targets.&#8221;Eighth-place Las Palmas beat Atletico Madrid, 3-2, in the King&#8217;s Cup but lost 4-3 on aggregate.Real will travel to the Sanchez Pizjuan after facing Sevilla at the same venue on Thursday in the King&#8217;s Cup last 16.
