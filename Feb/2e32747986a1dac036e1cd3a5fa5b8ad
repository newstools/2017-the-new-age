Royal Bafokeng Platinum (RBP) is anticipating earnings per share for the full year to be 105% higher than the prior period, the company said yesterday in a trading update.Earnings per share (EPS) will be between 81c and 92c for the year ended December while headline earnings per share (HEPS) have increased by between 196.2% and 209.4% to between 80c and 91c. The expected increase on EPS and HEPS in 2016 is largely attributed to the net effect of a 9.8% increase in revenue, mainly as a result of a higher realised revenue basket price, combined with a nominal 0.6% increase in cost of sales. The improved earnings combined with a strong cash flow contribution from on-reef development revenue at the Styldrift I project resulted in the group having a substantial cash balance at the end of the year. Cash preservation continues to be a priority, the company said. RBP expects to release its full year results on February 28. THELMA NGOMA| thelman@thenewage.co.za
