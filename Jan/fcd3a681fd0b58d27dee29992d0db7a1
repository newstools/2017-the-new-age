The city of Cape Town has threatened a blanket ban on the watering of gardens unless residents reduce their water usage even further.While average consumption has dropped over the past two weeks, it is still 29 million litres above the desired level. Dam levels are now standing at only 46%, while water usage is exceeding 800 million litres a day. We know that there are still a number of dry months ahead, so unless residents reduce their water use to meet the target, even more stringent restrictions are likely in the near future, city spokesperson Priya Reddy said.The Department of Water and Sanitation said there needs to be a national average of more than 70% for South Africans to be supplied with water throughout the coming winter.The department said although dam levels had improved considerably, the levels were not at a satisfactory level . If we look at the national average, we d have loved to be above 70% towards the 80-85% level to be able to be comfortably through the next winter season, department spokesperson Sputnik Ratau said.Meanwhile, water expert Paul Fairell said January and February were the last months where there was some hope of heavy rainfall in the country. We ve got January and February left, so even if we re going to have fantastic rains, we re still going to struggle to get them up to the levels they normally run at this time of the year, Fairell said.With implemented water restrictions, the aim was for residents to keep water consumption at winter levels, which equated to 800 million litres or less per day in the city metropolitan area. This would ensure Cape Town s water supply would last until winter.City of Cape Town mayoral committee member for utility services Ernest Sonnenberg said there was a slight improvement in residential water usage but warned that consumption was still not at the desired level. The city appeals to residents to be mindful of water usage and we d like to remind them to abide by the restrictions, Sonnenberg said.Tatenda Chiriseri
