Popular Conan O&#8217;Brien talkshow segment &#8220;Clueless Gamer,&#8221; in which he and, at times, one or more celebrities, play through and relate their impressions of a big new video game, is to get its own series &#8212; but there&#8217;s a twist.Conan O&#8217;Brien, something of a pioneer in the online space, started 2012 segment &#8220;Clueless Gamer&#8221; as a web exclusive and was valuable enough to become part of the regular TBS talk show &#8220;Conan.&#8221;Popular episodes have featured Conan quipping to marquee releases &#8220;Grand Theft Auto V,&#8221; &#8220;Super Smash Bros.&#8221; and &#8220;The Witcher 3&#8221; alongside show producer Aaron Bleyaert, while special guests have also been involved: Peter Dinklage and Lena Headey of &#8220;Game of Thrones&#8221; played &#8220;Overwatch,&#8221; while NFL players and Super Bowl finalists Marshawn Lynch and Rob Gronkowski grappled through &#8220;Mortal Kombat X.&#8221;The twist for the proposed &#8220;Clueless Gamer&#8221; standalone is that although O&#8217;Brien remains on board as an executive producer, The Hollywood Reporter notes that he will not present the show. Instead, a different host will be announced as development on the project continues.As &#8220;Clueless Gamer&#8221; goes into production in February, it joins a number of other talk show spin-offs such as Jimmy Fallon&#8217;s &#8220;Lip Sync Battle,&#8221; Jimmy Kimmel&#8217;s &#8220;Who Knows?&#8221; (&#8220;Big Fan&#8221; as a series,) and James Corden&#8217;s &#8220;Carpool Karaoke&#8221; which is heading to Apple TV.-Relaxnews
