After Batman and Superman, actor Morgan Freeman is the latest brand ambassador for Turkish Airlines.Freeman, a licensed pilot himself, lends his deep, baritone voice to the commercial which pitches Turkish Airlines as the bridge between worlds for those who still regard the world with a sense of wonder, and those who find &#8220;delight in our differences.&#8221;Turkish Airlines flies to more countries than any other airline in the world. The commercial was filmed in Los Angeles over a period of 10 hours with a crew of 101 people.Last year, the carrier tapped Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill and Jesse Eisenberg from &#8220;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&#8221; to appear in a promotional ad as part of a sponsorship deal with the film.Turkish Airlines has snagged the title of &#8220;Best Airline in Europe&#8221; by the airline passenger survey organization Skytrax, for the last six years in a row.-Relaxnews
