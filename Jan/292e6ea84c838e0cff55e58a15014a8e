After living under the shadow of Roxanne Barker for a long time, Andile Dlamini has been afforded another chance to cement her place as Banyana Banyana s first-choice goalkeeper.Barker and Nompumelelo Nyandeni are the two players who will miss South Africa s international friendly against France due to injuries.The sides will meet in SaintDenis, Reunion, on Sunday.Barker is still nursing a toe injury that saw her pull out of the 2016 Africa Women s Cup of Nations in Cameroon while Nyandeni has not recovered from her knee injury.In Barker s absence, Dlamini has stepped up and done well for Banyana, helping the team to thesemifinals in Cameroon.Before the Africa Women s Cup of Nations, Dlamini had struggled for game time as Barker made the No 1 jersey her own.This will be another chance for Dlamini to prove to interim coach Desiree Ellis that she deserves to be Banyana s first choice.Yolula Tsawe is another goalkeeper in the squad who will hope for a chance to prove that she has what it takes to be a regular Banyana shot stopper.Ellis plans to call up two players to replace the injured duo before they travel to France on Thursday. Roxanne has recovered from her toe injury but is not yet fit to play in a match and her club has advised that she doesn t travel for the match against France, Ellis said. Together with the technical team we are working on the names to replace the two players who have withdrawn. Mpumi picked up an injury a few days ago after training before we reported for the national team camp.She felt a pain in the knee and came in to have an assessment but unfortunately it doesn t look good for her to be part of the squad. She will, however, be training with us so we can help with her rehabilitation, adding on what she will be doing on her own at home. Banyana assembled for camp on Friday and held their first training session on Saturday and Ellis was impressed with the fitness levels of players considering they just came back from holiday. They were really enjoying themselves and didn t want to stop, Ellis said. The aim on the first day was to get the muscles going and just to give them a bit of a run and they looked good. The focus was mainly on finishing and it looked very encouraging. SITHEMBISO DINDIsithembisod@thenewage.co.za
