Zimbabwe&#8217;s Constitutional Court dismissed a case against President Robert Mugabe on Wednesday lodged by an activist who accused the ageing leader of violating the southern African country&#8217;s supreme law during protests last year.The case was the first time a private citizen has asked the court to decide whether actions by 92-year-old Mugabe, the world&#8217;s oldest leader, violated the constitution.Mugabe, who has ruled the former British colony since independence in 1980, was last year confronted by the biggest anti-government protests in a decade. Security forces responded with teargas and water cannon.Political activist Promise Mkwananzi, whose #Tajamuka group helped organise the demonstrations, said in his application that Mugabe&#8217;s response and speeches in the protests&#8217; aftermath &#8220;undermined national security and threatened citizens.&#8221;At a meeting with war veterans after one of the protests, Mugabe said his ruling ZANU-PF punished defectors during the liberation war by keeping them &#8220;underground like rats, in bunkers&#8221; &#8211; something he threatened to do to protest leaders.Mkwananzi said Mugabe also claimed partisan control of the police and army, which is against the constitution.But the nine-member Constitutional Court bench dismissed the case, saying Mkwananzi did not follow proper procedure in making his application. His lawyer consented to the decision.&#8220;We are going to re-apply within 30 days in terms of the constitution, correcting those technicalities. We are not giving up,&#8221; Mkwananzi told reporters after the 20-minute hearing.Attorney General Prince Machaya, who was representing the government, made no comment to the court other than to say the case should be dismissed.Under Zimbabwe&#8217;s laws, if the top court finds that a sitting president has violated the constitution, it can order parliament to start an investigation that could lead to impeachment.Mugabe has been endorsed as ZANU-PF&#8217;s candidate for presidential elections due in 2018.Separately, the High Court granted bail to activist pastor Evan Mawarire, who has been charged with organising last year&#8217;s protests and inciting violence. Mawarire was arrested last week on his return from the United States.-Reuters
