Andile Mngxitama has accused organisers of tomorrows #NationalDayOfAction march of selective protesting which he says deliberately ignores corruption by the white corporate sector.The national convener of the Black First Land First (BLF) activist group was a panel member speaking during a breakfast seminar hosted by the South African Association of Public Administration and Management (SAAPAM) under the theme Is the post-apartheid state unraveling? &#8220;Now Vavi and them say the Gupta&#8217;s must go. They don&#8217;t say Lonmin must go. They accept that the Gupta&#8217;s accounts must be closed but they don&#8217;t say Lonmin accounts should be shut down.&#8220;They don&#8217;t say that ABSA and Uniliver must pay back the money, which is owned by Johan Rupert and we know through the competition commission has stolen money from the poor, there are no marches against them,&#8221; said Mngxitama.According to Mngxitama Wednesday&#8217;s march which is being spearheaded by a coalition of opposition parties including the ACDP, Cope, DA, EFF, IFP, UDM and APC is being bankrolled by white capital to help oust President Jacob Zuma.&#8220;Now we are being called to march because President Zuma has finally decided to join the call for change and they want him out in the same way they have bribed politicians in Brazil.&#8220;Theses marches have been organised and well funded.There is a whole page advert in the Sunday Times for tomorrows march. White Capital is organising the marches because they want Zuma to go,&#8221; said MngxitamaHowever Mngxitama&#8217;s comments were dismissed by trade unionist Zwelinzima Vavi who said President Zuma no longer had the interest of South Africans as a whole at heart.&#8220;The contract that existed between the ANC and the people of South Africa has unraveled. The crisis facing black workers in the main has simply gone worse. Unemployment has increased and we have become the most unequal society.&#8220;More people live under the poverty line. That&#8217;s what we call unraveling. There is a political crisis and a crisis of capitalism and Zuma himself reflects crony capitalism,&#8221; said Vavi.Professor Mcebisi Ndletyana echoed Vavi&#8217;s sentiments saying Zuma no longer had legitimacy as a leader.&#8220;Certainly there is a crisis of leadership. Zuma became a client of the Guptas that is what we know factually according to the public protectors report. The president has a crisis of credibility. So then how does he build legitimacy for himself? &#8220;.Mngxitama however rubbished the public protectors report saying &#8220;Only illiterate people will read the public protector report&#8221;.&#8220;Thuli Madonsela refuses to investigate white monopoly capital and the money which they stole. Those who protect white capital always speak with two fork tongues,&#8221; said Mngxitama.-TNA Reporter
