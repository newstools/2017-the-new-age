Tokyo shares eased Friday morning after three days of gains, but Nintendo jumped as the videogame giant launched its newest console.A rally in the dollar against the yen Thursday boosted exporters and led to an initial advance but they soon reversed course as investors locked in profits.Tokyo&#8217;s benchmark Nikkei 225 slipped 0.14 percent, or 27.22 points, to 19,537.58 by the break, while the Topix index of all first-section issues was down 0.18 percent, or 2.77 points, at 1,561.92.&#8221;Local equities may pull back following recent sharp gains, said Shunichi Otsuka, general manager of research and strategy at Ichiyoshi Securities in Tokyo.&#8220;But with the odds of a US rate hike growing, the foreign-exchange rate is likely to maintain the current 114 yen-for-dollar range, which means corporate earnings will be even better for this fiscal year and also look good in the new year,&#8221; Otsuka told Bloomberg News.On Friday, the dollar was at 114.25 yen, slightly weaker than 114.39 yen late in New York but still better than the sub-112 yen levels seen earlier this week.Nintendo jumped 3.40 percent to 23,655 yen as its new console went on sale with gamers queueing up outside stores around the country.Rival games console maker Sony rose 1.06 percent to 3,621 yen and market heavyweight Fast Retailing, operator of the Uniqlo chain, tacked on 2.46 percent to end the morning at 37,400 yen.Toyota slipped 0.37 percent to 6,446 yen and SoftBank was down 0.74 percent at 8,515 yen.-AFP
