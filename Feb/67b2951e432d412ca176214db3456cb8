&nbsp;If it was up to Tsepo Masilela, he would retire at Kaizer Chiefs. The 31-year-old defender has no intention of leaving the club for any PSL team but could be on his way out of the club as his contract expires at the end of June and could leave for free if the club decides not to renew it. Masilela wants to stay at the club as they have been good to him but that it will only depend on negotiations over a new contract. They have been good to me to be honest since I came back. But as a footballer it s tough to predict your future, sometimes is not up to you, Masilela said. You can only wish and want. If it means I retire at Chiefs so be it. I don t have a problem with them, they have been really good to me. Perhaps the fact that Masilela has seen limited game time this season is the reason there is a delay in negotiations for a new contract. Sibusiso Khumalo has kept him out of the starting XI as he has made the left back position his own and Masilela said that he supports any decision the coach takes. It s competition and it is the coach s decision. I m available if the coach needs me to play. If he decides to play Sbu, I will support him or whoever is playing. When we win everyone is happy, the fans are happy, we put that first. If Sbu is playing well and the coach feels he must start I m okay with whatever. We are okay, we do talk time and again. We encourage one another, obviously when he plays I want him to do well and also at training there is good healthy competition. With Amakhosi having recorded four successive victories, the ex-Maccabi Haifa defender feels they have turned the corner and are on track to win the league title. In terms of the team, I think we are on the right track. We closed strongly and we had two good wins after the break and we are still there in the top five. Anything is possible, there are many games to play and we are hoping that we will finish top and win the league. Neville Khoza| nevillek@thenewage.co.za
