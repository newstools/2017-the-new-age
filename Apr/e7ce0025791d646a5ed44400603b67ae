Hlaudi Motsoeneng has dismissed reports that the 90% local content policy is to be blamed for loss of revenue at the public broadcaster.During a wide ranging press conference on Wednesday the former SABC Chief Operations Officer questioned reports that listenership had dropped since the implementation of the policy.&#8221; Those who say the audience is decreasing because of more local content, I want know, by how much? &#8221;&#8221; When I checked, the difference in listenership was between 1-2%. How can you cry about 1-2%. The decreases can&#8217;t be because of the 90% rule, it might be because of the format and quality of the music being played.&#8221; said Motsoeneng.Earlier this month a group of musicians expressed concerns that the new interim board at the SABC would do away with the 90% local music policy that came into effect during Motsoeneng s tenure at the broadcaster.The new interim board was lambasted by a number of speakers before Motsoeneng himself took to the podium on Wednesday.The former COO steered clear of speaking ill of the new interim board however he accused interim board member Krish Naidoo of lying under oath.&#8221; From the portfolio committee report if the whole board was a mess, why is Krish Naidoo on the interim board? Krish Naidoo lied under oath and all those who lied under oath should be investigated&#8221;&#8221; According to me Krish Naidoo should not be a part of the SABC board because he&#8217;s not credible.&#8221; said Motsoeneng.Hlaudi further questioned Naidoo&#8217;s credibility saying he had a conflict of interest because he was an employee of the ANC based at the paty&#8217;s headquarters Luthuli House.Last year Naidoo alongside Vusi Mavuso resigned while attending a meeting of Parliament s communications committee meeting in October.He also testified to Parliament s Ad-Hoc committee that Communications Minister Faith Muthambi had influenced the appointment of Motsoeneng as Chief Operations Officer.Meanwhile Motsoeneng said he was looking forward to attending disciplinary proceedings against him saying they would finally clear his name.&#8221; Disciplinary hearing will give me a chance to present my side of the story. I&#8217;m going to be there to respond to all those allegations made against me &#8221;However Motsoeneng confirmed that he was not part of the review of the public protectors report saying that was an SABC matter.Meanwhile Motsoeneng also said the parliamentary inquiry into to the fitness of the then board to hold office was marred by political agenda&#8217;s.&#8221; I wasn&#8217;t invited by the Ad hoc committee. I accompanied the former board Chair so when they walked out, I followed them. I was never invited and I was suprised that the Ad hoc committee did not call me.&#8221;Motsoeneng said his legal team had advised him to only avail himself to the committee only once he was invited to take part in proceedings.&#8221; There Is nothing wrong with what we did during my time at the SABC. We did what South Africans want &#8220;said Motsoeneng.-TNA Reporter
