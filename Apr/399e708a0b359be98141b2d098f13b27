The Social Justice Coalition (SJC) is set to protest against the building of a police station in Muizenburg Cape Town accusing SAPS of prioritising white communities and the safety of white people.SJC says the planned construction of the new police station, which will reportedly cost R100 million, is an insult to crime ridden black communities in the Western Cape.&#8220;Resources are going to be allocated to a white suburb that does not need a police station. In Muizenburg there is currently a police station, &#8221;&#8220;Just next to Muizenburg there is a black community which does not have a police station. You have to walk up to 12km to get to the Muizenburg police station,&#8221; said SJC&#8217;s head of safety and justice programme, Chumile Sali.&#8220;There is also the community of Masiphumelele which has been campaigning for a police station in their community,&#8221;&#8220;So instead of building police stations in these communities SAPS continues to prioratise white communities and the safety of white people. These white communities have less crime compared to black communities,&#8221; he said.According to Sali in 2005 SAPS committed to build a police station in the community of Nyana which he calls &#8220;the murder capital of South Africa&#8221;.&#8220;But till today that police station has not been built.&#8221;According to statistics in 2014 Nyanga had 305 recorded murders, dropping slightly in 2015 to 300 murders and last year 279 murders were reported.SJC says they will on Tuesday march to the SAPS provincial office located in Green Point, where they will deliver a memorandum calling for just allocation of police resources in Black Communities.SJC will march alongside the Nyanga Community Policing Forum and Equal Education organisation and approximately 80 protestors are expected to take part in the march.Attempts to speak to the Muizenberg police were unsuccessful as the media liaison officer is currently on leave.-TNA Reporter
