EFF leader Julius Malema suggests that ANC Deputy President Congress Cyril Ramaphosa will win the ANC’s Presidential elections. Malema made the predictions on Twitter ahead of the ANC National Conference to be held from 16 to 20 December in Johannesburg, Nasrec. “For those asking for my predictions, I think he will win. I don’t think she stands a good chance despite her good struggle credentials, she is currently surrounded and supported by crooks. “All leaders claiming to support her lost their branches, how do you explain that one,” he said. The EFF leader who once led the ANC as its Youth league President further went on to discredit the supporters of the only female candidate in the presidential race.  Referring only to the candidate as ‘she’ Malema gave suggestions that he is referring to Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma as she is the only female contesting for the presidency.  “Her supporters are extremely dishonest to a point of believing their own propaganda, they lied about branch nominations until they were officially announced then they changed the ball post,” he said. Malema also accuses her supporters of not being truthful.  “The new narrative now is that we have more delegates but they know very well it’s a lie.”  -TNA Reporter
