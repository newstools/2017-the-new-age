The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) is conducting an investigation after two women reportedly died from malaria in Doornpoort, Pretoria.The NICD said neither person had travelled to a known malaria transmission area. A team comprising members from the vector control reference laboratory at NICD, district health services environmental health and the communicable disease control programme is conducting investigations in the area, NICD spokesperson Nombuso Shabalala said.Cheryl Pieterse died on Thursday and Jolynn Riekert Hocanin died on Sunday. The Gauteng department of health said it was investigating the reported malaria cases.The 58-year-old Pieterse died in Steve Biko Academic Hospital after becoming ill with flu-like symptoms the previous week.Pieterse leaves behind two children and a grandson. Her memorial service will take place on Thursday at 11am at the Queenswood Catholic Church. She said it is likely the patients acquired malaria from the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito inadvertently translocated from a malaria endemic area by a vehicle such as a minibus, car, suitcase or an aeroplane the area is close to an airport rather than from local transmission. These incidents are rare, but a few cases of Odyssean malaria are confirmed each year and coincide with the seasonal increase in malaria cases from January to April. These cases do not represent an expansion in the malaria transmission areas in South Africa, Shabalala said.Malaria treatment is very effective if administered early in the course of the illness.Unfortunately these cases are often diagnosed late due to the non-specific signs and symptoms of malaria and the absence of a travel history to a known malaria transmission area which is key to suspecting malaria as the cause of fever. Malaria kills more than 400 000 people each year, mostly children in Africa who do not receive adequate treatment.Malaria is not commonly found in South Africa but cases have been reported when immigrants and travellers return from countries where malaria is more common.She said although there were heavy rains on the Highveld, which results in an increase in culicine mosquito populations, these mosquitoes never transmit malaria.Malaria must be urgently considered in any resident or traveller from a known malaria transmission areas with acute onset of fever or flu-like illnesses such as fever, headache, muscle pains, chills and sweats. Urgent blood tests must be done and repeated if negative.Malaria treatment is very effective if administered early in the course of the illness. Travellers to known malaria transmission areas during the next two months must take precautions to reduce mosquito bites and may consider malaria preventive medication for high risk areas, she said.NONDUMISO ZWANEnondumisoz@thenewage.co.za
