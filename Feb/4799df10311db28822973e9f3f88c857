BP returned to profit in 2016 as cost-cutting and lower charges linked to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill offset weaker crude prices, the British energy giant announced Tuesday.Profit after tax stood at $115 million (108 million euros) compared with a net loss of $6.5 billion in 2015, BP said in an earnings statement.BP took another huge charge linked to its role in the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill &#8212; but at $4.0 billion it was lower than in 2015.The latest charge brought the overall cost to BP to around $63 billion, or $44 billion after tax.&#8220;We have delivered solid results in tough conditions and are well prepared for any volatility in oil pricing,&#8221; BP chief executive Bob Dudley said in the statement.&#8221;We have adapted by cutting our controllable cash costs by $7 billion from 2014, a full year earlier than planned.&#8220;Continued tight discipline on costs remains essential. Everything we have done during the year has made us a more resilient and competitive company,&#8221; he added.In 2015, BP posted the company&#8217;s biggest loss in at least 20 years, ravaged by Gulf of Mexico spill costs and tumbling oil prices &#8212; which caused the group to axe jobs and cut investments.In 2010, a deadly explosion on a BP-leased drilling rig, the Deepwater Horizon, unleashed the worst environmental disaster in US history.&#8221;With our Deepwater Horizon financial liabilities now substantially behind us, BP is fully focused on the future,&#8221; Dudley added Tuesday after a year in which BP was hit hard also by weak oil prices despite a market recovery in the fourth quarter.BP noted that average Brent North Sea crude prices stood at $44 a barrel in 2016, the lowest for 12 years.Crude prices have however rebounded sharply in recent months, with Brent back above $55 thanks to a deal by OPEC and non-cartel members to limit output.Prior to the recovery, crude markets slumped over a period of around two years on a global supply glut, hitting 13-year lows under $30 a barrel at the start of 2016.In morning deals following the update, BP&#8217;s share price dropped 2.4 percent to 464.80 pence on London&#8217;s benchmark FTSE 100 index, which was up 0.4 percent overall.&#8220;BP needs oil to fetch $60 a barrel this year to effectively break even, and with Brent currently trading at around $56, it is still dependent on fair winds from the commodity markets to push it along,&#8221; Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown stockbrokers, said in reaction to Tuesday&#8217;s results update.BP rival Royal Dutch Shell last week said its profit after tax more than doubled to around $4.6 billion in 2016, helped by recovering oil prices in the fourth quarter.-AFP &nbsp;
