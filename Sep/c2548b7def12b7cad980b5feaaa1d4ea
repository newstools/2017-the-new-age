Cancers affecting children are some of the medical mysteries of our times. They are mysteries because their causes are unknown and their cure is elusive, said Free State Provincial Spokesperson Mondli Mvambi.Mvambi said this as the department gears to launch the early childhood cancer awareness on Friday.&#8220;Department of Health has earmarked September as the month in which awareness can be upscale on various types of cancers and how to detect them early in order to initiate any level of care that may be appropriate to it,&#8221; said Mvambi.He further said during the walk around at the Paediatric Ward at Universitas Academic Hospital the Matron in charge explained that the Childhood ailments that the Ward is dealing with are too demanding and require a focused team of professionals.&#8220;There are shortages of staff in comparison to work demands but stated in appreciation the level of commitment that is shown by the current levels of nursing staff. The Nursing staff complement is at 60% in comparison to the ideal wishes of 80%. The ward is attended to by highly Specialised Medical Officers,&#8221; the Matron explained.She further told officials that the Nursing staff are responsible for taking care of the needs of the children.Mvambi added that the Paediatric Ward of Universitas Hospital works like hand in glove with CHOC reason being that patients that end up being cared for and lodging at CHOC house are patients of Universitas Academic Hospital.&#8220;In 2016, there were 900 new diagnoses of Childhood Cancers in South Africa. A whopping 10% which is 90 patients of these was housed at Universitas Academic Hospital and they end up being housed at CHOC house for lodging when they visit the hospital for follow up hospital visits,&#8221; he said.-TNA Reporter&nbsp;&nbsp;
