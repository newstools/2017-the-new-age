Belgian coach Luc Eymael was yesterday set to appeal the PSL s dispute resolution chamber s (DRC) ruling that said he must return to his former club, Polokwane City.Eymael left City in March to join Bloemfontein Celtic. This did not go down well with City and they eventually lodged a complaint with the league s DRC. On Tuesday the body ruled in Polokwane s favour, ordering Eymael to pack his bags and head back to Limpopo.However, the coach afterwards said he would appeal the decision. I am saddened by the latest turn of events. I will fight this to the end. I don t know what my sin is. Other coaches have resigned but there was no noise made. Why me? I have two kids to look after and this whole thing is unbearable for me. As a result of the standoff, Eymael has not been able to sit on the bench at Celtic, sending instructions to co-coaches Lehlohonolo Seema and John Maduka through text messages from the stands. This is not the first time that the PSL DRC has ruled that a coach return to a former club. But a high court ruling cleared the way for Gordon Igesund to quit Santos ahead of the expiry of his contract to link up with Ajax Cape Town in 2002.In another dispute, the matter between defender Siboniso Gaxa and former employers Kaizer Chiefs is headed for arbitration with Safa. The former Bafana Bafana defender, now with Bidvest Wits, was dealt a blow when the PSL s DRC ruled in favour of Chiefs after he challenged his dismissal from the club six months earlier. Gaxa s agent Glynn Binkin confirmed the latest developments.-Linda Ximba|news@thenewage.co.za
