With the National First Division expected to intensify in its second round, some clubs have begun to ring changes in their technical benches and on the playing front.East London side Mthatha Bucks are set to rope in Ian Palmer to replace Velile Dyaloyi who was relieved of his duties last week, owing to poor results.Dyaloyi, who worked briefly at Chippa United, helped Bucks survive the axe last season after arriving in November. As the club went into the Christmas break seventh on the log with 21 points from 15 matches, the management felt they needed someone with fresh ideas to lead the team s promotional play-offs.Palmer, a former Maritzburg United coach, is tipped to take over, with ex-University of Pretoria and Polokwane City assistant Sly Mosale also linked with a move to the East London side.In Durban, AmaZulu who finished strongly last year with four wins, have released ex-Golden Arrows and Polokwane City striker Siphelele Nzimande.It is believed Nzimande was axed to make way for former Black Leopards and Polokwane frontman Roggert Yundu.Usuthu have also bolstered their defence with the acquisition of Caps United defender Stephen Makatuka.In the Mother City, Cape Town All Stars are backing Greg Itafia to hold the fort and appoint an assistant of his choice.The former Moroka Swallows goalkeeper has been acting as caretaker since Igugu leKapa parted ways with Professor Ngubane and later Patrick Mabedi.The NFD second round resumes in February after the Afcon tournament starting in Gabon from Saturday.Linda Ximba
