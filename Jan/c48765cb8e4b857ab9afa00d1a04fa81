TEFU Mashamaite is set to finally make his debut for SuperSport United when they resume their league matches next month. The defender s return to the PSL was delayed by knee surgery shortly after joining the club in August after a spell in Sweden.He had struggled with the injury while at BK Hacken and returned home to join SuperSport carrying that injury. The 32 year old has now fully recovered and played 90 minutes for SuperSport in their Mbombela Cup challenge success against Bidvest Wits at the weekend. He now looks set to make his official debut although any fitness issue could lead to another delay. He could turn out for the SuperSport MultiChoice Diski Challenge team in a bid to get his match fitness back up before being considered for first team duties. He played against Wits at the weekend and didn t complain about any pain after that. This means that he is ready to play a PSL official match, SuperSport spokesperson David Skhosana said. This will come as an extra boost for Stuart Baxter s charges who already enjoy one of the best defensive records in the league.The log leaders have only conceded eight goals in 14 matches this season and the return of Mashamaite is expected to stabilise their defence even more. The Tshwane side, who have lost just once in the league this season, will resume against Golden Arrows at home on February 8 before facing Free State Stars six days later. Having ended the year on a high note, they will also be looking to continue where they left off following with back-to-back victories to maintain their prime position on the log. The league will resume on February 3 with Orlando Pirates making a short trip to face Bidvest Wits at Ellis Park. Kaizer Chiefs will face Free State Stars on February 7, while African champions Mamelodi Sundowns will play Bloemfontein Celtic away a day later.nevillek@thenewage.co.za-Neville Khoza
