The Citizen newspaper editor Steven Motale, yesterday said he is challenging his suspension after the Labour Court set aside his dismissal. We are going ahead with my lawyers to challenge the suspension because I m confident that I have not done anything wrong. All I want is a legitimate and fair disciplinary hearing process, he said. I will not be going to work because my suspension is still in effect. Motale said he was awaiting another formal charge from his employer. After the court judgement on Friday, I received a letter from The Citizen that they would send a new set of charges against me, he said.The Johannesburg Labour Court on Friday set aside the dismissal of Motale who was fired from the newspaper in December.The court s decision meant that Motale had to be reinstated and did not call for his suspension to be lifted now he has to face disciplinary charges in terms of the publication s disciplinary policy.PETER RAMOTHWALApeterr@thenewage.co.za
