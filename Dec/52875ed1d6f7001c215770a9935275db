Idols South Africa runner up Mthokozisi Ndaba will appear in the Hillbrow Magistrate’s Court on Monday, on an assault charge.    Hillbrow police spokesperson Sergeant Mduduzi Zondo on Sunday confirmed that Ndaba had been arrested last Thursday. Ndaba is accused of assaulting 21-year-old Neo Tsele at an apartment in Braamfontein, Johannesburg. Tsele posted images of the alleged assault on social media with the caption: “@Mthokozisi_Ndaba you brutally abused me. I don’t deserve to be beaten up like this by a stranger that I have never wronged, why? Why did you do this to me? You will run but you will not hide.” Ndaba last week announced that he had returned to Johannesburg to face the charges leveled against him.  In a statement, he said: “In light of the current allegations and a case opened against me, I have returned to Joburg again to co-operate  with the police regarding the matter. In as much as this has affected me, the craft God Blessed me with, the family, friends and  fans negatively but let us please let our South African law handle the matter rightfully.” He also called on his fans to take a stand against violence against women and children. -TNA Reporter
