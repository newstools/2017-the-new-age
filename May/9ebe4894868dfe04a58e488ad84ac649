Today is World Hypertension Day and it has emerged that an increase in sedentary lifestyles, obesity, lack of exercise and healthy eating, including high salt consumption by South Africans, are just some of the factors contributing to non-communicable diseases, such as hypertension. Avoiding health checks are as good as signing your death certificate, Harold Maropeng said.The 55 year old who has been living with high blood pressure since he was 40, said he spent his life avoiding health checks as he thought it was a woman thing . Lack of health education is killing South Africans. If you ask me to choose between living on chronic medication and having lived a healthy lifestyle to avoid the diagnosis in the first place, I would have chosen a healthy lifestyle in a split second, he said.Maropeng said living with high blood pressure was time and financially consuming. I have to queue at our local clinic for medication and do not forget that I hire a car to take me to the clinic, so this is the price I m paying for being ignorant, he said.Known as the silent killer , high blood pressure has no warning signs and most people are not aware that they have it.South Africa has one of the highest rates of hypertension in the world.The Heart and Stroke Foundation said about 25% of South African adults are hypertensive. The unfortunate consequence of this statistic is that many strokes and heart attacks in the South African population could be prevented if the undiagnosed and uncontrolled hypertensive South Africans were identified and provided with the necessary blood pressure lowering medication, Dr Krisela Steyn said.Associate professor and consultant in cardiology and cardiac MRI Prof Richard Nethononda, said: Throughout the world, but particularly in South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, hypertension is by far the most important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases responsible for death and disability from strokes, heart attacks, heart failure and kidney failure. Its significance derives not only from the catastrophic consequences of this condition, but also from the sheer numbers of people it affects. The foundation said one in three South Africans aged 15 years and older have hypertension 1 while those aged 50 and above have the highest rate of blood pressure of any country in the world.Of that, eight out of 10 are diagnosed with hypertension 2 while one in 10 children suffer from hypertension 3.LERATO DIALEleratod@thenewage.co.za
