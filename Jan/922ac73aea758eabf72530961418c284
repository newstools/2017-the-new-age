The Progressive Professionals Forum (PPF) has taken the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) to task, accusing the Red Berets of being political turncoats.The organisation s secretary-general Siphile Buthelezi fired a defensive salvo in response to remarks attributed to EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi, that PPF president Mzwanele Manyi s vocal opposition to President Jacob Zuma signing the Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment (Fica) Bill into law, was an attempt to shield Gupta family businesses from scrutiny.He said that the EFF s relationship with former UK Ambassador to SA Lord Robin Renwick was proof of the EFF duping their followers into believing that the party was pro-socialist. It is now crystal clear that since their visit and meeting in London with the chief colonial tzar, Lord Robin Renwick, EFF has turned from being a pseudosocialist noise maker to number one defender of white monopoly capital and is on a frolic to dance for its supper by trying too hard to impress Rupert et.al, harder than the DA, he said.Buthelezi said although the PPF had its misgivings about the bill being passed as is, that did not mean that the body was against enhancing good governance and combating corruption. The PPF is in full support of antiterrorism, anti-money laundering and corruption, he said.Buthelezi s comments come against the background of haggling in Parliament over Zuma signing the bill into law. Commentators have argued that the matter of amendments being made to the bill was a proxy war between the Presidency and national Treasury.However, Buthelezi said that this was not the case. He outlined the PPF s gripe with the bill. The Financial Action Task Force has made it clear that countries must implement such measures within their constitutional dictates, which this bill is not doing. As a result countries such as the US, UK and Germany are implementing their objectives of the task team within their constitutional dictates, agencies and structures.Instead the tabled FIC bill is completely unconstitutional and deserves to be scrapped in its entirety and reconceptualised. Buthelezi said that the PPF would continue to voice its opposition to the bill in it s current form. The PPF president will, devoid of any fear of favour or prejudices, continue to champion the mandate of the PPF, that of ensuring that the ideals of the Freedom Charter are immediately realised and that professionals in general and poor South Africans in particular claim their rightful place in their country, he said.-TNA REPORTER
