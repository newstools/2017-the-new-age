ANC president Jacob Zuma has made his intentions clear, the role of peacemaker, as he enters the final stretch at the helm of Africa s oldest liberation movement.In a bid to uproot factionalism and the use of slates in the ANC over the election of leadership, Zuma yesterday tabled a bold proposal that the party s constitution be amended to accommodate two deputy presidents in its organisational design.Delivering his closing remarks at the ANC s national policy conference in Johannesburg, Zuma told delegates that the governing party could no longer afford to pay lip service to stemming the tide of slate politics and endemic leadership squabbles.He suggested that changes be made to the party s top six NEC structure to also include two deputy secretaries-general. As a practical measure to put an end to the entrenched practice of slate politics and factionalism, branches should consider a proposal to have a second deputy president so as to include the candidate who obtained the second highest votes in the contest for the position of president. There is consensus that our movement can no longer afford to totally reject leaders who were preferred by a significant number of members to lead, he said.North West and Gauteng both tabled a similar proposal during discussions.Zuma s comments come against the background of the ANC s policy indaba concluding yesterday with contentious debate around the economy and the party s organisational design being deferred to branches for further discussion ahead of the party s December elective conference.ANC Gauteng chairperson Paul Mashatile said the province was in support of the proposal to expand the NEC structure. Gauteng had put it in our policy document, we had proposed two deputy presidents and two secretaries-general. It was actually us and the North West who came up with that proposal and other proposals were not necessarily opposed to it. We will go discuss it and refine it further, Mashatile said.The ANC Youth League believes the move would improve the political capacity of the ANC at Luthuli House so that it has the ability to effectively direct the policy processes of the state . We welcome the overwhelming acceptance of our recommendation for a second deputy secretary-general, the consideration of reducing the overall number of the NEC and the increase in the number of full-time NEC members, the ANCYL said in a statement.Zuma also called for the establishment of a monitoring unit based at Luthuli House. An effective monitoring and evaluation unit located at the head office is central to the ANC s position as the strategic centre of power. We still do not have such a unit capacitated at a desired level and this has resulted in the inability of the ANC to ensure the full implementation of its programme of action, he said.Meanwhile, in a plenary session of the ANC s economic transformation talk, the party s policy guru, Joel Netshitenzhe, was asked to apologise by Zuma supporters for misrepresenting the party s report on white monopoly capital.The party s steering committee has referred the matter to the NEC.BONOLO SELEBANO, SIFISO MAHLANGU AND MTHOKOZISI DUBEnews@thenewage.co.za
