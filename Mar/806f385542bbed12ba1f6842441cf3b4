Former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said the so-called intelligence report shouldn t be the basis to fire him.He was referring to an intelligence report that President Jacob Zuma submitted to ANC top six and the alliance.Gordhan dismissed that report as absolute nonsense .A visibly annoyed Gordhan says allegation that he had secret meetings was aimed at undermining the country, adding that sickened him.He further said if there were people whom didn t want them to perform their duties; they should have said so instead of undermining their integrity.On the issue of how the message of his withdrawal from the trip, Gordhan said upon his arrival in London he received a text.&#8220;Upon arrival in London, I received a text saying; &#8216;Come back, immediately&#8217;, he added.Gordhan also said that he didn t apply for the Finance Ministry position but he was instead asked to take the position as part of the national service. I didn&#8217;t apply for this job. I was asked to take this job as part of national service, Gordhan said, referring to the blunder of the firing of Nhlanhla Nene.Meanwhile, Mcebisi Jonas urged all South Africans to vigilant and look around at what was happening in the Country.&#8220;All of us as South Africans must wake up and smell the coffee. We are probably at a crossroads as the country,&#8221; Jonas said.During the questions both Gordhan and Jonas asked journalists to look at the issues around whether certain interests were being protected over others.Gordhan said that even if only some of the State of Capture report was true this would be worrying, he encouraged journalist to join the dots, and South African s to become activists.-Sipho Jack
