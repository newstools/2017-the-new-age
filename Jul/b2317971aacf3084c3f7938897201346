The Gauteng Human Settlements Department today removed 600 illegal land occupants in Syferfontein near Pretoria which is earmarked for development the department is busy with.According to departmental spokesperson, Keith Khoza, the department obtained an urgent court order to evict people who had invaded the land in Syferfontein. We are discouraging people from invading land as it delays development and today s action was to show that government will not sit and watch when anarchy prevails. Land invasion will not be tolerated anywhere in Gauteng, he said.The department partnered with the South African Police Services (SAPS), Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD), Red Ants and Westrand Metro Police to carry out the evictions.During the eviction there were instances of resistance from the illegal occupants however police managed to evict them without any of them being injured.&#8220;We call upon community leaders to work with government to discourage illegal land invasion in their communities that they lead. People should stop frustrating the programmes of development by government because it disadvantages to poor, said Khoza.-TNA Reporter
