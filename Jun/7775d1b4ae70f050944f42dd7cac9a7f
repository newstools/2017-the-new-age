A STAGGERING 90% of pupils in the province depend on feeding schemes but corruption means that some pupils are still going hungry.Many challenges seem to make this issue almost impossible to eradicate, even though there are programmes in place to solve the problem. Provincial department of education spokesperson Malibongwe Mtima said pupils first had to be declared as beneficiaries to benefit from feeding schemes. He said other problems included the quality of food and mismanagement of funds. The department gives the money to the school governing body to buy and make the food for the children. If the children are fed rotten food, it raises questionable parenting from the school governing body, Mtima said. Mtima said in such cases, the department of education investigated the problems and found the causes.He said when children were not fed properly because the allocated money was mismanaged, the department investigated, paying attention to what the country s laws stipulated regarding the issue at hand.The price of R22 for a loaf of bread would come as a surprise to the average South African consumer, even with the consistent rise in food prices over the past few years.It came as an even bigger surprise to the whistle-blower who alleged in a report to Corruption Watch that a supplier for his school s feeding scheme charged that amount for each loaf of bread delivered with food supplies. More than 8 million primary and high school children in some of the country s poorest areas are beneficiaries of the National School Nutrition Programme.The nutrition programme is part of the government s broader poverty alleviation drive and focuses on schools in needy communities. Through the nutrition programme, the department hoped to achieve three objectives: to contribute to enhanced learning capacity through school feeding programmes, to promote and support food production and improve food security in school communities, and to strengthen nutrition education in schools and communities.However, like other institutions and programmes in South Africa, the school nutrition programme seemed to be prone to corruption, judging by the more than 500 reports Corruption Watch has received as part of its campaign to fight corruption in schools.The Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal received the majority of complaints about the nutrition programme, which was not surprising as these were the two provinces with the most pupils on the programme, the Department of Basic Education records show.Last month, pupils at Zukhanye Senior Secondary School in Dimbaza demanded a food inspector to assess the quality of the food served. Pupils were assured a food inspector would be there to inspect the food within the week.Provincial deputy head for Equal Education Amanda Rinquent said students reported a significant improvement in the amount of the food they were getting.SISANDA MADWANTSI sisandam@thenewage.co.za&nbsp;
