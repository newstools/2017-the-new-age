One of the key issues in the four-day agenda for the 2017 Mining Indaba is the redeveloping, revitalising and recovery of the mining industry following recent years of economic downturn and labour unrest.In seeking to rebuild the industry, much regard must be had to creating a legal and regulatory framework that will be collaborative and effectively achieve the respective priorities for all stakeholders concerned, namely productivity and growth for industry including restoring investor confidence, regulatory compliance and economic transformation for the government and decent remuneration, job security and safety for labour.These concerns cannot be effectively addressed in absence of a certain and progressive regulatory framework. Key outstanding legal issues that exist in this regard is finalisation of the Draft Reviewed Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment Charter for the South African Mining and Minerals Industry 2016 (Draft reviewed Mining Charter) and the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act Amendment Bill B15-2013 (MPDRA)Amendment Bill).The recently launched Industrial Action Report of the Department of Labour launched on December 14 last year must also be observed. It provides that a trend in strikes occurrence has been recorded in the mining community, manufacturing and transport industries. The mining industry has shown relatively higher working days lost as compared to other industries from 2013-2015 .While the government s goal of economic transformation in the mining industry and South Africa generally must be highly prioritised, legislation and policy must be drafted in a manner that is clear and certain but importantly while seeking to achieve this goal legislation it should support growth and recovery of the industry rather than impede it with unintended consequences.Caution must be exercised in legislative drafting and implementation so as not to impose legislation, which may affect the stability and profitability of mining companies, while industry too cannot treat compliance to transformation as a tick box or acts as charity for the historically disadvantaged.All stakeholders must seek to achieve harmonisation of their respective priorities.For instance, while the proposed amendments pertaining to ownership elements in the draft Mining Charter are excessively onerous and unreasonable for a mining company, in the same breath, the once empowered always empowered rule cannot be accepted as it is in my opinion unconstitutional.It impedes progression to equality as it accommodates the retention of ownership of mineral resources in those who are historically advantaged by deeming them to be compliant to the transfer of ownership requirement, where there was in fact a disposal of the required levels of historically disadvantaged South Africans (HDSA) ownership.It is further contrary to the BEE act s objective of seeking to transform the racial composition of South African enterprises, read with the objectives of MPDRA to promote and sustain equitable access to mineral resources. See the following link to a site that will provide a detailed opinion in this regard, www.derebus.org.za.Similarly, the proposed amendments in the MPRDA amendment bill such as those that limit the ability of mining companies to export minerals in the absence of ministerial consent (section 26 (3)), not only has a potential impact on profitability, but it also has an impact on the companies growth and sustainability, particularly if exports forms part of their core business.Another key issue is the working conditions of employees in the mining industry. As correctly pointed out by the Minister in media reports of February 5 (on the day preceding the commencement of the Mining Indaba), the health and safety of employees is critical for the long-term sustainability of the mining industry .The plight and suffering of mine workers cannot be overstated, which consequently results in strikes and loss of productivity for mining companies, thus prejudicial for all stakeholders.There are underlying issues, besides wages, which mine workers suffer, such as continued oppression in the workplace and lack of safety, in some instances causing unnecessary fatalities.In seeking collaboration to rebuild the industry and satisfy all stakeholders to achieve growth and progression in the industry, these concerns cannot be ignored and greater accountability must be enforced by the Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) on mining companies in terms of holding mines accountable for safer working conditions and liability where this duty of care is not exercised.In this regard, while it may be necessary to impose section 54 stoppages in terms of the Mine Health and Safety Act, such impositions much be exercised procedurally, reasonably and where necessary, as unnecessary impositions result in loss of productivity and, as a consequence, it affects the profitability and sustainability of mines.Transformation in the industry is slow, racism and marginalisation of HDSAs continues.Enforcement that is strongly required from the DMR is the implementation of sound and progressive social and labour plan commitments with more stringent audit processes.Again, where there is lack of compliance there must be liability. Too often the DMR is presented information of MPRDA and Mining Charter violations by mining companies but little, if any, action is taken to the prejudice of mine workers and other mine employees particularly on issues of transformation.To effectively address regulatory concerns a greater consultative and collaborative process is required.It is important that industry and labour are extensively involved in amendments to policy and legislation.Such collaboration by stakeholders will effectively and efficiently contribute the redevelopment of the industry to the benefit of all stakeholders concerned and progressively achieve the respective objectives of all stakeholders concerned.Dineo PetaDineo Peta is a director at Peta Attorneys Inc.
