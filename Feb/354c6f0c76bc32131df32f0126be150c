Kanye West , one of Donald Trump &#8216;s biggest celebrity supporters, appeared to have deleted his tweets about his meeting last year with the then U.S. president-elect in which the two discussed multicultural issues.The influential rapper&#8217;s handful of Twitter entries from their Dec. 13 meeting at Trump Tower in New York, where West said he had wanted to discuss &#8220;bullying, supporting teachers, modernizing curriculums and violence in Chicago,&#8221; were missing from his account on Monday.After the meeting, West had also tweeted that he felt it &#8220;important to have a direct line of communication with our future president if we truly want change.&#8221;West , 39, emerged as one of Trump &#8216;s most high-profile supporters during the 2016 election campaign. He made headlines in November when he was booed at a concert for declaring his support for Trump , although he said he had not voted in the presidential election.It was not clear why the Trump tweets had been deleted but the &#8220;Jesus Walks&#8221; singer has been the target of outrage and sarcasm from fans on social media following the December meeting.West &#8216;s representatives did not return requests for comment.Celebrity website TMZ, quoting an unidentified source, said West had deleted the tweets because he was unhappy about Trump &#8216;s actions since taking office.These include a ban on travelers to the United States from seven predominantly Muslim nations and Trump saying he will &#8220;send in the Feds&#8221; to &#8220;fix the horrible &#8216;carnage&#8217; going on&#8221; in Chicago due to high crime rates.West was raised in Chicago.-Reuters
