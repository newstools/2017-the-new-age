The South African Police Service (SAPS) has announced that the briefing to outline processes to appoint new Hawks head has been postponed. Police ministry apologised for the inconvenience caused and said the department will communicate the future date to the media and other stakeholders. Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has noted the appeal brought to the Constitutional Court by Major General Berning Ntlemeza on the matter of considering condonation and leave. After the court’s consideration of Ntlemeza’s case, they dismissed his leave to appeal as it had no prospects of success. As a result of this, Mbalula said he will outline processes to appoint a new head of Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI). -TNA Reporter
