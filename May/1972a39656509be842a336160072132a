With 22000 job opportunities in the pipeline, the opening of the Maluti-A-Phofung Special Economic Zone (M-SEZ) by President Jacob Zuma has brought new and exciting hope to people in the area.During his address at the facility recently he said the Special Economic Zones programme was important to the economic development goals. The president stressed the importance these developments can contribute to the radical transformation of the South African economy.Through SEZ programme, South Africa also continued to play an important role in the attraction of foreign and domestic direct investment into the economy, Zuma said. He also mentioned that a massive R9bn in investment had already been earmarked for similar programmes across the country. The launch of the Maluti-a-Phofung Special Economic Zone should also remind us of the importance of strong partnerships between the public and private sectors. The government understands and appreciates the role of the private sector as an investor, innovator, trader, creator of jobs, and so on, and understands what the private sector requires to prosper and compete globally, the South African head of state saidReiterating the surge toward economic transformation he gave a clarion call for black industrialists and entrepreneurs in key value chains and industrial sectors of our economy to participate and get involved in ventures such as SEZs. Zuma said that that was the reason that those programmes were introduced and also gave assurances that his administration would play its part as a reliable, supportive and responsive partner.Also in attendance was Minister of Trade and Industry, Dr Rob Davies who made note that both the National Development Plan and Ipap have put out industrial development at the centre of the countries efforts to grow its industries.He said lessons had been learnt from all countries that had moved from being poor and underdeveloped to being rich and developed and had passed through the face of moving from dependence on primary commodity production and export to the production of value-added products through industrialisation. This is the only path that is compatible with the pursuit of our developmental and radical economic transformation goals in order to achieve greater inclusion and involvement of historically disadvantaged people in positions of leadership in our economy, Davies saidFree State Premier Ace Magashule said this Zone would transform Harrismith and said the jobs created would mean vibrancy in the area and infrastructure development for that very reason had already started to take place.Initially the zone would act as a logistics hub taking advantage of its strategic location on the Durban to Johannesburg route, additionally its road and rail links were excitingly and ideally positioned to service goods from the Durban port, the largest on the continent adding value in the logistics system.Furthermore the SEZ would assist the Durban port through decreasing of pressure it was experiencing by offering alternate storage, staging, packaging and agglomeration services to major users. This also made it possible for the creation of opportunities to offer an inter-modal transfer point that could relieve some of the current road congestion on this route.Free State Development Corporation s marketing and communications manager Sipho Tshabalala told the New Age: The zone will attract both domestic and foreign direct investment, stimu late the manufacturing of value-added products and offer incentives, promote business growth, revenue generation, employment creation, the export of value-added commodities, drive the industrial development and local benefi ciation and offer various tax incentives. Department of trade and industry said that many countries in Asia had used these special economic zones for accel eration in their economic development aims as well as addressing socio-eco nomic challenges.He said these zones were important tools for the success of rapid industri alisation, something that both the minister and Zuma both made abundantly clear. Some of the indicators for the suc cess of the programme are number and value of investments attracted, number of jobs created and contribution to GDP. More importantly, this programme, if properly supported, will contribute to the expansion and creation of new cit ies. The department said there were opportuni ties that were available for investors in infrastructure development provision side stream services (legal, call centres, consulting and so on) and development of other relevant facilities to support the SEZ development (schools, hospitals, housing, shopping centres).With job creation at the centre of the national development , these zones pro vided an opportunity for work, especially for young people, not only in the Free State but nationally as well. One of the key fundamental objec tives of the M-SEZ programme is job creation. Certainly, special economic zones will help the country in reducing the rate of unemployment in the country, with an astonishing 21000 jobs in the pipe line for phase 1 of the Musina-Makhado SEZ through the implementation of the proposed project. In addition, an estimated 10000 direct and indirect jobs will be created through the BAIC investment. If this is a trend for SEZs the M-SEZ can expect added benefits not only in the creation of jobs but a boost in industry as well as livelihoods of people eradicat ing poverty, taking growth in an upward trajectory.Wits head of school for the Wits School of Economic and Business Stud ies Prof Jannie Rossouw said that it was a good idea to have SEZs if there were necessary measures in place to prevent fraud.Hloni Mashigoprovinces@thenewage.co.za
