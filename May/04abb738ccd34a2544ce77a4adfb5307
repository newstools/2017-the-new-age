At a time when the majority of smartphones look and feel the same, the Moto Z is presenting us with something different. From my experience, the Lenovoowned Motorola deserves to be in the same discussions as your Samsung Galaxy S7, OnePlus 3 and others.Its MotoMods are creative and welldesigned. One thing that threw me off about this device was its lack of a headphone jack in favour of audio through the USB Type-C port. Because of this, you won t be able to charge and play music through headphones at the same time. You have to give it to Moto Z for taking thinness to a new level with a flagship-worthy stainless steel frame that measures 153.3 x 75.3 x 5.19mm.The flagship weighs just 139g. The selling point of the Moto Z is its Moto Mods, swappable accessories that can decorate the back adding extra functionality such as a battery pack or audio speaker. Moto Z is made from military aircraft-grade aluminium and stainless steel, it s both durable and stunning to look at. It has a water-repellent coating that protects it from the inside out. The Moto Z has this confusing detail, the rounded fingerprint reader on the front.It literally looks like a home button, but does nothing other than read your fingerprint. I pressed it so many times hoping it would take me to the home screen. The flagship offers a 13 megapixel shooter that focuses quickly and takes good photos, but it is not mind-blowing. The front-facing 5MP camera includes a wide-angle lens, which is great for fitting friends in the picture, with an extra flash on the front. What impressed me most about the Moto Z was that I can get through the day without charging the battery.-INDIE BOYCE|indiphileb@thenewage.co.za
