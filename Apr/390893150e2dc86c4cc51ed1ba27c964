African Bank is slowly reclaiming its glory after collapsing four years ago due to bad loans and going through business rescue.This is evident after credit ratings agency S&amp;P revised the bank s outlook from negative to stable.The Reserve Bank owns 50% of African Bank, followed by the Government Employees Pension Fund and a consortium of banks at 25% each.African Bank should not be confused with Abil (African Bank Investments Limited) as the businesses are no longer related.African Bank has been open and running normally since the departure of the curator, Tom Winterbroer.The positive revised outlook for African Bank comes at a time when other major banking players in South Africa have been sunk to junk status by both S&amp;P and Moody s, after the country s sovereign credit rating was downgraded to sub-investment grade.African Bank has improved its ratings to BB, from BB-, with a stable outlook, but is still not out of the danger zone, taking into account that the BB+, BB and BB- category is classified as non-investment grade by ratings agencies.What separates African Bank from the pack is the fact that S&amp;P has downgraded Nedbank, Absa, Investec and FirstRand to BB+ on a negative outlook while African Bank is on BB, a stable outlook. This suggests that although all banks are in junk status, African Bank shows some sign of improvement while the financial health of others appear to be at risk.Further, the agency highlighted that one of the significant points putting African Bank on a better position in terms of the review is the fact that the bank s capitalisation has improved markedly largely due to a significant reduction in the balance sheet, combined with better earnings than expected and the bank s strong capital level.Since September 2016, the bank paid about R3.3bn owed to the South African Reserve Bank to settle credit which was extended in 2014. Between April and September of 2016 residual debt services collected as much as R400m each month and was able to repay the central bank all of the money it owed.In February this year, Abil, an investment holding company, with income generated through dividends received from its 100% owned subsidiary Standard &amp; General Insurance Company resumed trading under the new name African Phoenix Investments.Abil shares were suspended on August 8, 2014. But now it is back again.New shares under a new name gives shareholders a scale of 1:1 ratio and existing Abil shareholders have started trading again. The shares have been trading for two months now.Banking analysts said the latest revised ratings from S&amp;P was a good sign that the bank is doing well, given its long journey following a massive crash at the beginning of August 2014. It is likely that the bank could be taken to a superior category, which is lower medium investment grade, just one notch above junk, an analyst said.Bernard Sathekgebernards@thenewage.co.za
