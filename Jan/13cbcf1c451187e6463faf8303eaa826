Striker Diego Costa&#8217;s career would be finished if he followed his former Chelsea team mates Oscar and Ramires to China, the London club&#8217;s former captain Ray Wilkins said on Monday.Spain international Costa, Chelsea&#8217;s top scorer this season, missed the 3-0 win at Leicester City on Saturday following media reports that he was suffering with a back injury.British newspapers said Costa is subject to interest from China where Oscar is earning a reported 500,000 pounds ($600,000) per week having signed for Shanghai SIPG this month.Fellow Brazilian Ramirez left London a year ago to join Jiangsu Suning.&#8220;If it&#8217;s financial and he wants to move to China, then I don&#8217;t quite understand it to be perfectly honest,&#8221; Wilkins, who also served as assistant manager at Chelsea under Carlo Ancelotti, told Sky Sports.&#8220;I think as a footballer if you&#8217;re going to go to China, now at 28 years of age, you&#8217;re basically saying, like Oscar, your career is finished.&#8220;You&#8217;re going there for the finance. Aren&#8217;t these young men earning enough in this country to enjoy playing their football?&#8221;Costa, understood to have a back injury, was photographed training alone at Chelsea&#8217;s training ground on Monday, fuelling speculation that he could leave in the January transfer window.Question marks about Costa&#8217;s Stamford Bridge future are all the more surprising as he has thrived under manager Antonio Conte this season, scoring 14 Premier League goals.&#8220;I would imagine Costa is well recompensed for what he does at Chelsea, and I would imagine there is a new deal for him there if he wishes to take it,&#8221; Wilkins said.Chelsea managed comfortably at Leicester without Costa, but their hopes of winning the title would suffer a blow if they were to lose the former Atletico Madrid hitman.&#8220;If they are going to win the Premier League they are going to need this guy,&#8221; Wilkins added.&#8220;He has been in fantastic form. Last year the guy was almost a disgrace, this year he has just been superb. He causes havoc for everyone.&#8221;-Reuters
