THE National Council of SPCAs (NSPCA) has offered a reward for information that could lead to the arrest of a dog rapist in Tonga, Mpumalanga.The council is offering R5000 to anyone who can provide information that could get the male suspect arrested. The Nelspruit SPCA laid criminal charges of bestiality and animal cruelty following a video of bestiality that was circulated on Facebook by a Sizwe-sethu Surprise Shongwe, who refused to provide the NSPCA with more information regarding the source of the video after an enquiry, the council said. The NSPCA is desperately looking for more information in order to arrest the culprit and remove the dog that was a victim in this barbaric sexual crime. We are concerned that the suffering of this dog is ongoing. The suspect has been identified as having a birthmark or tattoo of some sort on his left upper arm.Last year, a 22-year-old man from Nkohlakalo, also in Mpumalanga, was forced to eat his own faeces after he was accused of raping a puppy.A few weeks before that a 25-year-old man was arrested after he was caught committing an act of bestiality with a goat in a kraal. Tonga police said they were working hard to track down the suspect. 701295
