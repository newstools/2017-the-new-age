The increase in the number of patients, the burden of HIV and tuberculosis, the overload in health facilities and re emerging infectious diseases are contributing to the poor compliance results at health facilities in Gauteng.The Department of Labour carried out inspections for bio-hazard, ventialtion and indoor air quality, change rooms compliance, medical surveillance of employees and other safety issues.That is according to a reply by Gauteng health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa to the DA s Jack Bloom in the legislature.Ramkgopa said the Department of Labour inspectorate had conducted various audits and inspections at several facilities in the past three years.Chris Hani Baragwanath, Helen Joseph and Pretoria West hospitals among others received either a noncompliance finding or an improvement compliance notice.According to Ramakhopa no facility was found to have deteriorated during inspections. There s been an improvement in general at all these facilities based on the outcome of internal departmental audits and inspections. Continuous support is given from staff in the directorate of healthcare waste and occupational hygiene risk management to facilities in mitigating the adverse findings of the Department of Labour, the MEC said.Bloom, however, said he was appalled that not a single Gauteng hospital was compliant in health workers and patient safety saying non-compliance increased the risk of becoming infected. It is very worrying because hazardous biological agents are infectious and toxic. They cause allergic reactions such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis allergic rhinitis some types of asthma and organic dust toxic syndrome, he said.Bloom said huge maintenance backlog led to contraventions of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, increasing risks such as the recent ceiling collapse incident at the Charlotte Maxeke Hospital.leratod@thenewage.co.za
