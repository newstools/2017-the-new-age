The Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) has condemned the killing of one of its members during a roadblock in Soweto on Friday. Zanele Neleni, aged 38, was allegedly run over while standing outside his vehicle on Impala Road. JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar said the driver of the car is recovering in hospital and will be arrested once he recovers. “The driver was injured and will appear in the Protea Magistrate’s Court to face charges of reckless and negligent driving and culpable homicide once he makes full recovery,” Minnaar said. Minnaar said Neleni was the fourth officer to be killed this way this year. -TNA Reporter
