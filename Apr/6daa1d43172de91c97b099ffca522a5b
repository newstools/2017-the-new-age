Sibanye Gold continues to turn unwanted mines into profitable concerns as it plans to tap shareholders for about $1bn (R13bn) to partly fund a takeover of US-based Stillwater Mining, it said yesterday, a day after the deal secured US regulatory approval.The Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, which examines deals for potential national security concerns, has cleared Sibanye s $2.2bn (R29.4bn) takeover of the country s sole platinum and palladium miner. The deal will increase South Africa s grip over global platinum and palladium supply. It will also underline Sibanye CEO Neal Froneman s determination to branch out of gold mining and South Africa. Sibanye management and board has determined that a$1bn equity capital raise, through the rights offer, is optimal given current market conditions, it said in a statement. The company also said it would raise a further $1bn in debt, most likely in the bond market, to fund the transaction. It expects the two tranches of capital to be raised by the end of June. The deal is still subject to shareholder votes of both companies. Stillwater and Sibanye have scheduled shareholder meetings on April 25 to vote on the proposed merger.Sibanye has been on a move since 2015, buying a series of unwanted mines, and that is what made the company to become what it is today as others closed shop. Two years back, the group bought Aquarius Platinum for $294m and also purchased Anglo American Platinum s Rustenburg operations for about R4.5bn. Sibanye owns and operates highquality gold and platinum operations, and is the largest individual producer of gold from South Africa, one of the 10 largest gold producers globally and the world s fifth largest producer of platinum group metals.Industry analysts say it is poised to become the world s third-largest producer of palladium if plans to buy US palladium and platinum miner Stillwater become a done deal.
