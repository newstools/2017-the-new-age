A story which implicated the Gupta family in attempted diamond smuggling has been bust and the so-called suspicious material found in a bag was nothing other than nuts.There is no truth in the City Press lavish claims, published in an article entitled The Guptas and the Box of Gems, suggesting that the family tried to fly out of the country with a bag of diamonds from the Oppenheimer family s private VIP terminal at OR Tambo International Airport.At least five independent statements made by witnesses during an inquiry into the matter have surfaced and each one independently confirms that the bag containing suspicious material was opened in front of several witnesses and removed because the pilot was unclear whether the plane s destination would allow agricultural items such as groundnuts, wheat and salt through customs.On Sunday, the City Press published an investigative story describing a Gupta-owned jet with tail number ZS-AKG preparing to depart from Fireblade Aviation s VVIP terminal on April 13 when X-ray scanners picked up something suspicious .Using three unnamed sources, the article then claimed that the Gupta security officer refused to have the bag searched and left with the bag.When Fireblade security asked to see what was inside, a Gupta security staffer refused, took the bag from the counter and left. One of the sources said that the principal passenger was one of the three Gupta brothers. In the suitcase was a box containing what looked like stones, more precisely, diamonds, the story claimed.The real story is, in fact, according to a series of signed statements in The New Age s sister TV channel ANN7 s possession far less exciting.Indeed Fireblade employee Desmond Knoetze admits that there was suspicious material in two of the bags destined for the plane.The luggage went through the X-ray machines and two baggage pieces were sent back for rescanning . One image, the statement says, looked like electronics, the other looked very contaminated . Knoetze says this was reported to him by his security officer, identified only as Daniel.Knoetze then called the security manager, Hannes Strampe and the captain so that he could open both of the suitcases.When the cases were opened the smaller brown bag was filled with an iPhone, iPad, Apple electronics and chargers, VGA cables etc , the big green bag was filled with jars with different kind of nuts and wheat .The captain declined to take the green bag as he was uncertain of its reception at the plane s destination of Dubai.The City Press story, which was subsequently followed up by Business Day, was so thinly sourced that they had no corroborating evidence from the Hawks, which was called in to investigate, the Gupta family, Home Affairs or even details of the event from the staff at the Oppenheimer-owned Fireblade Aviation.The only confirmation the story had was one that an incident did occur between business mogul Nicky Oppenheimer and Fireblade.The Oppenheimers and Fireblade are in a legal battle to have their VVIP private terminal recognised by the Home Affairs Department. There have been claims that this process was under way but scuppered when the relationship between the family and the Guptas soured.The Oppenheimers have claimed that the Guptas tried to hijack the project.The idea behind the terminal is to allow local and foreign dignitaries to land and go through immigration and customs in minutes, without the hassle of OR Tambo International Airport, while their jets are being parked in Fireblade s hangars. Knoetze s statement is corroborated by four others which also explain that the Gupta family security then took the green bag from the airport.-Kalden Ongmu
