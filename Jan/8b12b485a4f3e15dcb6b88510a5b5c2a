HE MAY be a forgotten man locally, but Bongani Zungu has finally shown he is ready to announce his playing skills in Portugal s second tier.Zungu started his first match for Vitoria Guimaraes, playing the entire match alongside Joao Aurelio as they dismantled Braga 2-1 at the Braga Municipal Stadium at the weekend.The former Mamelodi Sundowns man made a slow start to his career in Europe as he struggled to recover from a fractured shin bone.He had to seek advice from Benni McCarthy, who won the Uefa Champions League with Portuguese giants FC Porto, as he slowly got to grips with life in the Iberian peninsula.Despite joining in February, Zungu only made his debut in December in a Taca de Portugal Placard match having regained full fitness.This was after he shrugged off suggestions he could leave on loan as he strove to regain his form and there was also talk Sundowns could lure him back home.But it seems nothing beats sheer hard work and in the case of Zungu it s been determination and dedication that has seen him win a place in the starting team.He combined eloquently with Aurelio against Braga and on the basis of the reviews he got the 24-year-old Zungu should find his name in the starting line-up more often.Elsewhere, Kamohelo Mokotjo started his 17th match for Dutch side FC Twente as they saw off Heracles 1-0 at home, continuing his form beyond the festive break.Mokotjo has been one of the most consistent performers for Twente, often getting due recognition since the season started.It has been a great weekend too for Bafana Bafana midfielder Andile Jali, who started for Belgian side Oostende when they edged out Waasland-Beveren.Meanwhile, things are looking good for Lehlogonolo Masalesa who is yet to miss a match for Greek side Larisa since he joined in the January transfer window.He came on as a halftime substitute as Larisa played to a goalless draw against Platanias on Sunday in what was his fourth match.KGOMOTSO SETHUSHAkgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
