AS TIGHT as the Absa Premiership title race looks at the moment, Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela believes the eventual champions will be made clear after this weekend s fixtures that sees Bidvest Wits and Sundowns in action tonight and on Sunday.Log leaders Wits host a resurgent Orlando Pirates side tonight, while second-placed Sundowns welcome Platinum Stars at the Lucas Moripe Stadium. Wits lead Sundowns by a point with five matches remaining. The league race remains wide open and Komphela, whose Chiefs side twice gave away leads when Simphiwe Tshabalala scored against SuperSport United last weekend, believes the champions elect will show their hand by the end of the week. Let s wait for the closures of the two matches. Let s see what happens at the end of this week. There are matches again this week. As soon as everybody is on the same tally, then we can start looking at it. But the title race is still open. Make no mistake. Chiefs chances of winning the title are slim and Komphela said they at least needed to finish in the top three to give themselves a chance of playing in the CAF Champions League or Confederation Cup next year. Chiefs on fourth on the log standings with 46 points, five behind leaders Wits, but having also played a match more than Wits and Sundowns. It is important for Chiefs to campaign in CAF competitions and win championships. But it is not easy as I have always mentioned, there are phases in everything with football, Komphela said. There is a phase where everything comes to a halt and then you must start the process again and then it goes on to the maturity stage when you have to deliver the goods. I think we are at a stage where we are comfortable now, there is cohesion and an understanding from our supporters and we should be in a position to deliver from there. nevillek@thenewage.co.za-Neville Khoza
