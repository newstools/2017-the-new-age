The Northern Cape Premier Sylvia Lucas will today rescind her decision to reshuffle members of the provincial legislature, the provincial ANC said in a statement today.The executives had been reshuffled prior to the provincial conference that was held in Colesberg in April, a decision that was highly controversial and not acceptable to the top structures of provincial executive committee (PEC).Lucas has since met with the top structure of the PEC in May. In the meeting the officials stated their dissatisfaction with the decision taken by the premier to reshuffle her executives without consulting the party. The premier is of the view that she does not wish to discuss internal party politics in the media space. What she wishes to state categorically she would not concede to the request by the officials to reverse her decision, the statement read.However, in a turn of events the ANC confirmed today that she would reverse her decision to reshuffle the executives.The ANC welcomed the decision as progressive, reminding its members that all strategic decisions should be taken in consultation with the highest provincial structure. ANC public representatives serve at the behest of the ANC, the ANC said in a statement.-Sipho Jack
