&#8220;The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) has demanded that certain senior executives be suspended ahead because of corruption allegations.The union said it was &#8220;celebrating another victory in the labour court, when SAA and SAA Technical attempted to block a march against corruption at the national carrier.&#8220;It s no secret that SAA s financial woes are purely as a result of looting and corruption taking place at the airline. Unfortunately, SAA got more than it bargained for at the Labour court and their attempts failed dismally&#8221; the union said in a statement.&#8220;The Labour court realised that our members are waging an honourable fight against corruption at the airline, and sided with us.&#8220;One of NUMSA s demands is that senior executive managers at SAA who have been implicated in corruption must immediately be placed on suspension pending a disciplinary process.&#8221;The union referred to several forensic investigations which have highlighted corruption and highlighted failings in SAA and SAAT.&#8220;There have been several forensic investigations into the SOE conducted by various firms including one conducted by Open Waters; another by Ernst and Young (EY), as well as an investigation by Edward Nathan Sonnenberg (ENS),&#8221; the union said.The corruption and maladministration highlighted in the EY and ENS reports into SAA have been extensively covered by ANN7 special investigations.&#8220;These reports detail incidents of wide scale looting and corruption which is taking place at SAA. SAA refused to take action against these executives despite them being implicated in these reports for alleged corruption,&#8221; Numsa statement reads.&#8220;The Labour Court found in our favour and ordered that the following executives must be suspended pending an investigation into corruption: Former SAA acting CEO Musa Zwane; Chaile Makaleng, HOD Baseline Maintenance; Nontsasa Memela, HOD Procurement; and Princess Tshabalala who also in Procurement,&#8221; Numsa said in the statementThe court also ordered that SAA must appoint an independent advocate who is acceptable to both parties to chair any disciplinary hearing that may follow. This is to ensure that the airline doesn t manipulate the process in order to protect senior managers.Furthermore, the court also ordered that NUMSA must be allowed to give evidence during the investigation.Numsa called off its proposed strike in protest against the corruption. &#8211;ANN7 reporter&nbsp;
