Cosatu yesterday blamed the government for the increase in youth unemployment which, according to the latest Stats SA report, has reached a staggering 38.6%. The government has outsourced youth unemployment to the private sector. We have argued that the government needs to be more hands on to address unemployment, Cosatu national spokesperson Sizwe Pamla said.Initiatives such as the Employment Tax Incentive Act (ETIA), known as youth the wage subsidy are in the spotlight as they are seen to address economic issues facing the youth.Cosatu was disgruntled with ETIA and how it was meant to offer incentives to employers by reducing their taxes for hiring young job seekers. In that way young people would gain the skills and experience needed to propel the economy forward. ETIA was meant to cover the youth, designated vulnerable sectors and special economic zones (SEZs). However, no sectors or SEZs have been designated or included, Pamla said.The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) says education is the key in order to equip the youth with skills development that alleviate unemployment. Through our youth wing, we are able to upgrade the level of education through workshops, short courses and seminars assisted by state-owned entities, Numsa said.However, the different policies with regard to addressing youth matters have yielded no successes.Numsa said there is still a lot that needs to be done in ensuring the policies confront the day-to-day challenges of the youth. The youth wage subsidy as a policy is not ideal as it is essentially a way to reward businesses for hiring young people and paying them starvation wages, Numsa said.Refilwe Magashulenews@thenewage.co.za
