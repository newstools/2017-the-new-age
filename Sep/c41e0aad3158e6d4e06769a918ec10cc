Outspoken ANC MP Dr. Makhosi Khoza will reportedly make a significant announcement regarding her future in the ruling party in a few days.Khoza has been at loggerheads with some members of her organisation following a series of remarks denouncing the current party leadership and calling for President Jacob Zuma to step down.Khoza ahead of a scheduled disciplinary hearing at the weekend wrote a letter to the disciplinary committee, ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe and Chief Whip, Jackson Mthembu informing them that she would not subject herself to disciplinary processes initiated by a KZN Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) which has been declared invalid.Last week the Pietermaritzburg High Court declared the provincial ANC 2015 elective conference unlawful and void.&#8220;For that reason alone, apart from the other material flaws in the disciplinary process initiated against me, the rescheduled disciplinary hearing is a nullity and cannot be proceeded with. Any conduct to the contrary will, at the very least, be in constructive contempt of the Judgment and unlawful,&#8221; said Khoza in her letter.&#8220;It follows as a matter of course that any potential disciplinary steps to be taken, could only be decided upon by a newly elected PEC, after a constitutionally compliant Provincial Elective Conference has taken place and new Provincial Office Bearers have been duly elected,&#8221; she added.However, following her snubbing of the disciplinary proceedings, the KZN ANC said they would reconvene on 1 October.The charges against Khoza include &#8220;making an utterance which brings or could bring ANC into disrepute&#8221;.ANC KZN spokesperson Mdumiseni Ntuli said that come, October 1, the work of the disciplinary committee would continue irrespective of whether Khoza is in attendance.Ntuli added that Khoza should not solely rely on the fact that the elective conference was declared invalid to contest the disciplinary processes.&#8220;Hypothetically speaking even if the PEC is set aside&#8230;the new team will inherit the responsibilities of the provincial executive committee which includes matters of disciplinary hearings,&#8221; said Ntuli.-Siphiwe Mchunu
