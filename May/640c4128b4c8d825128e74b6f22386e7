Radamel Falcao scored twice as Monaco strode to within a point of the Ligue 1 title after Sunday&#8217;s 4-0 home win over Lille left them on the verge of dethroning Paris Saint-Germain.The Colombian striker netted either side of a Bernardo Silva goal before Junior Alonso bundled into his own net as Monaco reeled off a 10th straight Ligue 1 victory, although PSG&#8217;s 5-0 rout of Saint-Etienne prevented Leonardo Jardim&#8217;s side from officially securing the title.Monaco lead the reigning champions by three points &#8212; and have a game in hand against Saint-Etienne on Wednesday &#8212; ahead of next weekend&#8217;s final round of matches, but their vastly superior goal difference all but guarantees them an eighth French league crown.-AFP
