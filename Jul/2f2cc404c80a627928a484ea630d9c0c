Emergency workers have retrieved 11 bodies so far from a bus crash Monday in southern Germany, Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said, adding that work was ongoing to find another seven people who are believed dead.The flames that engulfed the bus &#8220;were so strong that only steel parts are still recognisable on the bus, and from that you can understand what it means for the people on this bus,&#8221; he said, adding that the remains of &#8220;11 people have been recovered&#8221; so far.-AFP
