Experienced Burnley midfielder Dean Marney is set to miss the rest of the season after he sustained a cruciate knee ligament injury during Sunday&#8217;s 2-1 Premier League defeat at Arsenal.The 32-year-old, who suffered a similar injury in February 2015, has been a regular feature in Burnley&#8217;s first team, making 21 league starts this season.&#8220;Dean&#8217;s seeing a specialist today but unfortunately he has done his right cruciate, which is the one he did before. There&#8217;s obviously a long period of rehab for that one,&#8221; manager Sean Dyche told reporters on Thursday.&#8220;He will definitely be out for the season, but he&#8217;s come through that once before so he knows the script. It&#8217;s a blow for him and a blow for us. He&#8217;s a tough-minded man and knows he&#8217;s got the full support of everyone here.&#8221;Burnley host second-tier side Bristol City in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Saturday before they face Leicester City in the league three days later.-Reuters
