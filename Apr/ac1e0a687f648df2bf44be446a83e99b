While his plans and the squad that will be playing in the new international season are starting to take shape, Springboks coach Allister Coetzee said he will not close the door on players who have impressed him.The Springbok coach was at the second national team camp held in Stellenbosch, where his team was focuses on defence and scrummaging. The camp, which saw a total of 41 players attending, is a followup on the camp held in Johannesburg, where thev emphasis was on attack. Coetzee has urged players who missed the first two camps not to lose hope. He said their time might well come in the final camp before the Springboks take on the might of France. There are many players who weren t invited to the first camp, but who attended the Stellenbosch camp after playing consistently well to force their way into the extended group and there will be others who will be invited to the third camp who are not here now, Coetzee said.New defence coach Brendan Venter also got to work with the players in Stellenbosch. The only injury concern from the camp was Lions fullback Andries Coetzee who sustained a hamstring strain at the warmup on Monday. It was announced that the player will be further managed by his franchise medical team to ensure he is fully fit in the next coming weeks.Meanwhile, Coetzee is yet to decide on who will lead the Springboks in the three Test series against France. Bulls hooker Adriaan Strauss led the Boks last year but has since retired from Test rugby. There is much speculation going around on who the replacement will be, with French-based Duane Vermeulen s name high on the list.-Mmasekepe Matsebane|mmasekepem@thenewage. co.za
