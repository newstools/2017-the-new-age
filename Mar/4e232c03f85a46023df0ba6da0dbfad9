Ahmed Kathrada, born in a small platteland dorpie, Schweizer-Reneke a town where Afrikaans was the lingua franca, became a formidable freedom fighter.In the ANC comrade Kathrada is regarded among the few who were truly tempered by the steel.In the book Reflections In Prison edited by comrade Mac Maharaj, a description of an incident where comrade Kathrada is confronted by his torturer, Rooi Rus, Comrade Kathy recited a poem written by Jan Celliers, an Afrikaans speaking poet.Ek hou van man wat sy man kan staanEk hou van arm wat slag kan slaan I.C. Oog wat nie wyk, wat n bars kan kykEn n wil wat so vas soos n klipsteen staan.This poem describes uncle Kathrada, fearless, dauntless courage and integrity based on firm principals. Among the activist community Kathy stands out as a hero who will say what is needed to be said and he is heard even by those who may disagree with his views.During the ANC s Durban conference in 1991, comrade Kathy voted against the 30% quota for women in leadership structures of the ANC. His argument was clear, that a quota places a limit on the number of women who have the ability to lead.Comrade Kathy focussed much of his life on building a united, non- racial, non-sexist and democratic South Africa.He was unsparing in his constructive criticism of an ANC that appeared to move in a direction which could marginalise people who were not African. He believed that the future of all black South Africans was bound together.Commrade Kathy assisted to develop the class character of sections of the black community and pointed out that an assumption that people of Indian origin or so called coloured people, might have some middle class people, but the vast majority of the people in both these groups within the black majority were still subjected to abject poverty as part of the legacy of apartheid.For many scholars and researchers comrade Kathrada s papers are sourced as reference to discuss the national question in this country.He was very clear that non-racialism as part of the goals of the national democratic revolution, was not negotiable, but given the diversity of our country a necessity.Transformation of our country included the will of the all the people to be a part of the actions we take.Comrade Kathrada was critical of the leadership of the ANC. He voiced his concerns about the state of the organisation and yet did not agree to work outside the ANC. He is part of the DNA of the liberation movement.The respect that many of us have for uncle Kathy is borne from his selflessness and the principled stance he took on matters that affected the ANC.The legacy he leaves is one of fearless opposition to anything that hurts the ANC and its primary task to transform our country from apartheid and colonialism of a special type in a country where we all benefit from the wealth of the land and are educated, have healthcare we can afford, live in firm shelters, have affordable food and affordable transport among other needs.He decried corruption by any person for whatever purpose as wrong and as an injustice which must be fought with whatever means necessary.One can only stand in awe of this giant who had one agenda and that was to be a servant of the people.Thank you uncle Kathy we will love you for ever and we will miss your rapier like tongue , sharp wit and your deep understanding of human nature.Jessie DuarteJessie Duarte is ANC deputy secretary-general
