India&#8217;s government acknowledged Tuesday that its controversial decision to withdraw high-value bank notes from circulation has had an &#8220;adverse impact&#8221; on the economy as it lowered its growth forecast.In an annual survey published on the eve of the budget, the government said &#8220;the adverse impact of demonetisation on GDP (gross domestic product) growth will be transitional&#8221; while Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said it would have significant implications for GDP.In the survey, the government lowered its growth forecast for 2016-17 to 7.1 percent, down from 7.6 percent in the previous fiscal year.But the survey said the &#8220;estimate is based mainly on information for the first seven to eight months of the financial year&#8221;, in other words before the shock move in November to pull all 500 ($7.30) and 1,000 rupee notes from circulation &#8212; representing nearly 86 percent of the cash in the system.Jaitley said he expected cash supplies would be fully &#8220;replenished&#8221; by the end of March and the economy should then &#8220;revert to normal&#8221;, projecting growth in 2017-18 to be in the range of 6.75 to 7.5 percent.The survey by the government&#8217;s chief economic advisor, Arvind Subramanian, said the so-called demonetisation scheme had a series of negative impacts, including job losses and a decline in income for farmers.&#8220;Growth slowed as demonetisation reduced demand &#8230; and increased uncertainty,&#8221; said the survey.It did however say that the scheme &#8220;could be beneficial in the long-run&#8221; if it leads to a fall in corruption and fewer cash transactions that are mainly designed to avoid paying taxes.By painting demonetisation as a blitz on corruption and cash-hoarding that will ultimately boost tax revenues, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has so far escaped a major backlash.While there were massive queues outside banks in the weeks afterwards, they have now subsided while limits on withdrawals have eased.India&#8217;s central bank announced late Monday that it would ease some of the restrictions on cash withdrawals although most savers are still only allowed to withdrawal a maximum of 24,000 rupees in cash each week.-AFP &nbsp;
