Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela has become irritated by the manner in which his side has thrown away matches of late.In their last three matches, Chiefs have conceded late on to drop points in games they could easily have won or drawn, which has seen them drop out of the race for the league title. On Saturday night at FNB Stadium, Amakhosi looked to have done enough to bag the three points when Ryan Moon came off the bench to hand his side the lead midway through the second half against Golden Arrows.But Knox Mutizwa bagged an equaliser in dramatic fashion with the last kick of the match. It was Chiefs third consecutive match in which they conceded in stoppage time. Very disappointed and it s not the first time. I don t know how many setbacks we have suffered like this, Komphela said. You don t learn from this and each time it happens you ask yourself but why should it be happening so often? There was no reason for us not to manage that, you know four minutes is gone and it is just maybe the last kick. It is so unfortunate that we concede again, did it happen before? Several times. Chiefs conceded right at the death in the 3-2 loss to Cape Town City as well as the 2-2 draw against SuperSport United. I strongly believe that we haven t been fair with our supporters in the sense that moments like this, they erase everything that they had seen throughout the match and it s just sad, Komphela said. One had to acknowledge the fact that the opponent played a good game, compliments must also go to the coach, Clinton Larsen. You just can t comprehend this, maybe if is happens once you say we made a mistake, but it happens so consistently you don t know why we should suffer such setbacks. Chiefs remain fourth on the log standings with 47 points with three matches to play.-NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
