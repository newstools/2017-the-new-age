Medium and large businesses with multinational ties will soon have to start supplying the South African Revenue Service (Sars) with more detailed reports of their relationships and transactions with entities residing in other countries.Sars has beefed up its transfer pricing division and is actively involved in the international initiative to stop base erosion and profit shifting by multinational companies.This is according to Di Seccombe, Mazars SA head of national tax training. Not only does Sars want to stop this from happening in South Africa, it also wants to stop South African companies from doing the same in other countries. Seccombe said this initiative aimed to stop multinational companies from shifting their profits out of the country to more tax-friendly jurisdictions. A very common way that multinational companies are doing this is by having their subsidiaries pay them a substantial management fee . The subsidiary can, of course, deduct this fee from its own income tax and that money is effectively taken out of the country before there is a chance to tax that profit. The Davis Tax Committee has stated that this was one of the main issues of lost tax revenue in the country and has estimated that the amount of money being bled out of the country totals billions of rands each year, she said.Seccombe said local companies would need to take note of a number of new requirements this year, if their tax returns are to remain compliant.Firstly, the South African Tax Administration Act requires that a master file, which contains high level information of the entire multinational groups operations in a single document, available to all tax authorities where the multinational group has operations, and a local file, which contains information regarding the jurisdictional activities of the multinational entities available to local tax authorities within the jurisdiction, is submitted with corporate tax returns.Secondly, in the event of a Sars transfer pricing audit additional mandatory transfer pricing documentation has to be kept in terms of the record keeping provisions as set out in the Tax Admin Act and the regulations issued on October 28, 2016. The regulation requires that specific information is kept where the cross-border related party transactions are in excess of R100m or reasonably expected to exceed the R100m for a transfer pricing audit. Other transaction specific information should also be kept for cross-border transactions in excess of R5m that are included in the R100m. Multinational companies, trusts and individuals in the country should consider all transactions whether transacted at arm s length or not, she said.Seccombe said companies that are part of a multinational group might have their transactions within the group scrutinised by Sars.Sello Rabothatasellor@thenewage.co.za
