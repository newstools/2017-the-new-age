Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan will be the main act in Parliament this week following last week s state of the nation address.On Wednesday, Gordhan will deliver his budget speech, giving the nation his prognosis of its financial health, his remedies as well as his intentions of reining the state s revenue from taxes.This year s budget, Gordhan s second since he was reappointed as finance minister, will take place with rumours swirling over his imminent axing.For weeks it s been speculated that former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe was headed for parliament as an ANC member.Now that the news is official, the rumour mill is wondering whether speculation about him replacing Gordhan after being sworn in is also true.Whatever the outcome, this is Gordhan s week and he will hold centre stage as the country, financial markets, the continent and investors listen to take their cues from him.The full extent of rhino poaching and discussions on the ad hoc committee into the SABC are two of the main subjects that will start off a week of deliberations for parliametary committees this week. Tomorrow, the portfolio committee on environmental affairs will hear about wildlife crimes and plans to get the courts to impose stiffer sentences for rhino poaching and killing.The world of broadcasting will also come under the purview of two different committees; tomorrow, the ad hoc committee on the SABC board inquiry will consider its final report, due to be tabled in Parliament next Tuesday, while the portfolio committee on communications will meet to deliberate and adopt a report recommending candidates for appointment to the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa.On the same day that Gordhan delivers his budget, the nation will hear the latest crime statistics when the SAPS briefs the police portfolio committee on the topic.The SAPS will also talk about anti-crime operations launched during the festive season.Outside parliament, President Jacob Zuma will be at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban, tomorrow in his role as commander-in-chief to officiate at the sixth Armed Forces Day celebrations.This year s event will also commemorate the centenary of the sinking of the SS Mendi steamship, which sank in the English Channel and claimed the lives of more than 600 black South Africans during the First World War.-Dennis Cruywagen
