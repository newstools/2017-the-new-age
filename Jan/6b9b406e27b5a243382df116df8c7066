Outgoing head of the African Union Commission Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has on Monday urged continental leaders to focus on development of the youth in order to secure the continent&#8217;s future.&#8220;The continent has 200 million young men and women ages 15 to 24 years. By 2025, a quarter of the world s youth under 25 will be African,&#8221; said Dlamini-Zuma.&#8220;As the rest of the world ages, Africa will remain a young continent. This is the comparative advantage we have, which must be translated into a demographic dividend,&#8221; continued Dlaimini-Zuma.Dlamini-Zuma was addressing the opening of the 28th AU Summit in Addis Ababa, Ethopia.She emphasised the need to harness Africa&#8217;s youthful population as an added advantage to reaching its development goals.&#8220;&#8230;we must provide all African boys, girls and young people with opportunities to be in school, complete secondary education, have access to vocational training and universities, to expand their knowledge of science, mathematics, engineering and technology,&#8221; said Dlamini-Zuma.&#8220;Within this, we must pay special attention to creating opportunities for girls and young women, so that we use the full potential of all our resources,&#8221; she continued.However Dlamini-Zuma also warned continental leaders that rampant youth unemployment posed a threat to the developmental ambitions invested in the continent&#8217;s youthful demographic.&#8220;Since sixty percent of the unemployed are young, with their unemployment rate double that of adults, we must resolve to decisively tackle youth unemployment,&#8221; she said.&#8220;Our programmes of beneficiation and economic diversification, of agricultural modernisation and the development of agro-processing, must of necessity, target the creation of jobs and economic opportunities for young entrepreneurs,&#8221; continued Dlamini-Zuma.The summit was also attended by Antonio Guterres who became United Nations Secretary-General on 1 January 2017.Guterres attending his first summit as the newly elected UN Chief took the time to wish Dlamini-Zuma farewell and &#8220;all the best in her future endeavours.&#8221;Guterras also committed to working closely with the Regional Economic Communities across the continent saying &#8220;they have been at the forefront of efforts to achieve peace and security on the continent and they are driving forces for achieving Africa s development aims.&#8221;Newly appointed @UN SG @antonioguterres addressing the #28thAUSummit pic.twitter.com/3bfDLdg7o1 African Union (@_AfricanUnion) January 30, 2017Meanwhile, heads of state from across the continent are expected today to elect a new commission chairperson to replace Dlamini-Zuma.Five candidates are looking to replace Dlamini-Zuma, the first woman to lead the AU commission.They are Kenya s foreign minister Amina Mohamed, Abdoulaye Bathily, who is a Senegalese diplomat and academic; Chadian foreign minister Moussa Faki Mahamat, veteran politician from Botswana, Pelonomi Venson-Moitoi and Mba Mokuy who previously served as a senior adviser to Equatorial Guinea s President.Earlier on Monday President Alpha Conde of Guinea was elected the new chairperson of the African Union taking over from President of Chad, Idris Deby.H.E.
