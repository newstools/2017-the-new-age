He may project an air of serenity and calm, but Springboks coach Allister Coetzee cannot sidestep the fact that having only two natural centres in his team ahead of the first Test against France at Loftus Versfeld Stadium is not ideal.With less than five days to go till the first Test of the year, the Boks lack depth in midfield, with Damian de Allende, Lionel Mapoe and Lukhanyo Am out injured. Jan Serfontein and Frans Steyn, two players who have been out of the Bok set up for a long time, are the only options. There is also Jesse Kriel, who has failed to spark at centre or even fullback this season. This could mean problems for Coetzee s backline, especially since the team may not have the creative expertise of flyhalf Handre Pollard.Coetzee will also have to rely on new captain Warren Whiteley, as regular eighth-man Duane Vermeulen is out with an injury. We have a vision of selecting the best possible team. We watched Duane play and he won t be available this weekend. He picked up a shoulder injury. It is severe. We will take him for further scans. Damian de Allende has not recovered from a haematoma. Lionel Mapoe is racing against time. He will be in a controlled environment as he is coming back from a hamstring strain, Coetzee said. This will be a little disruption. But the available guys showed great attitude.-MMASEKEPE MATSEBANE
