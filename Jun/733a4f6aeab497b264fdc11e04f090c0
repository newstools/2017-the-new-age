Bizarre reports surrounding kwaito legend Arthur Mafokate s alleged physical abuse claims against his girlfriend and singer Cici continue to mount as officials, who are handling the case sing a different tune.The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) could not reveal the status of the singer s case as it is awaiting a detailed report from the police.NPA spokesperson Phindi Louw said: The last time we checked, police were supposed to hand over his docket to the NPA offices, when they have completed their investigations. We are still waiting for that docket. Meanwhile police have confirmed that Mafokate s case has been temporarily withdrawn as it is still under investigation. Should there be any developments the news will be communicated, police spokesperson Col Lungelo Dlamini said.The findings came just a day after Cici, real name Busisiwe Twala, posted picture of her injuries on Instagram with the #breakthesilence.However, Mafokate who is out on R500 bail, denied the abuse claims, saying: Yes she is my girlfriend and I have not and never beaten or abused her. Yesterday, the Minister of women in the Presidency, Susan Shabangu, urged the police to prioritise all incidents of abuse against women. This incident comes on the back of an outcry because of hundreds of cases, where women suffer physical and other forms of abuse mostly at the hands of the people they know and especially from people they are intimate with, the statement reads.Gender activist Lisa Vettten from the Wits Institute for Social and Economic Research said the fact that the case was temporarily withdrawn means that there is more to the story than meets the eye. The case has a chance of going back to court, whatever the hold up, we hope that justice will be served, Vetten said.NONTOKOZO GXUMISA
