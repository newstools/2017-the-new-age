PERHAPS this was the wake-up call the Proteas needed ahead of their ODI series decider against New Zealand at Eden Park on Saturday. The series is tied at 2-2 after New Zealand defeated South Africa by seven wickets yesterday in the fourth ODI.While the Proteas will be disappointed that they missed out on the opportunity to clinch the series, this is definitely a wake-up call that they need to fire on all cylinders at Eden Park. They have found it easy since last year when they cruised to series wins over Australia and Sri Lanka at home and complacency could have crept in yesterday.The Proteas bowlers did not have answers for New Zealand opener Martin Guptill who scored a match-winning unbeaten 180. Proteas captain AB de Villiers admitted that they didn t create enough opportunities to get him out. It was a fantastic innings by him (Guptill), De Villiers said. We needed to get him out, but we could not create enough opportunities to get him out. We struggled to string together partnerships with the ball and he was unstoppable. He hit the ball very cleanly and we have a few things we need to work out. It was tough at times, the way he was playing was difficult to set a field to, but we might have given him a few boundary balls as well but all in all credit to him. The Proteas ended their innings on 279/8 after winning the toss and electing to bat, with De Villiers top scoring with 72 not out. But they were let down by the bowlers as they conceded too many boundaries as New Zealand easily chased down the target. We didn t play our best cricket especially the second half. I wasn t completely happy with our skills and we ve been really bowling well in the rest of the series. We need to get our act together for the final game now. nevillek@thenewage.co.za-Neville Khoza
