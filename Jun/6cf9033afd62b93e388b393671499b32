Bitz Technologies t/a Abacus Advisory has a lucrative share in major contracts at the Treasury, an ANN7 investigation has found.Sources and documents in ANN7 s possession place the company s managing partner, Mohamed Cassim, as a consultant in the office of the former director-general, Lungisa Fuzile.It is from there, sources say, he was able to negotiate without, in many cases, a visible trail of competitive bidding processes for key contracts for the Treasury.An extensive list of questions sent to Cassim went unanswered at the time of publication. When contacted telephonically Cassim said he had no comment.The track record of one such lucrative contract was exposed in an internal audit into the project management office for the government s ambitious Integrated Financial Management Systems (IFMS) project.Bitz Technologies t/a Abacus Advisory managed to secure a contract of R39m against a quote of R28m.It is unclear how these apparent oversights happened but the role of Cassim in the department has been questioned by at least three sources in the department.Apart from the IFMS project the key contracts Cassim has negotiated include a contract with Bain and Company for SAA which is under the administration of the Treasury for R10.1m.The company was also involved in the setting up of the Treasury s Technical Advisory Centre (GTAC) in 2012.Abacus has an ongoing contract with the Treasury s budget reform process, a contract that it has been involved in for a number of years. It was renewed this year.It was the Treasury s advisor for the setting up of the South African Social Security Agency.It was insourced by the Treasury to put in place the financial management systems for the R9bn Jobs Fund.Abacus also had a contract with the Gauteng provincial treasury for reestablishing the provincial funding agency.The Abacus website says the company has contracts in multiple sectors of society, but an ANN7 search through various government departments and open tender processes was able to ascertain that most of these were with the government and more particularly with the Treasury. We were unable to establish the value of most of these contracts.Abacus bid through open processes with home affairs and won a contract for about R500000 for writing draft chapters of a business case to support the repositioning of home affairs .It also won an open tender with the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs for an institutional governance and functionality review of the Gauteng provincial disaster management centre .Sources say Cassim has links to former finance minister Pravin Gordhan and senior Treasury officials Kenneth Brown, Michael Sass and Linda Bodewig.In addition, we were able to trace the involvement of other senior officials of Abacus Advisory who worked for the national Treasury in the past.CECILIA RUSSELL
