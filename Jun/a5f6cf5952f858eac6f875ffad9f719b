Citing the confidentiality protection that the law gives taxpayers, the South African Revenue Service (Sars) has declined to answer a parliamentary question about Oakbay Investments.DA MP Alf Lees asked Finance Minister Malusi Gigaga about Oakbay s value added tax (VAT) affairs in a written question.Lees asked Gigaba whether any outstanding VAT refunds were due from Sars to Oakbay for each of the past three tax years. He also inquired whether any VAT refunds were paid to the company in 2017. In addition, Lees asked Gigaba whether any VAT refund to Oakbay was audited and whether the bank account in which the refund was paid was verified as belonging to the company.Gigaba replied that Sars was, in terms of the provisions of chapter six of the Tax Administration Act, bound to treat all taxpayers affairs as confidential and could not divulge any aspects pertaining to the affairs of any taxpayer. The commissioner can therefore not divulge any details relating to this matter, Gigaba said.Gigaba gave Lees a similar reply in response to questions on whether Oakbay had requested in the first week of this month that a VAT refund be deposited into a foreign bank account or an attorney s trust fund. If this was the case, Lees also inquired, who had authorised the payment?Sars, however, declined to comment because all taxpayers enjoyed the legal protection of confidentiality.DENNIS CRUYWAGENdennisc@thenewage.co.za
