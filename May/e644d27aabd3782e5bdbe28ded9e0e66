Master Plastics yesterday listed on the JSE s AltX board. The company listed in the containers and packaging sector through unbundling from Astrapak, which remains listed on the JSE s main board.Master Plastics represents a group of manufacturing operations and its business is focused on providing predominantly flexible packaging and knitted synthetic fabrics to the agricultural, retail and food market segments. The group is the sixth company to list on JSE s containers and packaging sector, which has a total market capitalisation of R20.5bn. Donna Nemer, the director of Capital Markets at the JSE, said the JSE launched AltX to create a platform to give smaller companies access to capital so they can expand and contribute to economic growth. However, in the case of Master Plastics, AltX has also allowed us to continue to respond to the needs of a bigger company, Astrapak, as at adapts its structure and core focus. We believe that listing can support Master Plastics in building awareness of its brand as well as access to funding to continue its independent growth journey, Nemer said.Manley Diedloff, CEO of Master Plastics, said that the company will look to establish and enhance its reputation as an organisation that operates in niche markets and generates aboveaverage returns to the benefit of all its stakeholders. We will use our culture of innovation and our advanced asset base to explore growth opportunities within our existing customer base and market segments and look for acquisition opportunities to give effect to both product and market diversification over time, Diedloff said.Master Plastics intends to migrate to JSE s main board as soon as possible. Since the launch of the AltX 14 years ago, 36 companies have used it as a spring board to migrate to the JSE s main board. There are 56 companies listed on the AltX and it has a total market capitalisation of R22.5bn.-THELMA NGOMA|thelman@thenewage.co.za
