Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said his future was &#8220;not sorted completely&#8221; on Thursday as he ducked another opportunity to make an announcement about what he intends to do.Wenger, Arsenal&#8217;s manager since 1996, has come under fire from fans after the club were humiliated by Bayern Munich in the Champions League and dropped out of the Premier League top four.The Frenchman said recently that he would make an announcement on his future &#8220;very soon&#8221;, but he did not divulge any new information when invited to do so at his weekly press conference.&#8221;Not today, but I&#8217;m very clear in my mind,&#8221; he told reporters at Arsenal&#8217;s London Colney training base when asked if there was any news on his future.&#8220;Do I stay two months or two years? My commitment will be exactly the same. The time I spent here doesn&#8217;t influence at all my attitude.&#8221;I&#8217;ve always been very clear in my mind, but I think it&#8217;s a subject that is not sorted completely out.&#8221;Wenger is reported to have been offered a new two-year contract by Arsenal.It is 13 years since Arsenal last won the league and their 10-2 aggregate defeat by Bayern condemned them to a seventh successive last 16 exit in the Champions League.The north London club are sixth in the Premier League table ahead of Sunday&#8217;s home game with Manchester City, having lost four of their last five games.But Wenger dismissed the suggestion that the uncertainty about his future was having a negative impact on his players.&#8220;No, I believe the priority in life is always to focus on what is important and not to look for excuses,&#8221; he said.&#8221;At the moment our results are not going the way they should, but we have to make sure the priority is what happens on the pitch.&#8221; &#8216;One team in London&#8217; Wenger also reacted to comments attributed to star forward Alexis Sanchez in the Chilean media.Sanchez, said to be a target for Premier League leaders Chelsea, is reported to have said he is &#8220;happy in London&#8221;, but wants to play for a team with a &#8220;winning mentality&#8221;.&#8220;There&#8217;s only one team in London, so he&#8217;s happy,&#8221; Wenger joked.&#8221;I think personally he&#8217;s happy here. It&#8217;s true we haven&#8217;t extended his contract yet. I hope he&#8217;ll stay at the club.&#8221;You always have to be cautious when people give interviews in their home countries because the interpretation is not always what they wanted to say.&#8220;But I don&#8217;t see anything negative. He said he wants to win the championship. That&#8217;s what everybody wants and I can understand that completely.&#8221;Both Sanchez and German playmaker Mesut Ozil are stalling over new contracts, but Wenger expressed confidence they will both elect to stay at the Emirates Stadium.&#8220;I personally believe that both of them want to stay and hope the club finds an agreement with them,&#8221; he said.Wenger said Ozil was in line to make his first league appearance since February 11 against City following illness and a hamstring injury.But Spanish midfielder Santi Cazorla is not expected to feature again this season due to an Achilles problem.&#8221;I think the season is over for him,&#8221; Wenger said.-AFP
