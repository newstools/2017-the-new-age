THERE must have been more than a billion reasons for losses since the game of rugby was first played and Bulls captain Handre Pollard does not want to add to the statistics.What Pollard, who is back from a long term injury wants for his team is to use the next match to prove that their two Super Rugby losses to the Stormers and Cheetahs were not because of a lack of effort.The 23-year-old flyhalf said his team will have to be clinical when they face the Sunwolves. To do this, the Bulls captain said his team will have to reduce their error rate against an improving Sunwolves side that pushed the Cheetahs to the limit last weekend. I do not think it is a question of effort. We were just not clinical enough. We made too many too many mistakes. If you are going to make over 30 mistakes against the Cheetahs, they will punish you. But we cannot limit ourselves and stop expressing ourselves.We just have to reduce the error rate while playing good rugby, Pollard said. The talented pivot said he was not only unhappy about his team s unconvincing performances but also his own in the two previous losses. The biggest thing of Pollard right now is to regain his form, earn the Bulls their first victory at Loftus Versfeld and also go on tour next week on the back of a good result. I have high standards for myself. I push myself to be at my best, to do better. I could play better. I was not good enough against the Stormers. I improved a bit in the Cheetahs match. This is a great opportunity for myself personally to do better and for the team to get out of this position, Pollard said. We want to get a win before we go on tour and we want to make Loftus a fortress and bring fans back. The break helped us. We are raring to go. mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za-Mmasekepe Matsebane
