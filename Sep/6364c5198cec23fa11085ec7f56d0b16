Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela was not happy with his team after they were held to a 1-1 draw by 10 man Bidvest Wits in an Absa Premiership clash on Saturday evening at the FNB Stadium.Wits were dealt with a huge blow when defender Nazeer Allie was given his marching orders on the stroke of the half time for a second bookable offence. Chiefs took advantage of the situation in the second half and create numerous chances. Amakhosi eventually broke the deadlock in the 52nd minute through veteran Siphiwe Tshabalala.However, the Clever Boys put Chiefs under immersed pressure despite being one man down. The visitors dominance finally paid off in the last minutes of the added time when Egyptian striker Amr Gamal scored a long range strike into the bottom corner from the edge of the box.Chiefs coach Komphela couldn t hide his disappointment after the match. I am just disappointed by how we conceded looking at the clock as well,&#8221; said Komphela.&#8220;The threat was clear and just before that happened we stood up on the bench trying to give an indication of where the threat was, and the message could not just go to the players in time.&#8220;It&#8217;s a draw that we did not deserve. It should have been three points in the bag, said Komphela.Goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune echoed the sentiment of his coach, saying they could have defended their lead. I am not happy. I m very disappointed how we gave a way a goal in an added time, said Khune. It happened last season against Golden Arrows where we gave away silly goal in the dying minutes. We worked so hard to score a goal. Nine men we couldn t beat them. We need to go back and look at ourselves and say what is it that we could have done better, said disappointed Khune.Chiefs are currently sitting on eighth spot on the league log with five points from four games. The glamour Boys will be back in action on Wednesday when they take on Maritzburg United at the Harry Gwala Stadium.-Ntsako Mashaba
