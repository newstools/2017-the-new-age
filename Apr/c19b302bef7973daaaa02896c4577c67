A Limpopo pensioner is R39.5m richer today after winning the Lotto Plus jackpot on Saturday.And he only needed a mere R7.50 to scoop the millions.The still visibly shocked pensioner from a rural village and who prefers to remain anonymous, spoke to the media at in Polokwane yesterday in the company of his son and daughter.Asked by The New Age how he intended to spend his fortune, the father of five said: I will obviously see to it that my five children and my wife are covered. But as you know, the biggest thing for us rural people is agriculture.I have been dreaming of owning a tractor but now I will buy it and go plough the fields. He said should land become available he may consider buying a farm to practice large scale farming, where some people may find employment.But hitting a whopping R39.5m jackpot was not just a windfall for this former factory worker in Springs. He actually physically and mentally worked for his loot. I have been playing Lotto for quite some time and I always bet only one line. But every time the results come out I write the winning numbers down on a paper and then write my preferred ones next to the winning set and go and play. The pensioner became Limpopo s 16th Lotto millionaire.Ithuba spokesperson Zukiswa Nomnganga said: As with all big winners Ithuba provided the winner with financial advice, trauma and emotional counselling to prepare him and his family for his new life as a multimillionaire. He bet his number from a flash machine in his rural village where there are no big machines you get at the urban outlets. Limpopo seems to have a lucky streak. Ithuba s biggest ever Power Ball jackpot of R87m was also won by a player from the Limpopo region, Nomnganga said.MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
