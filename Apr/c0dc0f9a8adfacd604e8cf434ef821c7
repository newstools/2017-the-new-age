President Donald Trump wants to retool the fabled H-1B visas for skilled workers sought by Silicon Valley heavyweights, a White House official said Monday.There are, however, limits to the scope of his action in the absence of a broader legislative plan.These time-limited work permits meant for scientists, engineers and computer programmers are an important gateway for many Indians attracted by Silicon Valley.Trump on Tuesday will sign a decree while in Kenosha, Wisconsin, ordering the Labor, Justice and Homeland Security departments to propose reforms so that the H-1B program goes back to its roots.Its &#8220;original intent (was) awarding visas to the most skilled and highest paid applicants &#8212; crucially, at such time as these reforms are eventually implemented, it will prevent the program from being used to displace American workers,&#8221; a White House official said.&#8220;For too long, rather than just allowing the best to come (&#8230;), the H-1B program has been applied in a bad way for US workers,&#8221; the White House said. The executive order will aim to support stated Trump priorities of &#8220;buy American, hire American.&#8221;Immigration authorities already announced earlier in April measures to combat &#8220;fraud and abuse&#8221; in issuing the visas.The steps announced Monday come when the United States opens the annual allocation of some 85,000 H-1B visas.The US president cannot, by a simple decree, change the number of visas allocated.But the White House hopes, by signing the decree will build momentum before a possible legislative reform.&#8220;This is a transitional step to get towards a more skilled based and merit based version,&#8221; a White House official told AFP. &#8220;There is a lot we can do administratively, and the rest will be done hopefully legislatively.&#8221;The United States offers 85,000 H-1B visas every year, most of which are snapped up by Indian outsourcers whose employees fill a skill gap in US engineering. Applications are vastly oversubscribed and are allocated via a lottery system.-AFP
