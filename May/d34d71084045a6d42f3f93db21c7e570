Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba vowed that troubled airline South African Airways (SAA) could and would be turned around.Gigaba told the finance standing committee in Parliament yesterday that SAA s fleet, management, routes and aircraft maintenance would be looked at.He said he was looking forward to us resolving those issues. It s urgent for us to demonstrate our capacity to run that airline as it should be run .South Africa s nuclear programme however, Gigaba said, was a decision of the government. My job is to ensure that whatever decision is taken, whatever the volume of nuclear capacity that will be required, is implemented at a scale and pace that the economy and fiscus can take. We need to ensure that both the fiscus and economy are able to carry the investment required. On the fact that four companies controlled 96% of the auditing market, the minister said: It s something we need to address. We need to find a way to resolve it. We will engage with audit firms, the big four and others. I think it should be in the interest of business to support transformation. Gigaba said his department would ultimately have to make a decision on the so-called sugar tax. I think it s possible to make a decision both in the interest of health and the economy.
