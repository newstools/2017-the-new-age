The Life Esidimeni Family Committee will on Tuesday brief media on the progress made by the Department of Health (DoH), in moving all mentally ill patients who had been placed at unregistered NGOs.This comes after over 100 mentally ill patients died when they were being transferred from Life Esidimeni following the decision by the Gauteng department of health to terminate its long-running contract with the facility.Health Ombudsman Prof Malegapuru Makgoba, in his report highlighted negligence into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the mentally ill patients.The report found that former Gauteng health MEC Qedani Mahlangu and her former senior officials decision to relocate more than 1 000 psychiatric patients from Life Healthcare Esidimeni was reckless and negligent .In April, Gauteng Health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa announced that less than half of the patients who were moved have been transferred to suitable facilities .-TNA Reporter
