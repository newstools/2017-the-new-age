The battle lines for the ANC s next president are being drawn in the province.While President Jacob Zuma publicly endorsed his ex-wife and former African Union chairperson, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, to be the next leader of the ANC and the country in Bulwer on Sunday, South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) in KZN threw its weight behind Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa.Zuma said if South Africa wants to see change, it shouldn t look beyond Dlamini Zuma. Zuma was speaking at a welcoming ceremony for the former African Union chairperson at her home town of Bulwer in the KZN Midlands.The community and her local church had come together for a welcome back event.Zuma lauded her leadership skills and described her as an honest leader with integrity.The president said he hoped ANC members would make the right decision at the party s elective conference. Meanwhile, in Durban, Sanco KZN said Ramaphosa had in his tenure as the deputy president proved that he was fit to lead the ANC and run the country.Provincial secretary Richard Mkhungo said at a press briefing on Sunday that the ANC had done well in grooming and preparing Ramaphosa for the presidency of the ANC. We therefore still maintain the same confidence to Cyril Ramaphosa, who has proved undeniably throughout his term of office that he is fit and ready to ascend to the position of the president of the ANC and the country.We strongly believe that Senzo Mchunu is among the other potential leaders to serve in the top officials of the ANC NEC to revive a stronger ANC and a broader movement, Mkhungo said. Mchunu, a former KZN premier, was seen with Ramaphosa at the commemoration of the late prophet Isaiah Shembe in Richards Bay, Empangeni. It has been a historically embraced tradition in the ANC that a deputy president ascends to the position of the president and we believe this shall remain since it has assisted our movement in the past , Mkhungo said. We believe this is a view that will revive unity and cohesion, integrity and harmony among our mass liberation movement and the society at large. Standing firmly behind the ANC as the leader of the tripartite alliance, Sanco also called for party go into the conference unified. Warning against factionalism, Mkhungo said the previous local government elections on August 3 last year should be heeded as an indication of loss of trust and patience by the people of South Africa in the ANC.SIBONGISENI MAPHUMULOprovinces@thenewage.co.za
