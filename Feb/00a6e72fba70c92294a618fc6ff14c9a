The Gauteng traffic police compliance and enforcement unit has cracked down a syndicate of drivers licence fraudulent at a Randfontein testing station.The suspect own an unregistered driving school which he used for writing learner exams for students and also printing fake learners licences used to book for driving tests. The suspect was discovered by officers while sitting in a class for learners licence examination, writing the exam on behalf of one of his students.Both the learner and the driving school owner were arrested and detained at the Randfontein police station on charges of fraud. Busaphi Nxumalo, spokesperson for the Gauteng traffic police said that the person who was suppose to write the learners exam did not arrive so the first suspect wrote the exam for him. She said they did their own investigation and found that it was not the first time the suspect had done this. We took the learners licence to the department of transport for cancellation but it was only cancelled on January 31 and, surprisingly, during the arrest, an original learners licence was found on the suspect which means that it was reprinted and at this stage a booking for driving licence had been secured, Nxumalo said.The main suspect who owns an unregistered driving school was found in possession of a reprinted learners licence and a 164 document which can only be found on traffic officials.He was also found with an eNatis password belonging to an official, who is not yet known. Police will be investigating the matter further. Both suspects detained at the Randfontein SAPS are to appear in court.-Dikeledi Ramabopa|news@thenewage.co.za
