Boxing hall of famer Lennox Lewis won&#8217;t be spending his money on the Floyd Mayweather-Conor McGregor fight, saying he &#8220;can&#8217;t take it serious&#8221; because the outcome is too predictable.The former undisputed world heavyweight champion said the combination of Mayweather&#8217;s boxing experience and hand speed will be too much to handle for McGregor, who has made him name as a mixed martial arts fighter.&#8220;It&#8217;s ridiculous to me,&#8221; Lewis told US sports broadcaster ESPN. &#8220;You are talking about one discipline where you can use only your hands and only a few can do it.&#8221;Every battle sport always starts with your hands, but they are two totally different sports.&#8221;The fight is being held in the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas and promoters are hoping to make millions off the pay-per-view sales. Scheduled as a 12-round boxing match with 10 ounce gloves, three-time world heavyweight champion Lewis says it won&#8217;t go the distance.&#8220;I can&#8217;t take it serious,&#8221; Lewis said. &#8220;Mayweather is the best in his weight class, no one can touch him in boxing.&#8221;Floyd will stop him. He&#8217;s just too good at boxing for McGregor and McGregor is just too inexperienced.&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t buy it, but I would be interested in the result. To me, I know who is going to win already so there&#8217;s no use in watching it.&#8221;Lewis, who fought for Canada at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, joins a growing list of boxing purists who have come out against the much-discussed fight which will take place August 26.The 40-year-old Mayweather has been retired since beating Andre Berto in September 2015 and improving his career record to 49-0.The matchup with McGregor gives Mayweather a chance to reach the 50-0 career milestone.Former champ Oscar De La Hoya and promoter Kathy Duva have also slammed the event as an exhibition spectacle, pointing to the fact that the 28-year-old McGregor has never had a professional boxing match and only dabbled in the sport as a teenager.But unlike those two, Lewis doesn&#8217;t feel the novelty matchup will hurt boxing&#8217;s image.&#8221;I don&#8217;t believe it would damage boxing &#8230;. I love Bruce Lee and the other disciplines and when he fought against other fighters, you wanted to see the differences, so I can see the appeal,&#8221; Lewis said.Mayweather-McGregor have yet to get together face-to-face since the announcement but they are expected to announce a promotional tour that will take them to a couple of major US cities.-AFP
