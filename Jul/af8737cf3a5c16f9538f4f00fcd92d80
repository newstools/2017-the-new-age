Recently the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) held its central committee meeting, bringing together 700 regional leaders and shop stewards, who are the first point of contact for union members on the ground.To add to that figure, more than 150 international and local guests witnessed the vibrancy that characterised this 35-year-old union.For the so-called labour reporters who have started a choir to sing different burial hymns for the NUM are being totally mischievous. For them to argue that it is in trouble and that there is no hope in sight demonstrates poor judgement event from their side.It is a reality that in the midst of many challenges the union has faced since 2012, it is regaining lost members on a daily basis in the mining, construction and energy sectors.It has already launched three branches in mining operations at Impala, Lonmin and Sibanye, formerly Anglo American Platinum.The NUM has never shied away from admitting its mistakes.It is true it learnt the hard way from its experiences of 2012.On many occasions it admitted that some of its branch leaders disregarded the interests of members on the ground.The recent central committee, the highest decision-making body held between national congresses, reflected much on worker-related issues and economic dynamics impacting negatively on workers wellbeing.Service delivery to workers was thoroughly discussed.For some reasons, labour reporters ignore the fact the union was and is faced with challenges of retrenchment in the mining industry.There is realisation that employers are using a new vicious tendency of retrenching workers using incapacitation. The union continues to make its presence felt in the three industries against all odds. This despite the massive losses that occurred in 2012 and thereafter.The gold mining industry is in a declining mode. As a result, mining companies prefer to invest in some mines by going even deeper.The mining, construction and energy sectors, in which the NUM organises, are in turmoil due to continuing economic pressures as the country s growth and investment outlook remains poor.Since 2015 s 14th national congress, there s been growth in every sector but the weak economic situation has reduced efforts whereby more than 50 000 workers were retrenched between 2012 and 2015, and more than 12 000 shed between the fourth quarter of 2015 and that of 2016 in mining and quarrying.Nevertheless, the NUM is resolute it can still achieve the target of 216 854 members which would mean an increase of 12.75% between 2016 and 2017.It is wrong to assume that the union has lost its militancy on the shop floor.The NUM has a strong and militant base and after the wave of the 2012 mass exodus, has crafted a recruitment and retention strategies aimed at strengthening a system of membership, a strategy for recruitment and a plan for keeping members involved and active.Recruitments are progressing very well, despite incidents of intimidation.Confronting these challenges honestly is not about protecting and defending the NUM for its own sake.It is about doing what it is supposed to be done and doing it better. It is about identifying the union s weaknesses and collectively finding ways to resolve them.The union will be celebrating 35 years of existence in December, a considerable number of years for an organisation that faced upheavals that threatened its existence under the apartheid government.Luphert ChilwaneLuphert Chilwane is a media officer at the NUM in Johannesburg
