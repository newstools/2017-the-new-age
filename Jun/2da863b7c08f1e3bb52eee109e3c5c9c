THE much anticipated urgent application by Brian Molefe in the Labour Court was not heard yesterday and it is not clear when the matter will be heard.The DA, however, said that its application to review Molefe s reappointment would proceed, even if Molefe s urgent application succeeds.The party s James Selfe said an order would be taken in the North Gauteng High Court today, by agreement, that Molefe would not attend work at the Eskom head office or at any of its sites, for the purpose of performing any duties, subject to the completion of his Labour Court matter, where after the DA s review application, would be set down for hearing. We intend to intervene in the Labour Court proceedings at once. His urgent court action is nothing more than desperation, Selfe said. Eskom board spokesperson Khulani Qoma said he was not sure when the matter would be heard in court. Lawyers are still compiling responding affidavits and once they are done it will be communicated when the matter will be in court, Qoma said.The Labour Court registrar also confirmed that no papers were filed as the matter was not on the roll. Molefe said on Sunday that he was hauling both Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown and the Eskom board to court to challenge his removal as Eskom CEO.On Friday, Eskom announced that Molefe was no longer the group chief executive and would also no longer serve as a director on Eskom s board.NONDUMISO ZWANE
