The Pietermaritzburg Regional Court will look into the case against eight students charged with taking part in violent Fees Must Fall (FMF) protests in 2016.This comes after the state lost a bid to have a ruling granting bail to three of the accused, overturned.Two of the students have told the court that they were not part of violent protests at a University of KwaZulu-Natal residence on the Pietermaritzburg campus in October 2016.The case has now been adjourned to February 16 so prosecutors at the Regional Court can assess whether the police investigation has been completed and when the case will be transferred from the lower court.Prosecutors at the Pietermaritzburg Regional Court will now go over the docket against eight University of KwaZulu-Natal students accused of pelting the police with objects and setting a building alight on the night of October 1 during protracted Fees Must Fall protests.This comes after the Magistrate s Court gave the state a deadline to obtain all the sworn statements from the police.The issue was not raised again when Spetho Mazibuko, Sphelele Mtshali and Sanele Sibiya stood in the dock in their latest court appearance.During the bail hearing, Mazibuko told the court that he and Mtshali were walking to a shop to buy food at 10 that night after the protests were brought under control, when they were arrested.He says they were not part of the group of students who threw stones, bottles and roof tiles at the police at a university residence.The eight are also being charged with setting a building alight and violating an interdict against student protests on campus.During the bail application, the police simply said Mazibuko, Mtshali and Sibiya were identified and arrested in the process of quelling the protest.The three were granted R1000 bail each.
