This story by numbers is stark. 94 mentally ill patients died between last March and December 27. NGOs to which patients were transferred operated under invalid licences.All 94, yes let s repeat this number, 94 patients died under unlawful circumstances. And 20 died at the most inappropriately named Precious Angels NGO.A total of 25 died at CCRC-SiyabadingaAnchor. None of these stats, however, tell the true story of the suffering and neglect that vulnerable mental patients experienced when moved from Life Esidimeni to unregistered NGOs last year.That story can only be told by the families of those who died because of gross neglect by the authorities when they hurriedly moved the patients from a patient facility which cost the government R320 a patient a day at Life Esidimeni.Marie Collitz s interview with health ombudsman Prof Malegapuru Makgoba s researchers documents the fear, bewilderment and tragic end of 61-year-old patient Freddie Collitz.Marie spoke of the neglect and care and how on the day she last saw him on the day he died he had a wound to the head, blisters around his ankles and a sore on his nose. She believes he was dehydrated.The family were never allowed into the home, but when her son made his way inside one day he found that there were no sheets, pillows or blankets on their beds.The starkest example of the dehumanisation of this patient came from his son Riaan who explained the home would not allow them to bring Freddie s clothes. Every time he had big clothes on and his pants were always tied with shoelaces, Riaan said.The family was told, when they phoned to check on him, that he was sleeping at 5.30pm when he had died half an hour before.The ombudsman talks of chaotic decision making, lack of planning and accountability.It also speaks of failure to protect patients in terms of their constitutional rights and those protected by mental health legislation. Former health MEC Qedani Mahlangu s interview with the ombudsman is clear that she had no doubt that her plan would work &#8211; even though she knew that none of the NGOs were registered. Asked when looking back if she thinks it was a good decision, the MEC gave an account that when a policy decision is taken you don t know how it will unfold and what is going to happen, the report said.More terrifying is that in her resignation letter she is unapologetic relieved that the Ombudsman did not find her culpable, determined that the de-institutionalisation plan was within best practice for mental healthcare internationally.She is less than candid when she tells that she takes credit for asking the ombudsman to look into the deaths: it was the families and civil society that had already raised a ruckus and she was forced into making this decision.Perhaps this is a story too close to me to ignore and not get angry about. I have lived in the shadow of mental illness for much of my life and know its devastation on a family. But I also know with the right care it can be managed.I also have looked after a mother in her frail last days and know the vulnerability of families as they hand their precious kin to institutional care knowing but not always acknowledging the potential for neglect and abuse.As I have followed this story I have felt there but for the grace of God go I .For the vulnerable no guns are needed neglect, lack of care, bad planning and haste is all that is needed to kill.Cecilia RussellCecilia Russell is editor for special projects at ANN7
