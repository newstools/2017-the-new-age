Roger de Sa s resignation from Maritzburg United has not only come as a bombshell to the KwaZulu-Natal side, it has also fuelled speculation he could be headed to the national team.De Sa, who joined The Team of Choice on a six months contract three months ago, replacing Ernst Middendorp, resigned yesterday morning. Maritzburg chairperson Farouk Kadodia said the former Bidvest Wits and Pirates coach left for family reasons . But some of the players at the team tell a different story.According to one of the team s stars, De Sa did not even bother to say goodbye. It is rumoured that the coach who took Pirates to the final of the CAF Champions League, losing out to Al Ahly, will be named as Bafana Bafana assistant coach in the event that Portuguese coach Carlos Queiroz is named head coach of the national team. He didn t even come to training on Wednesday even though management said he would Look, the word in the corridors is that there are no family issues. A new Bafana coach is expected to be announced and I think he is going there. It looks like Maritzburg were going to give him problems had Bafana asked for him through the club. Carlos Queiroz will be the new coach of Bafana and since he and Roger are close, I think he ll make him his deputy as Roger knows local football and he has a great relationship with Queiroz, the source said. The likelihood of such is high ,considering what Safa head Danny Jordaan said when he was in Zambia: that the new coach will be in SA to watch, when Bafana play Guinea-Bissau and Angola in friendly matches.-Mmasekepe Matsebane|mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
