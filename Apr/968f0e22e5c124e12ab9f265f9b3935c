Funding for early-stage start-ups is notoriously hard to find as not many financiers are prepared to invest, given the inherent high risks involved in backing a business with no proven track record.This, coupled with statistics revealing that one in five start-ups fail within the first five years, makes it even more of a challenge for a first-time entrepreneur to convince a financier to approve funding. Christo Botes, executive director at Business Partners Limited, said while a concise business plan is often the deciding factor for a financier when approving business finance applications, more established entrepreneurs have the added benefit of industry and work experience that a start-up entrepreneur may not possess. When considering whether or not to grant funding for their start-up venture, this decision is often based solely on the business plan and the research put into this, thereby highlighting the importance of this document, Botes said. He said start-up entrepreneurs Chelsea Evans and Jason Newmark were proof of how the strength of a business plan can impact a financier s decision of whether to grant funding. Recent participants in the venturecapital television show, Shark Tank SA, the duo have managed to raise R400000 based purely on the business plan for their internet start-up business, PlanMyWedding.com a complete project-management tool that allows couples to get quotes from service providers, draw up a budget and manage an interactive gift registry, among many other functions involved in planning a wedding is still in the development stage.During the episode, recently aired on M-Net, the start-up entrepreneurs pitched their business concept and succeeded in convincing two of the sharks to invest R200000 each, in return for 25% each in the business. Newmark said while it may seem a stroke a luck, their success on Shark Tank SA is testament to the strength of their business concept based on many years of hard work and research, as well as actively networking and seeking business support.In September 2015, Evans and Newmark attended a day-long businessplanning workshop in Cape Town as part of their SME Toolkit/ Business/ Partners business plan competition for young aspiring entrepreneurs, geared at enabling hundreds of young entrepreneurs from across the country with the tools required for starting a business. Evans said the workshop put them through several business-planning exercises, after which they had to present their plan to the group of about 30 fellow participants. It was especially helpful for refining our financial plan. Late last year, when they stumbled upon an advertisement calling on entrepreneurs to apply to appear on Shark Tank SA, their concept was developed as far as it could be without funding, so they decided to take the leap to enter the show. They were shortlisted before being notified they d been chosen for the programme, but then received another notification that it had been cancelled.Finally, Evans and Newmark received a call to say they could participate after all, but that they only had a few hours to catch a flight to Johannesburg. With little time to rehearse their pitch, the entrepreneurs attribute all the hard work on their business concept to what prepared them for the grilling on Shark Tank SA, and subsequently what secured them the funding.Apart from securing funding which is being used for the continuous refinement of their website Newmark said another invaluable advantage of having outside investors is the new energy and momentum that has been injected into the venture. Botes said while financiers are cautious to fund start-ups, a wellresearched business concept, backed by a solid business plan, is crucial for minimising doubt in the eyes of potential investors. An investor needs to be reassured that the entrepreneur behind the startup concept has the skills and resources to take a specific business idea and turn it into a successful start-up business that has the potential for growth. We encourage all entrepreneurs who are considering starting a new business to use the resources at their disposable. For instance, the SME Toolkit website http://southafrica.smetoolkit.org/sa/ en has various comprehensive guides on how to start and build a successful business, Botes said.-SELLO RABOTHATA|sellor@thenewage.co.za
