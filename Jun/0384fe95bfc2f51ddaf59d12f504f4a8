The social network has announced major changes to its interface on twitter.com, iOS, Android, TweetDeck and Twitter Lite, rolling out from Thursday, June 15 and in the coming days.Twitter has taken onboard user comments and feedback in a bid to refresh its interface with aesthetic and ergonomic changes to help make the social network easier to use.&#8220;Today, with lots of feedback and ideas from you, we&#8217;re refreshing our product too and making it feel lighter, faster, and easier to use. We listened closely and kept what you love.And for the things you didn&#8217;t, we took a new approach to fix and make better,&#8221; said the social network in a blog post.First of all, tabs are being streamlined into a side menu. After being tested on Android last year, the new navigation menu for access to profile, accounts, settings and privacy will roll out to iOS.Still for iOS, links will no longer automatically open in the Twitter reader. Now links to articles or websites that the user clicks on can be opened in Safari&#8217;s viewer in the Twitter app, if the relevant option is selected in settings.In terms of design tweaks, Twitter is aiming to simplify. To help users follow tweets and discussions, the social network has refined its typography &#8220;to make it more consistent,&#8221; and has made headlines bolder &#8220;to make it easier to focus on what&#8217;s happening. Also, rounded profile photos make it clearer to see what&#8217;s being said and who&#8217;s saying it.&#8221;Finally, new intuitive icons have been designed and additional accessibility options are available, such as increased color contrast.The updates will roll out from June 15 across Twitter&#8217;s various platforms.-AFP
