They may have proved to be the best team in South Africa and on the continent, but Mamelodi Sundowns are facing a tough period in which they have to show their appetite for even more trophies.The Brazilians welcome Golden Arrows in a Nedbank Cup last 16 encounter at the Lucas Moripe Stadium off the back of some horrible league form. Pitso Mosimane s men have not won any of their last five PSL matches, having lost twice and drawn three times, collecting three points out of a possible 15 that would have perched them at the top of the log.The hope at the moment, despite Mosimane s worry that Arrows will sit back and defend on the day, is that Sundowns will triumph tomorrow and gain renewed confidence in the league. Sundowns and Bafana Bafana midfielder Themba Zwane has challenged his teammates, as Pitso has done, to stop being wasteful with the countless chances they create in matches. It is tough to deal with it, but we have been in this situation before. The biggest problem is that we do not take our chances that we create, Zwane said. Facing Arrows will be tough. We need to win as that will be good for our low confidence. This will be Sundowns toughest opponent in the competition this season after they easily disposed of Mariveni United of Limpopo in the previous round.Last season, Sundowns failed to defend the Nedbank Cup trophy, losing to Orlando Pirates in a tense semifinal in Atteridgeville. Clinton Larsen s Arrows have not done well against Sundowns in nine previous meetings in all competitions, with the side from KwaZulu-Natal only winning twice and drawing twice.-Mmasekepe Matsebane|mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
