Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said he yet to see &#8220;anything concrete&#8221; from U.S. President Donald Trump over his vow to defeat Islamic State and called U.S. forces deployed in Syria &#8220;invaders&#8221; because they were there without government permission.Assad, in an interview with Chinese TV station Phoenix, said &#8220;in theory&#8221; he still saw scope for cooperation with Trump though practically nothing had happened in this regard.Assad said Trump&#8217;s campaign pledge to prioritise the defeat of Islamic State had been &#8220;a promising approach&#8221; but added: &#8220;We haven&#8217;t seen anything concrete yet regarding this rhetoric.&#8221;Assad dismissed the U.S.-backed military campaign against Islamic State in Syria as &#8220;only a few raids&#8221; he said had been conducted locally. &#8220;We have hopes that this administration &#8230; is going to implement what we have heard,&#8221; he added.Asked about a deployment of U.S. forces near the northern city of Manbij, Assad said: &#8220;Any foreign troops coming to Syria without our invitation &#8230; are invaders.&#8221;&#8220;We don&#8217;t think this is going to help&#8221;.-Reuters
