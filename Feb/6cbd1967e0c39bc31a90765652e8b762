The National Union of mine workers (NUM) has on Thursday expressed sadness regarding Gold Mine s intention of retrenching its workers in Mpumalanga. NUM is saddened by Evander Gold Mine&#8217;s intention to retrench 2 000 mine workers in Mpumalanga, said NUM.The union said the mine s reason for retrenching employees was due to high operating costs, a low gold price and ageing of infrastructure.In 2015, the United Kingdom (UK) based company Lonmin also announced that it will cut down on production to survive the slump in platinum prices. The move resulted in reducing production and translated in job losses.However, NUM vowed to wage a war against mine companies imposing voluntary packages to employees. NUM declares war against job losses through retrenchments, Voluntary Severance Package and other untoward concocted means that are destroying the lives of many families with dependents in labour-sending areas, said NUM.Furthermore the union said it is concerned that the mining companies issues Section 189 of the Labour Relations Act, of which they do not align with Section 52 of MPRDA 2002.Evander Gold Mine declined to comment.-Sipho Jack
