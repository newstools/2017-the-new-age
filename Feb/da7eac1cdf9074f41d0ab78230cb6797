In December 2010 the Mpumalanga department of health gave 12 key outcomes for its programme of action from 2010 to 2014.One of them was decreasing maternal and child mortality. The province said this would be possible if a bigger budget was allocated to the cause. There is no dedicated budget for infant mortality. The youth and child health unit had R991000 for salaries and R130000 for goods and services, department spokesperson Dumisani Malamule said.He said financial constraints had crip pled the ability to conduct workshops for health workers, the burden of diseases, a skills shortage and the delays of recognition by community members of the signs and seek health care are some of the barriers in the reduction of infant fatalities.The department, according to Malamule in spite of an inadequate budget to tackle the problem, there are plans in place for fighting the scourge. He said the department is empowering parents and caregivers through health education and practical demonstrations in public health care facilities and in various communities on the links between an unhealthy environment and disease transmission.Other initiatives include the establishment of support groups to capacitate mothers and guardians on 16 key household practices in four categories (growth promotion and development and interpreting a child s Road to Health booklet, disease prevention, Home management and care seeking and compliance to treatment and advice) that will have the greatest impact on child survival.Finally he said during health promotion interventions children are screened for malnutrition and if found to be moderate or severe they are admitted to public health facilities. Witbank has the highest number of deaths due to the fact that it is one of the two tertiary and a referral hospital for the province. Sabie and Waterval Boven Hospitals have the lowest infant deaths as they are smaller district hospitals with fewer admissions, Malamule said.As a solution the department suggested a wider use of media as a tool to communicate educational information to improve community awareness on infant health issues, a dedicated budget for the provincial office, skilled and experienced staff at public health facilities, the need for basic equipment as well as dedicated officials for child health only for the provision of technical support and monitoring of services in facilities.This it asserts is especially critical in rural areas.A year ago in February the DA highlighted one of the pitfalls that Malamule highlighted which is staffing. In a statement it said the Health Department in a quarterly report indicated that mortality rate in Mpumalanga had increased from 77.5/100000 deaths in the 2nd quarter of the 2014-15 financial year to 135.3/100000 deaths in 2015-16. The report attributes this tragic increase to inadequate access to health facilities and goes on to state that due to a shortage of staff only 77% of live births could be attended to by skilled health personnel. The increase in the infant mortality rate has also been attributed to a shortage of skilled health professionals such as pediatricians, the statement read.This however is not the only reason for infant mortality not only in Mpumalanga but also in the entire country, according to the South African Medical journal in a article published 2016.In a Child Death Review (CDR) pilot titled Child deaths in South Africa: Lessons from the child death review pilot it was shown that there was a pattern in child mortality which it identified as infanticide in the neonatal period, acquired natural causes in particular lower respiratory tract infection LRTI: Lower respiratory tract infection during infancy, child abuse and neglect-related deaths in children aged five years, road traffic deaths, in particular deaths of pedestrians, as children become older the article said.It further found that the neonatal period is the period that posses the greatest risk, particular for premature infants. We show that premature infants are at increased risk of dying from LRTIs during the post-neonatal period once they have been discharged home, especially during winter, the article said.Importantly as Malamule had mentioned the paper also chalks social circumstances as part of the findings in the mortality of infants.They claimed that poor living conditions along with limited support for mothers and inferior quality of community based services make it easier for pre term infants to die from preventable infections like LRTIs.The process undertaken by the CDR investigation also made it clear that there is a need to not only look at the medical processes, but social and behavioural influences have to be considered.Hloni Mashigoprovinces@thenewage.co.za
