Stephen McGown s family said his mother, Beverly, died of a broken heart after spending more than six years waiting in vain for her kidnapped son s safe return.McGown s 69-year-old mother died on Saturday evening after being ill for some time.McGown has been in captivity in northern Mali for more than six years after being abducted by militant Islamist group al-Qaeda.His father, Malcolm, said that being separated from their son and worrying about his condition for so long had taken a heavy toll on his wife s health. She was hoping that Stephen would be home by now. We tried to tell her to hang on until he was back but sadly she passed away. We don t have words to express our loss. The fact that Stephen has been away for so many years affected her health immensely. The stress that she had to deal with over the last six years was tremendous on her, it amplified everything, Malcolm said.He said that he would continue looking for his captured son, adding that other avenues of getting him back would be explored now that negotiations through a non-government organisation had collapsed . I will continue on my quest of ensuring that Stephen is back. Last week, Gift of the Givers announced that efforts to negotiate for the release of McGown and Swedish national Johan Gustafsson had reached a deadlock because of the huge ransom demands by their captors.The kidnappers are demanding just more than 8m (R116m).The last time proof of life was presented to the families was in December 2015.A video released then showed McGown and Gustafsson wearing traditional clothes and sitting under a tree while three men watched them closely.Malcolm said a date for his wife s funeral was still being finalised.He described his life partner of nearly 50 years as a loving wife .Two other South Africans are also being held in foreign countries, one in Syria and another in South Sudan.ZODIDI MHLANAzodidim@thenewage.co.za
