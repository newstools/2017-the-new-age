Business confidence in South Africa is slowly gaining momentum as it rose to 97.7 in January, picking further up from a positive 94 index points in December 2016, suggesting that local companies are somewhat optimistic about the domestic environment.This is likely to convince potential investors to open their purses to expand their businesses further and, as a result, creating much needed jobs. The private sector is believed to be sitting on an estimated cash of R700bn.According to the South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Sacci) survey, a rise in confidence in January was helped by higher commodity prices and an increase in new vehicle sales.The chamber said it expected conditions that could boost business confidence and attract investment and economic growth in the months ahead.One of the key factors which lifted confidence is the fact that the country is recovering from its worst drought in history which wilted crops and stoked food inflation.Further, expected slower inflation will help the economy this year along with higher commodity prices.However, worries about low investment rates and the political environment continue to weigh.In addition, the latest survey is not only in severe contrast to the severe year on year decline of December 2015 of 10 index points, but it is the second consecutive month improving on the year earlier. January saw the largest positive month on month change in the confidence index of 3.9 index points since the month-on-month change of 4.1 index points in February 2015. It was also the biggest positive year-on-year difference since the 5.3 index points of May 2011. The recovery of the BCI in October, November and December 2016 and the acceleration in January indicate a normalisation of the business climate in South Africa despite uncertain local and global economic and political conditions, the chamber said.Apart from the rand exchange rate, the increased real value of building plans passed, the higher gold and platinum price, and a larger number of new vehicle sales, also contributed to the BCI in January. Sacci said if these conditions could continue to carry the day, then the momentum gained in business confidence could accelerate and create the necessary investment and economic growth atmosphere. It is further imperative that South Africa stays abreast and adopt to international and global changes that stand to impact on South Africa, global trade conditions, the local economy and the business community, Sacci said.-Bernard Sathekge
