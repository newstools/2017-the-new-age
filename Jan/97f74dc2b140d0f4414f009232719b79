U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Monday apologized to hundreds of State Department employees who were fired after the start of the Cold War for being gay in what is known as the &#8220;lavender scare.&#8221;&#8220;In the past &#8211; as far back as the 1940s, but continuing for decades &#8211; the Department of State was among many public and private employers that discriminated against employees and job applicants on the basis of perceived sexual orientation, forcing some employees to resign or refusing to hire certain applicants in the first place,&#8221; Kerry said in a statement. &#8220;These actions were wrong then, just as they would be wrong today.&#8221;He added: &#8220;On behalf of the Department, I apologize to those who were impacted by the practices of the past and reaffirm the Department&#8217;s steadfast commitment to diversity and inclusion for all our employees, including members of the LGBTI community.&#8221;U.S. Senator Ben Cardin, the leading Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from Maryland, wrote Kerry in November referring to the time as a &#8220;deep stain on our national history and that of the State Department.&#8221;Cardin told Kerry he intended to &#8220;remedy this injustice&#8221; by introducing legislation to acknowledge the &#8220;lavender scare&#8221; years and offer an apology on behalf of Congress.-ReutersCanada&#8217;s PM to shuffle Cabinet, set to drop foreign minister (Recasts; adds source saying foreign minister set to be dropped)By David LjunggrenOTTAWA, Jan 9 (Reuters) &#8211; Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will shuffle his Cabinet this week and is set to move Foreign Minister Stephane Dion, who ran into political trouble last year, a person with knowledge of the matter said on Monday.&#8220;Dion is out,&#8221; said the person, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.The Canadian Press, which initially broke the story, said the move was scheduled for Tuesday and would involve at least six people.The shuffle would be the first time Trudeau has made major changes since his Liberals took power in November 2015, allowing him to recast his Cabinet ahead of Donald Trump&#8217;s inauguration as U.S. President.Relations with the United States will be crucial over the next four years and Trudeau may have decided he needs a better communicator than Dion, a French-speaker and former professor who sometimes stumbles when speaking English.Trump&#8217;s vow during the campaign to either tear up or renegotiate NAFTA could have calamitous consequences for Canada, which sends 75 percent of its exports to the United States.One leading candidate to replace Dion would be Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland, an author and former reporter who worked for several years in the United States and has good connections in Washington.Such an appointment would be complicated as Trudeau wants to improve ties with Russia, which banned Freeland &#8211; who is of Ukrainian descent &#8211; in the wake of Russia&#8217;s annexation of Crimea in 2014.Freeland, who is sometimes pictured in Ukrainian national dress, has been harshly critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin.Trudeau and Dion&#8217;s offices declined to comment. Freeland&#8217;s office did not respond to requests for comment.Dion, 61, a former Liberal leader who held ministerial posts in previous governments from 1996 to 2006, was widely criticized last June for not defending a reporter when China&#8217;s foreign minister berated her at a news conference.He also came under fire for the government&#8217;s handling of a controversial arms deal with Saudi Arabia.-AFP
