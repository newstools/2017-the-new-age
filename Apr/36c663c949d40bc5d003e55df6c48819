Her surprised reply stating that she didn t understand the question. And when the reporter asked her if her parents were white, she walked away.Many took to Twitter to express themselves about her visit to South Africa.So Bruce Jenner, can transcend gender and assume struggles of women but Rachel Dolezal cannot transcend race and assume black struggles? #F1_2017 (@daz_inc_) April 6, 2017Rachel Dolezal is coming to South Africa to talk about race and racial identity. This is not going to end well. Sheesh. pic.twitter.com/vdRSBiySfO Phil Tomlinson (@philatom) April 6, 2017Seeing SJWs, who are gender and race-pimps themselves, now lose their minds over Rachel Dolezal for coming to SA, has really left me like&#8230; pic.twitter.com/OpJWsiDtHn Big Daddy Liberty (@SihleDLK) April 6, 2017Rachel Dolezal is apparently coming to South Africa. pic.twitter.com/bxSOsC8jjX Jua &#8211; Baby Bunny (@JuavanZyl) April 6, 2017I really hope that Rachel Dolezal talk on &#8220;non racialism&#8221; is fake news. We&#8217;re going through enough as a cowntry pic.twitter.com/V5PCzbCaIs Gugulethu Mhlungu (@GugsM) April 6, 2017Can&#8217;t believe they&#8217;re bringing Rachel Dolezal to this country a woman who believes she is just oppressed as a trans person pic.twitter.com/fksgP6RJjh Cheri (@cheritheunicorn) April 6, 2017-TNA Reporter
