Treatment Action Campaign has welcomed the launch of the Delamanid clinical access research programme, saying the programme was encouraging.This is after Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi launched the programme on Friday during World TB Day in a bid to curb the growing number of MDR-TB (multi-drug resistant TB).Delamanid is a new drug by Japanese pharmaceutical company Otsuka used for the treatment of MDR-TB. We welcome the trial and the efforts the department has made. We encourage it and we are looking at the drug being registered and being made available not only in South Africa but the rest of the world, TAC general secretary Anele Yawa said.Yawa cautioned against the impression created that the drug was available for use by anybody saying it s only available to a limited number of people as part of the research into the drug. We understand and respect the processes that have to be followed in order for the drug to be registered, he said.Motsoaledi said the drug will be initially made available to 200 patients in Gauteng, KZN, North West and Western Cape as part of the project.Meanwhile Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has expressed concern over what it calls extremely limited access to shorter, more tolerable treatment regimens for DR-TB patients in South Africa.According to MSF South Africa has one of the largest patient cohorts in the world on Delamanid, the organisation however estimates that the number of patients currently on Delamanid represents approximately 1% of the total number of patients in the country that would benefit from access to the drug.The programme comes as South Africa continues to wage a fight against its high burden of TB.This as late diagnosis, poor infection control and lack of adherence to treatment have been counted among factors fuelling resistance to TB drugs.The minster said in his speech that not only was drug resistant TB (DR-TB) difficult to treat, it was also expensive.The department estimates that while it costs about R400 to treat a TB patient, the cost multiplies 1000 times for MDR-TB and 2000 times for XDR-TB.South Africa is ranked among countries with the highest burden of TB and DR-TB in the world.The World Health Organisation s 2016 TB report said there was an estimated 480000 new cases of multi-drug resistant TB with an additional 100000 people with rifampicin-resistant TB who were eligible for MDR-TB in 2015.LERATO DIALEleratod@thenewage.co.za
