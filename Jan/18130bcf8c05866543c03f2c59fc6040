The ANC has castigated the mayor of Tshwane Solly Msimang s visit to Taiwan, saying the trip was in violation of the existing government s diplomatic policy over China.Party spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said that the visit contradicted South Africa s stance on the One China policy. He called on the International Relations and Cooperation Department (Dirco) to confiscate diplomatic passports from officials not following the foreign policy. The ANC therefore calls on Dirco urgently to confiscate all official and diplomatic passports from officials who are found to be wilfully undermining our foreign policy and to remind all government departments and parastatals of our foreign policy and the centrality of the Presidency. Msimang recently visited Taiwain after being invited to meet the mayor of the nation s capital, Taipei, to explore business opportunities.Kodwa said that the trip showed that the DA was trying to run a parallel government and not respecting South Africa s Constitution. The ANC s primary concern is that the DA is clearly intent on running a parallel government with its own foreign policy to the detriment of the existing government s policy, the country s international image and her national security, he said.He said that South Africa was not the only country to de-recognise Taiwan. The US only has relations with China.Msimang s office previously explained that Msimang s visit to Asia was in his personal capacity.He had said that it would be at no cost to the city despite what the ANC government wishes to purport to the people of Tshwane and South Africa alike . 701233TNA Reporter
