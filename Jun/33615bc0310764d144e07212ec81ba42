DA LEADER Mmusi Maimane s handling of Helen Zille s utterances on colonialism laid bare an epic power struggle between the two for the heart and soul of the official opposition party, former DA leader Tony Leon said this week.In an interview with TV news channel ANN7, Leon said Maimane s push to have Zille suspended was his litmus test for leadership in the party.He warned if Maimane failed to deal decisively with Zille, his authority in leading a historically white political party, aiming to swell its ranks with black voters, would be undermined.He said Zille s position as Western Cape premier and Maimane s as party leader was fertile breeding ground for an inevitable collision at some point . It s not just about what she said and what he said, its about the structural relationship between a leader and a former leader and it s a very difficult thing to navigate, Leon said. How it plays out will be determinative of Mmusi Maimane s future leadership.If he does not prevail in this matter, he won t be an effective leader going forward. Leon s comments come against the background of a tug of war between Maimane and Zille.Maimane was seemingly presumptuous in announcing at the weekend that the party s federal executive had suspended Zille as federal executive chair James Selfe later put the breaks on the matter, pending Zille s representations to the party s highest decision making body.Leon, while acknowledging that there were political schisms within the party over Zille s tweets in connection with colonialism and how they should be tackled, said factionalism was par for the course in the running of any political organisation. There are always factions in political organisations, when I was the leader of the DA, there were plenty of factions, I think Helen led one of them against me, but so what, in a party you can t all be of one mind, Leon said. But the leader has got to prevail on matters of overall strategy and setting the policy and tone for the party and there aren t two leaders, there s one, that s what this is about at the end of the day. While saying Zille should stow her interests beneath those of the party and resign, Leon said he does not believe Zille harboured any resentment towards the post-apartheid dispensation. I think her place in history should be about all she s done, not just about this latest saga, which would be a tragedy incidentally.She is a genuine non-racist, she made an enormous contribution to South Africa. From exposing the murders of Steve Biko right through to growing the DA, that s what her legacy should be about. BONOLO SELEBANO
