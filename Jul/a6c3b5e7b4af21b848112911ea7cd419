The Lions have shown once again why they deserve to be the country s biggest hope of Super Rugby success when they ran in 14 tries over the Sunwolves in a 94-7 win on Saturday.While the unexpected happened in Durban, where a Bulls side that was hapless all season won against a Sharks outfit that has been on the up, the win by Johan Ackermann s men proved to be the most significant of the weekend.Ruan Combrinck helped himself to a hat-trick of tries, while Jaco Kriel, Kwagga Smith and Ross Cronje scored a brace each. Elton Jantjies, Akker van der Merwe, Courtnall Skosan, Faf de Klerk, Sylvian Mahuza and Ruan Ackermann also got in on the massive try scoring act.Ackermann called the victory the team s proudest moment even though not many people will remember it.That was Ackermann s way of highlighting just how important it is for his side to win the Super Rugby title, especially since he will be leaving at the end of the season to join Gloucester. It is an achievement that we are proud of but nobody will remember that in a few weeks time. They only remember the guys who lift the Super Rugby trophy. Before we can get there there are some tough challenges ahead. We still have a lot of work to get through before we can even think about the trophy, Ackermann said.Meanwhile, some Bulls players took the game against the Sharks as a chance to impress incoming coach John Mitchell, beating the Sharks 30-17 away from home.Warrick Gelant scored a hat-trick of tries.The Kings and Stormers also recorded victories.mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
