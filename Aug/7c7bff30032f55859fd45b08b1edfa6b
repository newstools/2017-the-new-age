THE aim to finally empower and develop emerging Eastern Cape farmers to become commercial farmers will be addressed tomorrow by the Black Business Council (BBC).A partnership called The BBC Grain Production Project came up with an initiative that involves Ikhephu Agri Secondary Cooperative based in Elliot and mentors.They will be some of the market leaders and among the top 100 listed JSE companies in the agricultural value chain.BBC President Danisa Baloyi says this transformation from emerging to commercial farmers will be achieved through the execution of an integrated value chain model.He says this includes the process from inception, inputs through to conclusion sale at the Miller-cycle system of production and will then last for a period of five years having started in 2016. To keep up with the growth in human population, more food will have to be produced over the next 50 years than during the past 10 000 years, Baloyi said. There are also challenges such as climate change, water shortages and dwindling oil reserves. World grain reserves are also at their lowest levels, notably more so than in previous years. One of the key challenges facing emerging farmers is their lack of collateral and security. It means they often cannot access production finance and hence cannot use their resource base to its fullest capability.It has, therefore, become imperative that any financial product or solution to enable emerging farmers to access production finance and support must overcome the inherent financial risks. Baloyi said it was the reason why the BBC has partnered with some grain companies to embark on a journey to intervene and create a model with the aim of assisting emerging farmers to become self-sufficient.He said the objectives were to transform the agricultural sector, change ways of black participation and move up the value chain to be value creators.Baloyi said it was to combine financial and market access incentives, benefit upscaling of business competencies, provide a platform to ensure strategic focus and effective delivery while reducing risk, while driving entrepreneurial spirit and mentorship.Meanwhile, 35 maize farmers in Ngxingxolo village, Mooiplaas, outside East London, are struggling to sell their harvest. They said they d been trying to get the government s help for more than 10 years.Mvusiwekhaya Sicwetsha, the spokesperson for Eastern Cape rural development and agrarian reform MEC Mlibo Qoboshiyane, said he was not aware of the struggle facing the Mooiplaas farmers and promised to follow up.It is the department s duty to assist farmers in finding a market for them. Sicwetsha said they had offices in all towns, which were always open to all farmers.He said their district office would contact farmers to see their work and then look at supporting them. There is potential for good business for farmers in the Eastern Cape, unfortunately, even though the maize crop for 2017 for South Africa is forecast to be double that of 2016 and a large surplus of several million tons is predicted, farmers in Eastern Cape villages have to give their crops away as they have nowhere to sell their crops.Baloyi says success will only be achieved once there is a contribution to the GDP, a transformation of the sector, the ability to create jobs and to usher in food security, which leads to the creation of sustainable skills transfer.
