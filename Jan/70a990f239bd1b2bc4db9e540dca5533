The provincial MEC for Education Debbie Schafer has expressed that she is pleased that incidents of and vandalism continue to reduce year-on-year.&#8220;We are therefore pleased to see that the number of incidents has dropped once again, this time to 17. The figures suggest that extra security and vigilant communities are helping to reduce the incidents of vandalism at our schools,&#8221; said Schafer.Schafer has indicated that the reduction was achieved by the provincial departments deployment of additional security to schools that were identified as high risk, including other law enforcement.&#8220;I must acknowledge the continuous decline in reported incidents year on year, and for this I would like to thank Safe Schools, Metro Police, SAPS and members of the community for their sustained efforts in assisting us in putting an end to vandalism and burglary in our schools,&#8221; she said.About 21 reported incidents during the December 2015 and January 2016 school holidays compared to December 2016 and January 2017 which stands at 17 reported incidents.The department has spent at least a quarter of a million rand to repair schools vandalised during the holidays.However, a cost analysis still needs to be completed for other three schools of the 17 vandalised.&#8220;The Western Cape Education Department (WCED) is completing a cost analysis. So far, the cost for repairs for 14 of the 17 schools has come in at just under R250 000.&#8220;While I am pleased that the incidents were mostly classified as minor , we could better spend these funds on improving the quality of education in schools. At the end of the day, vandalism represents theft from our learners,&#8221; said Schafer.Schafer has urged the community to be extra vigilant throughout the year and to immediately report any suspicious behavior or activities that occur within the vicinity of their schools to the SAPS or their Safe Schools Hotline 0800 45 46 47.-Keitumetsi Motlhale
