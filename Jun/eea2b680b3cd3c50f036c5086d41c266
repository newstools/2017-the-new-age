The South Gauteng High Court is today expected to deliver its judgment in the Frankel 8 case.The court earlier reserved its judgment on an application challenging the law that places a statute of limitations on sexual abuse cases that do not include penetration.This follows a high profile case against late billionaire stockbroker Sydney Frankel in which eight people who accused him of sexual molestation over 10 years about 30 years ago were precluded from instituting criminal charges against him due to the prescription laws.At the time of his death earlier this year, Frankel was facing multiple cases of child molestation and sexual abuse.He died of cancer at his Johannesburg home in April.Frankel was accused of sexually abusing the complainants in the 1970s and 1980s when they were very young.NGO Women and Men Against Child Abuse (WMACA) said it hoped for a positive judgment which would clear the way for the matter to be taken to the Constitutional Court. We further hope that the unconstitutionality of Section 18 of the Sexual Offences Act is acknowledged and rubberstamped by the Constitutional Court as soon as possible so that it can be presented to Parliament, the organisation said.The organisation says it wants the laws amended to accommodate all sexual abuse victims. WMACA said the law was constitutionally flawed.The law does not allow for victims of sexual abuse of any kind which occurred prior to 2007 to have their cases heard in court.If successful, the case will open the way for victims of sexual abuse to come forward and institute criminal charges against their perpetrators, regardless of when the abuse took place.WMACA has been actively supporting the applicants in the case.LERATO DIALEleratod@thenewage.co.za
