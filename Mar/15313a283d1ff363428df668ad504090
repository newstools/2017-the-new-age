With Baroka FC now serious relegation candidates, the least they are hoping for now is to finish in the promotion/relegation play-off spot.The PSL rookies played to a 1-1 draw against Polokwane City on Sunday and find themselves rooted at the bottom of the log with 14 points from 20 matches, three behind 15th placed Highlands Park who defeated Free State Stars on Sunday.With 10 games to go before the end of the season, Baroka are in serious trouble with two tough back-to-back matches coming up against title chasers Kaizer Chiefs and SuperSport United. They also have hard fixtures against Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns in their remaining matches but coach Kgoloko Thobejane is hopeful that they can at least finish in the play-offs spot. Out of 10 games, if we can achieve 18 points we will be happy to go through to the playoffs, Thobejane said. Eighteen points out of 10 games, it means we are left with 30 points to play for but it s still a struggle with a long way to go. Having only scored a single goal this year, Thobejane admitted that they needed to fix that if they were to survive.Richard Matloga is their top goal scorer this season with three goals, proving just how poor they have been in front of goals. The confidence is there but if you are not scoring goals it s a problem. Football is about scoring goals and we are not doing that, the coach said. The team is not scoring but we are able to create chances.Against Polokwane City we had sitters but we were unable to convert. Baroka s next league match is against Chiefs on March 18 at Peter Mokaba stadium. But before that, they have a date against FC Cape Town in the Nedbank Cup last 32 in Cape Town on Saturday. Can I say we will go to FC Cape Town and win the game and be happy with that? I won t be that happy. I will be pleased if we play the league game and come away with maximum points. -Neville Khoza|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
