Mosimane wailed on the lack of goals pointing that the score board would have been better if it was 1-1 or any other draw with goals.However Mosimane thanked the side, &#8220;We want to thank the coach and Azam for giving us the opportunity to play here. As you know, we wanted to play two more games against Simba and Yanga (Dar Young Africans), but that did not happen.&#8221;Mamelodi Sundowns arrived in Tanzania on Monday and are due to return to South Africa on Friday.Yanga, a team Mosimane&#8217;s side was hoping to play, opted to continue with preparations for their league match instead.Mosimane said that: &#8220;We are however happy with the game. It was a good game but not easy, as Azam made it difficult for us, we could not score and were frustrated. We kept pushing our opponents into their half and did not seriously test the goalkeeper.&#8221;Included in the Sundown&#8217;s starting line up was Wayne Sandilands in goal, with both Anele Ngconca and Yannick Zakri getting game time, coming back from injuries.
