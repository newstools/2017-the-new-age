The National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union (NEHAWU) and National Parliament have reached an agreement on salary increases for its employees for the 2017/18 financial year.The 7.5% salary increase will take effect retrospectively from 1 April 2017 and will cover all employees in the bargaining unit.Workers had previously accused parliament of diverting money from workers to other projects, including the new Parliamentary protection services.Workers also wanted performance bonuses to be based on annual and not monthly salaries. Parliament s management and NEHAWU agreed to the 7.5% salary increase as the best position, given the unfavorable economic climate in the country and budget cuts by the National Treasury, Parliament said in a statement.Parliament further said that Negotiations will continue on other outstanding matters through institutionalised platforms outlined in the recognition agreement, including monthly Management and NEHAWU meetings.Workers have been on strike since 2015, for the issues to be addressed.-TNA Reporter
