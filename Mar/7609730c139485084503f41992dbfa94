The duo accused of beating a man and then forcing him into a coffin appeared in the Middelburg Regional Court yesterday where a new charge of attempted murder was added to their charge sheet.Farmers Willem Oosthuizen and Theo Martins Jackson appeared briefly in court yesterday where their trial date was set for 26 to 29 June.The two have been behind bars since November last year after they were denied bail by the magistrate in December.Magistrate Jongilizwe Dumehleli said at the time that it would not be in the public interest for the accused to be released on bail, therefore their application was dismissed.They are facing charges of kidnapping, assault and attempted murder.In their previous court appearance, the two said in their affidavit that they merely wanted to teach Rethabile Victor Mlotshwa a lesson for trespassing on private property and that they did not mean any harm.Mlotshwa was assaulted with a knobkerrie, forced into a coffin and was also beaten all over the body.The accused also threatened to pour petrol over Mlotshwa and set him alight, and put a snake in coffin with him as he cried, and pleaded for his life.A harrowing video of the two farmers assaulting Mlotshwa went viral on social media last year, causing an outraged debate on racism.The video showed the two farmers beating Mlotshwa and forcing him into the coffin. Mlotshwa was left traumatised by the incident that happened on August 17.news@thenewage.co.za
