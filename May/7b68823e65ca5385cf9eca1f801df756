I have proven that disabled people are also capable people, Mlangeni said. This award honours the contribution I have made since 1963 when I began my music career. I have used my disability to inspire other disabled musicians, among them Steve Kekana. What excites me is the fact that I am being honoured while I am still alive. Many musicians do not get such a chance, so this is a great feeling for me. The SAMA 23 event will take place on the 27 May in Sun City and will be broadcast live on SABC1 at 8pm.-TNA Reporter
