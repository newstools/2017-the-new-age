&nbsp;Gauteng has pledged to ensure that black businesses and township enterprises become more sustainable and intends to increase its spending on township-based enterprises.Addressing the province on Monday, Gauteng Premier David Makhura said the provincial government had reached a critical point at which 91% of its procurement budget of R46bn over the mid-term expenditure framework was directed to empower black people, women, youth and people with disabilities. Of the 12000 companies that conduct business with our provincial administration, 10000 of them are historically disadvantaged individuals or township enterprises, he said.The number of township enterprises benefiting from public procurement policy had increased threefold from 800 in 2014 to more than 2 800 by January 2017. We have also continued to invest in economic infrastructure in the townships, including the refurbishment of industrial parks and providing broadband connectivity, establishment of ekasi labs for technology start-ups as well as training and skills development for township enterprises and SMMEs. Since taking over the provincial government, Makhura has been prioritising small and township businesses.Last year he condemned government departments that failed to pay small businesses within 30 days. Statistics indicated since 1994, small business activity in SA had grown in line with the country s gross domestic product.The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor SA report shows that 19.7% of the adult population in 2001 saw opportunities to start a business, but by 2014 this figure had increased to 37%. However, non-payment for services had become a major issue.Gauteng has in the years 2014 and 2016 increased its spending on the township economy from R600m to R6bn to reach its target of 30% budget spend by 2019.Makhura said the Gauteng administration would set conditions for big companies doing business with government to subcontract at least 30% of the main contract to qualifying black firms and township enterprises in a manner that ensured their meaningful participation.SAMUEL MUNGADZE|samuelm@thenewage.co.za
