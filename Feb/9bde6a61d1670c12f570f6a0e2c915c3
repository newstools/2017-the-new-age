A court in Zimbabwe on Wednesday released on bail the pastor who last year led a surge of protests against President Robert Mugabe and is now facing subversion charges.&#8220;It is ordered that (Evan Mawarire) be admitted to bail,&#8221; judge Clement Phiri said following Mawarire&#8217;s High Court bail application.The court ordered Mawarire to surrender his passport and report twice a week to the police as well as paying a $300 (280 euro) bond. He will next appear in court on February 17.Mawarire, an evangelical pastor, started the popular &#8220;This Flag&#8221; protest movement last year, becoming a figurehead of opposition to Mugabe&#8217;s regime.Mawarire was arrested on Wednesday February 1 at Harare airport as he returned to the country after fleeing in July in fear for his life when Mugabe publicly denounced him.Phiri described the prosecution&#8217;s case as &#8220;weak&#8221; while prosecutor Edmore Nyazamba insisted that Mawarire was &#8220;a celebrated terrorist&#8221; who would abscond if bailed.Zimbabwe security forces cracked down last year after internet activism by the &#8220;This Flag&#8221; movement led to a series of anti-government protests and work strikes.The national flag became a symbol of anti-government protests after the then little-known pastor posted a Facebook video in which he had the flag wound around his neck as he deplored the country&#8217;s worsening economic crisis.Mawarire&#8217;s sister Teldah Mawarire tweeted that is was &#8220;great&#8221; that Evan had been released.&#8220;Activists should not be persecuted in the first place. Free expression is a human right,&#8221; she wrote.-AFP
