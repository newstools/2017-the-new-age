The bodies of 16 soldiers have been recovered in northeast Nigeria, nearly three months after an attack on a coalition force claimed by Boko Haram Islamists, the military has said.The Islamic State group affiliate announced on October 17 last year it had &#8220;stormed a joint position of the armies of Nigeria and Niger&#8221; in Gashagar, Borno state, killing 20 soldiers.Local community leaders in the border area confirmed the attack at the time, saying the soldiers were caught unawares and suffered &#8220;huge casualties&#8221;, without specifying how many.On Wednesday, Nigerian Army Major General Leo Irabor said the missing troops were found by soldiers and vigilantes on January 5 after clearing villages between Damasak and Gashagar.&#8220;At Asagar village, our troops encountered and dislodged some BHT (Boko Haram terrorists) elements,&#8221; Irabor, who commands the counter-insurgency operation, told reporters.&#8220;Subsequently, the troops recovered corpses of one officer and 15 soldiers earlier declared missing in action during their dislodgment from Gashagar on October 16, 2016.&#8221;The bodies were discovered in a river and had since been buried with full honours, he told a news conference in Maiduguri, the biggest city in the region.Confirmation of military casualties has been rare throughout the conflict in the remote region, as have claims and counter-claims from both sides.But Nigeria&#8217;s military has begun regular briefings to give updates on the counter-insurgency, particularly as it has gained the upper hand in the fighting.Troops from Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon make up a regional force battling the insurgents, who have also launched cross-border attacks around the Lake Chad area.Irabor on Wednesday described Boko Haram as &#8220;in disarray and&#8230; desperate&#8221;, yet attacks continue, underlining the threat from the group.Last weekend, at least five soldiers were killed at a military base in Buni Yadi, Yobe state, while five suicide bombers killed themselves and three others in Maiduguri.-AFP
