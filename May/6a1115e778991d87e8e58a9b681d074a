The countdown to the completion of construction work on the M1 freeway between Oxford and Federation bridges in Johannesburg has begun.This R127m project which was set to rehabilitate the stretch of the freeway is 75% complete, with most of the underground conditions on the southbound section having been filled and stabilised.The freeway carries more than 80000 commercial, private and public transport vehicles daily.The MMC for transport, Nonhlanhla Makhuba, said the construction had entered its final stages with a lane switch-over and new traffic implications for road users. This is a heart-warming moment. This is where we get to see the wheels of the economy literally turning. We are committed to achieving 5% economic growth and reducing unemployment among the residents of Johannesburg, Makhuba said.She said a high-quality road network was an essential element of a prosperous and thriving city able to attract much-needed investment.The state of Johannesburg s roads and the infrastructure network is among the city s top list of priorities. The MMC said she was impressed with the work that had been done so far.However, she warned motorists to expect more traffic disruptions as the project entered its final stages. I am requesting road users to continue being patient because this project is going to benefit all of us, Makhuba said.The Johannesburg Road Agency managing director, Dr Sean Phillips, said dozens of vehicles using the Oxford Road offramp during morning peak hours would be affected during the last phase of the construction as the off-ramp on the northbound carriageway would be closed.Phillips added that the application of protective coatings was also under way and work would now move to the northbound section of the M1, necessitating a switch-over of lanes. At the beginning of the project last year some northbound traffic lanes between Jan Smuts and Oxford roads were closed off, heavily affecting traffic. With the work almost complete in that section, the focus now will be on the southbound lanes, he explained.He said the city was grateful to road users who responded positively to the rehabilitation process over the past year by adjusting their travel times and traffic patterns, making use of advertised alternative routes and public transport.According to JRA engineer Esther Schmidt, from this week two lanes in each direction, south- and northbound, will remain open on the freeway.The southbound Ettrick Road on-ramp will be reopened, while the northbound Oxford Road offramp will be closed.NONDUMISO ZWANEnondumiso@thenewage.co.za
