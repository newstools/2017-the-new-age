Some Twitter commentators branded Miss SA as a racist for serving black children wearing gloves &#8211; but she has defended her actions by saying the gloves were for hygiene purposes.Photographs of Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters caused a storm on Twitter when she was wearing gloves while working with kids at the Ikageng Community Centre at Soweto yesterday.Nel-Peters posted her pictures of herself wearing gloves while serving food.Her spokesperson Claudia Henkel said Nel-Peters had no malicious intentions.&#8220;Our intentions were completely innocent going into the home. We were handed the gloves together with all other volunteers as we walked in and it was purely for hygiene purposes. The thing is it was such a busy day, so we hopped from preparing food to playing with the children. We did not think that the pictures would cause such a hype on Twitter as they were really innocent,&#8221; she said.To everyone asking about the gloves, I truly hope that you&#39;ll hear my heart and understand that it came from a place of wanting to do good. pic.twitter.com/Pl5amM2gEM&mdash; Demi-LeighNel-Peters (@DemiLeighNP) July 5, 2017Even black twitter was divided on the matter.
