Legislation effectively rules out the possibility of anyone accumulating shares by being put in a position to exert undue influence over the South African Reserve Bank (SARB), Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said.He gave this assurance in reply to a written Parliamentary question by David Maynier of the DA.Maynier had asked Gibaba if he had found that any persons, families and or associates of persons and or families were trying, through the purchase of shares, to exert undue influence over the SARB.Gigaba wrote back to him, saying: No. Currently the provisions of the South African Reserve Bank Act, 1989 (Act No 90 of 1989), as amended by the South African Reserve Bank Amendment Act, 2010 (Act No 4 of 2010), effectively rule out the possibility of anyone, through the accumulation of shares, exerting undue influence on the South African Reserve Bank. The SARB board, Gigaba said, was a supervisory board and was strictly responsible for the corporate governance of the institution and not its dayto-day management. The governors are vested with original powers of management and are responsible for the day-to-day management of the SARB, which includes monetary policy, bank supervision, financial stability and the payment system, Gigaba said.Previously, he said, in the period before the SARB Act was amended in 2010, there was an absence of adequate preventative measures. Private shareholding in the central bank could potentially have created the risk of untoward actions by shareholders taken in pursuit of personal objectives rather than the public interest.However, the SARB Amendment Act was introduced to make substantial amendments to the legal structure and operations of the SARB. Included in the raft of changes was one that adequately addressed the previous anomaly. Consequently, shareholders of the SARB have limited powers, which in addition to the above, are limited to discussing the annual report and financial statements of the SARB, appointing of the auditors and approving their remuneration and discussing special business. -DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
