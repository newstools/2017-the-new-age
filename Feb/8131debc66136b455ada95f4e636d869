ANOTHER case of land evasion has been condemned by the Thembisile Hani municipality. This comes as land is being illegally occupied at Kings Park in KwaMhlanga. The municipality was granted an eviction and restraining order against the occupiers by the North Gauteng High Court on January 15, an order that still stands. We humbly request the unlawful occupiers who have already invaded the area to vacate the area voluntarily as this action is against the court order that was granted, municipality spokesperson Simphiwe Mashiyane said. The municipality said unlawful occupiers have seven days to voluntarily move from the land. If they fail to honour the request, it will lead to the implementation of the court order by the municipality. The municipality condemns land invasion, hence we are constantly engaging with traditional leaders and urging them to follow proper procedures when there is a need for land development to settle residents. This must be done through the municipality s town planning unit, Mashiyane said. The Department of Rural Development and Land Reform said they will help unlawful occupiers of either private or state land who have no agricultural land to obtain access to suitable land that is legally available. This along with assisting with finding alternative land for unlawful occupiers in need of housing. Where required, they will assist private agricultural landowners whose land has been unlawfully invaded to relocate occupiers in need of agricultural land to suitable alternative land. HLONI MASHIGO
