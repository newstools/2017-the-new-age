Tottenham Hotspur’s patchy away from in the Premier League continued with a 1-1 draw at Watford but the North London club will be pleased with a point after playing much of the second half with 10 men on Saturday. Spurs had centre back Davinson Sanchez sent off in the 52nd minute for elbowing in the face livewire winger Richarlison, whose darting runs down the left flank caused problems for the visitors all afternoon. One such raid resulted in a Tom Cleverley corner which defender Christian Kabasele headed home superbly to give Watford a 13th-minute lead, before Son Heung-min levelled with a simple close-range tap-in after Christian Eriksen’s fine low cross. The visitors were on the back foot after Sanchez was shown a straight red card and they came close to falling behind again several minutes later, as Abdoulaye Doucoure hit the post with a screaming shot from 25 metres. -Reuters
