THE Maruleng municipality in Hoedspruit and the Mopani district municipality (of which the former falls under its jurisdiction) have come under fire from the DA for allegedly spending thousands of rands on luxury accommodation for meetings in the neighbouring Mpumalanga province. DA provincial leader and member of the provincial legislature Jacques Smalle says the Maruleng municipality paid more than R15000 for the venue at the luxury Blyde River Canyon resort as well as transport and food for councillors ballooning the costs to thousands of rands more. The Maruleng municipality does not have funds to buy ink cartridges for printing municipal documents and cannot conduct eye tests for drivers licences due to financial constraints, yet it happily wastes funds on lavish meetings at Mpumalanga resorts, Smalle said. He said the Mopani district municipality held a three-day strategic planning session in the beginning of February at the same venue. The DA urges cooperative governance human settlements and traditional affairs MEC Makoma Makhurupetje to take action against officials who organise these meetings and hold them accountable for wasting public money, he said. Maruleng municipality spokesperson John Seokoma denied there was a shortage of ink to print documents. The fact that we held meetings in Mpumalanga is immaterial because South Africa is a unitary state. We were forced to move council meetings to Blyde River Canyon resort to avoid disruptions at home. This after previous council meetings were disrupted. I am not aware about the collapse of eye test facilities for drivers licences and I will check with our traffic station, Seokoma said.
