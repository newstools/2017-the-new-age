Everton captain Phil Jagielka said Tuesday his side will be especially fired-up to win this weekend&#8217;s Merseyside derby against Liverpool after a horrific injury suffered by team-mate Seamus Coleman on international duty.Republic of Ireland defender Coleman is set to be sidelined for months after undergoing an operation on leg bones broken as a result of a tackle by Neil Taylor of Wales, who was sent off for the challenge, in last week&#8217;s goalless World Cup qualifier in DublinJagielka hopes to speak to Coleman ahead of Saturday&#8217;s short trip to Liverpool&#8217;s Anfield ground &#8212; a venue where Everton have not won since 1999.Just three days after the derby clash, Everton face Manchester United at Old Trafford and Jagielka told everton.tv on Tuesday: &#8220;We&#8217;ll all be thinking about him and, come Saturday and Tuesday, I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll have the TV on and be cheering us on.&#8220;There&#8217;ll be no incentive needed, but the circumstances over the last few days might add a bit of a motivational edge on our behalf.&#8221;We want to go out there and play well and it will be nice if we can all get to speak to Seamus beforehand.&#8221;Right-back Coleman has started 26 of Everton&#8217;s 29 Premier League matches so far this season and fellow defender Jagielka added: &#8220;Seamus is a massive part of the furniture. He&#8217;s been here a long time now, he&#8217;s one of the leaders.&#8220;All we can do is be there for him. He&#8217;s had the operation, it&#8217;s been a success and he&#8217;s on the slow road to recovery.&#8221;As a club, a family, we have wished him a speedy recovery and we will be with him every step of the way. He&#8217;s a great lad and hopefully we can get him smiling around the club as soon as possible.&#8220;He&#8217;ll be down at the moment because it&#8217;s not long since it happened.&#8221;His friends and family away from football will help him through these initial stages.&#8220;When he is able to do things it&#8217;s up to us as a club &#8211; the players, physios, coaches.&#8221;I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll be able to get him to where he needs to get to.&#8221;-AFP
