The Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs ministry (Cogta) has urged communities and initiation school leaders to ensure that those undergoing initiation comply with all the stipulated requirements.This is as the winter initiation season got off to a deadly start.Two initiates from KwaMhlanga and Gemsbokspruit in Mpumalanga died days after the season kicked off on Monday.Many thousands are expected to take part in the cultural rite of passage across the country.Minister Des van Rooyen said his department was committed to working with traditional leaders, parents and other departments including the health department, the police and the National Prosecuting Authority to bring an end to initiation deaths.The mushrooming of illegal initiation schools, the lack of proper medical pre-screening and dehydration among others have previously been blamed for the high death toll during initiation season.The assault of initiates has also been cited in some of the fatalities.Van Rooyen said no stone would be left unturned in the quest to find the cause of deaths of the two initiates and said understanding the cause might help save many others who will undergo initiation.So far no other fatalities have been reported since the start of the season.Deputy Minister Obed Bapela called on communities to adopt a zero tolerance approach to initiation deaths. We therefore urge all communities and those leading the initiation schools to ensure that all initiates entering this sacred path are complying with all the stipulated requirements, have parental consent, undergo medical screening and ensure that initiation schools and traditional surgeons are registered, Bapela said.Van Rooyen expressed sadness and said he had hoped that the winter initiation season would be incident free.Last year, 27 initiates deaths were recorded nationally during the winter initiation period, with 44 deaths recorded in 2015 during the same time.The department has called on communities to report any wrong on 0800111166.
