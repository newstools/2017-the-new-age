Amajita threw away an excellent opportunity to book their spot in the World Cup on Thursday as they submitted to a 4-3 beating to the Senegal team.The South African team was leading with a convincing 2-0 score going into half time. The CAF u20 Africa Cup of Nations match played in Zambia could easily have been Amajita&#8217;s win as they went into the second half with a two goal cushion.However the events of the second half turned what seem like a sealed game into a disappointing lose. The Senegal team came back early in the second half with a goal by Ndiaye in the 48th minute to rise the bar. A few minutes later he came with an equalizer.Amajitas Coach, Thabo Senong says that their defence tactics in the second half of the match is one of the reasons that gave the match away .&#8220;It was a disappointing second half but the lesson came at a good time. We will now have to make sure we go back to basics when we play against Sudan this coming Sunday,&#8221; said Senong.With a win, Amajita will have a chance to book their spot to qualify for the upcoming FIFA World Cup that will be hosted in South Korea this year in May. They will be travelling to Lusaka for their last Group B match against Sudan at the Heroes National Stadium.The results of the match puts Amajita and Cameroon all equal with three points as they go into their final group matches on the 5th of March.The four teams that will come up top at the continental competition will qualify for the 2017 FIFA U20 World Cup in South Korea.-TNA Reporter &nbsp;
