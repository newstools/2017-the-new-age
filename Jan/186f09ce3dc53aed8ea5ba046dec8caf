Duanne Olivier may have caught the eyes of many on his Test debut for the Proteas in their final match of the series against Sri Lanka but he has made peace with the fact that he could be replaced by the returning Morn Morkel when the Proteas tour New Zealand for a three Test series in March.Olivier finished with four wickets in both innings at Wanderers Stadium as South Africa cruised to a 3-0 series whitewash.With the Proteas to tour New Zealand next, the 24 year old says he would understand if the selectors opt for Morkel. There are guys who are coming back like Morn Morkel and Dale Steyn and I m not too fazed to lose the position to them, Olivier said. I will just continue to work hard at franchise level and wait for another opportunity. I understand they have been performing well in the last 10 years for the country. I will get my opportunity and I will wait for it. With two balls remaining before stumps on day one, Olivier was asked to be night watchman after the dismissal of JP Duminy. I have never done it (night watchman) before, even at franchise level. But I thought it is an opportunity to do it for my country. It didn t go according to plan but I was very happy. I was nervous going there batting with a guy like Hashim Amla, it was an unbelievable experience. Faf du Plessis asked me if I want to do it and I decided, why not, it s an opportunity. It was scary but it was quite exciting. Everyone welcomed me to the team and I felt part of the family. I was very new to some things but it was fun, exciting and memorable.
