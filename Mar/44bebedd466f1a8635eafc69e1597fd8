The Anti-Racism Network South Africa has called on all sectors of society to support Anti-Racism Week 2017.Speaking to ANN7, the network s national coordinator Sean Moodley said: In the past year, we have seen far too many overt racist incidents. This issue cannot be sitting on the back burner. It is time for us to be frank, and tackle the problem head on .Moodley said that the week gives South Africans a platform to talk about race. We are once again urging South Africans to #TakeOnRacism. The network was founded by the Nelson Mandela and Ahmed Kathrada Foundations in 2015.The theme for this year s campaign will focus on the idea of everybody becoming a champion against racism. The themes are universal and apply to all regardless of political or any other affiliation. We hope that they resonate not just during Anti-Racism Week, but throughout the year so that tackling racism becomes an everyday phenomenon, said Moodley. Minister of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa in February stated that there was no place for racism in South Africa and if people work together, it can be defeated. We reiterate our call to all citizens to unite and fight racism. If we work together, we can defeat this atrocious ideology, said Mthethwa.-TNA Reporter
