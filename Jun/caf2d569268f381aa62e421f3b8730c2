THE Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (NMMU) is set to relaunch itself as Nelson Mandela University.The institution is the only higher education facility in the world to bear the name of struggle icon Nelson Mandela and will relaunch around the time the world will mark what would have been his 99th birthday. Outgoing NMMU vice-chancellor professor Derrick Swartz said: We are hugely honoured and privileged to bear the name of one of the world s greatest icons, a man whose humble beginnings, values and hopes resonate with our own hopes for a transformed and better future for all.It was the former statesman himself who highlighted the key role of universities as agents central to renewal . The institution said the launch of NMMU was yet another important milestone in the journey the university set itself when it adopted the institutional Vision 2020.This vision enjoined the institution s leaders to work relentlessly towards building a new generation, dynamic African university, recognised for its leadership in producing cutting-edge knowledge for a sustainable future.However, the university said it had elected not to immediately formally use the new name as it believed adequate preparations were necessary to ensure that in using the name of Nelson Mandela, the former president was honoured respectfully and appropriately in ways befitting his stature.Sufficient progress to this effect, including changing university logos and colours had been realised. The university is thus pleased to share that the name Nelson Mandela University will be officially used from the second semester of this year, the institution said.To mark this important milestone, NMMU said a celebratory event was planned for July 20 and would take place at one of the university s campuses located in the community of Missionvale in Port Elizabeth that used to be the old Vista campus.The new name not only comes with an opportunity to rebrand and position the institution continentally and globally but also to usher in a new era of renewed vigour towards meaningful transformation.NMMU has said that the launch of Nelson Mandela University would not only be a celebration of the efforts to be named after the great leader but of the university s commitment to transformation and truly living out its values which mirror those of Mandela.
