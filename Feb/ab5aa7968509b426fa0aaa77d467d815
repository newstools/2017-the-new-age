Due to the high incidence of ATM card fraud, the South African Banking Risk Information Centre (Sabric) once again urged people to be extremely vigilant when transacting at ATMs and be on the lookout for loitering criminals.Sabric also wanted to draw bank customers attention to an existing modus operandi, which has become prevalent again, to ensure they were empowered to protect themselves and to prevent them from falling victim to criminals. Sabric CEO Kalyani Pillay said: Transacting at ATMs is quick and convenient but unfortunately criminals exploit this facility for their own fraudulent purposes. Criminals use various ways to manipulate and distract ATM users in order to gain access to their bankcards and PINs, and of course ultimately, steal their money. She said criminals used numerous modus operandi to commit this kind of crime, so it was imperative that bank customers be aware and take the necessary protective measures. One of the most common methods was card swapping when a bank user would be approached by an unknown person/s who would try to assist the victim.This is all part of the trick and the victim s card would be taken out of the ATM by the criminal who presses the cancel button for the card to eject. It is then that the card is swopped without the bank customer even realising it and during this process of assisting, the fraudster is close enough to view the PIN number.When the victim leaves the ATM after the unsuccessful transaction, either with someone else s card, which they don t realise at that point, the fraudster slips away with the victim s card and PIN number. Criminals attempt to confuse bank customers, making them more inclined to accept assistance at ATMs by changing the language on the ATM screen so that it looks unfamiliar to a customer, Pillay said. Some of the Sabric tips to customers to avoid falling into the fraudsters trap was to cancel the transaction immediately if they think the ATM is faulty. Avoid ATMs that are dimly lit or surrounded by loiterers and never allow your children to draw money using your card since they re the most vulnerable to perpetrators. -Vincent Cruywagen|vincentc@thenewage.co.za
