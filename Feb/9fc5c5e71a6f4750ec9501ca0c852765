A new report, titled The Future of Sex, predicts a world of virtual sex where celebrities would sell their robotic replicas sooner than imagined.The report further states that one in 10 people will have had sex with a humanoid robot by 2045, with 3D-printed body parts of their lover, enabled with touch feedback for those in long distance relationships expected to be out by 2025.These predictions come hot on the heels of a recent life-like replica of actress Scarlett Johansson by Hong Kong graphic designer Ricky Ma, which is not a sex robot but winks and giggles.It is a fact that celebrities hold sway over people s imaginations, so much so, that most fans have secret fantasies about their favourite stars. The possibility of acting out fantasies with your favourite celebrity could soon be the norm if these reports are anything to go by.London based futurist David Levy, author of Love And Sex With Robots, recently spoke to the UK s Daily Mail about the increasing demand for celebrity sex robots. You can imagine people saying, I ve got a sex robot who looks like Angelina Jolie and she s fabulous in bed! If you re Angelina Jolie and there s a company manufacturing a high-quality product and you re getting a royalty of 1000-2000 (R16000-R32000) for each one, you could make even more millions than you ve got just by licensing your appearance, he said.SIYABONGA SITHOLE
