South Korean conglomerate Samsung Group said on Monday it could not accept the special prosecutors&#8217; accusations that its leader, Jay Y. Lee, paid bribes to further his succession or the merger of two affiliates in 2015.&#8220;It is difficult to understand the special prosecution&#8217;s decision,&#8221; Samsung Group said in an email statement in response to the special prosecutors&#8217; decision to request an arrest warrant for Lee, the third-generation leader of South Korea&#8217;s top conglomerate.The prosecutors also said in their indictment of National Pension Service (NPS) chief Moon Hyung-pyo that he received an order from President Park Geun-hye to help the 2015 merger of Samsung C&amp;T Corp and Cheil Industries Inc succeed.Moon was indicted on charges of abuse of power and giving false testimony. He was arrested in December after acknowledging ordering the world&#8217;s third-largest pension fund to support the $8 billion merger last year of two Samsung Group affiliates while he was head of the health ministry, which oversees the NPS.-Reuters
