The residents of Kopanong informal settlement in Tshwane yesterday took to the streets in anger in protest against poor service delivery.Community member Jan Mahlangu said they were promised running water, flushing toilets, roads and electricity by the previous administration but were yet to receive any of those things.Those protesting were a group of people moved from Stokfel Park and Extension 11 informal settlement in June 2015 to Kopanong informal settlement.They claim to had been told this would be their permanent home and they would receive all the services they needed but nothing had been done. The city must keep its promise, we don t care about the new administration, Mahlangu said.Another resident, Jack Mashiya, said the water they were drinking from a water tank was dirty and the mobile toilets had not been emptied for two weeks. They dumped them and forgot about them, Mashiya said.The protest started on Monday night at about 11pm. The residents blocked the main road, Solomon Mahlangu Drive, with rocks, burning tyres, stones, rocks and rubbish, preventing motorists from using the road.Traffic was a nightmare for motorists who had to find alternative routes to get to work.Tshwane mayoral committee member for housing, Mandla Nkomo and councillors visited the area after the protest. Nkomo said the previous administration promised the residents service delivery would be prioritised. Unfortunately we are struggling with the budget at the moment. The budget is a challenge and it won t be fixed overnight, Nkomo said.DIMAKATSO MODIPAnews@thenewage.co.za
