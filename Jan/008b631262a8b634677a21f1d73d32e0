South Africa s trailblazing short film, The Suit which stars father and son, John Kani and Atandwa continues to wow international audiences and film critics alike.The film was recently selected for the 25th Pan African Film Festival in Los Angeles from February 9-20.The festival is one of the largest gatherings of the African Diaspora and the biggest Afrocentric film festival in the world. The Suit is the first film adaptation of the classic South African short story by celebrated 1950s journalist and short story writer Can Themba. In recent months, the film has garnered a number of accolades locally and internationally.These include winning the Short Film Competition at the Africa in Motion Scotland African Film Festival in November 2016. It also scooped the Audience Award at the Cape Town leg of the Shnit International Short Film Festival in October. The film made it to the official selection of the Oscarqualifying Urbanworld Film Festival in New York in September.The film s director, Jarryd Coetsee, said he was humbled by the recognition the film had been receiving from international audiences and critics. I m delighted that The Suit has been selected for the Pan-African Film Festival from February 9-20 in Los Angeles presenting us with the extraordinary privilege to share his powerful story about the devastating impact of oppression on personal relationships in a city renowned for its diversity, and freedom. The story remains relevant today in many parts of the world where oppression is either blatant or insidious,more so than when it was first published in the 1960s. I look forward to communicating this story s transformative message with another foreign audience and believe that it will resonate as profoundly as it has done in South Africa. It is a testament to the sterling work of our cast and crew, Coetsee said.-Siyabonga Sithole|siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
