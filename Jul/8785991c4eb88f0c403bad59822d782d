THE Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) is deeply worried about the news that AngloGold Ashanti has submitted a Section 189 notice detailing its intentions to retrench 8 500 workers. Cosatu national spokesperson Sizwe Pamla said in a statement that the decision by AngloGold validates the call by the federation for a job summit and a jobs plan to deal with the issue of ongoing retrenchments. This matter cannot be left in the hands of the workers and employers at a shop floor. It has now reached a crisis situation. Hopefully the ANC Policy Conference can address the issue of retrenchments and job creation, particularly in the mining sector, Pamla said.The trade union said it also wants the ongoing conference to deal with the policy of controlling and putting strategic commodities such as gold, platinum and steel under government control.On Friday, Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane instructed the Minerals and Petroleum board to verify whether the information provided by AngloGold Ashanti that it plans to retrench more than 8 500 workers took into consideration industry commitments to save jobs. In a statement, the minister has appealed to Africa s biggest gold mining company to act responsibly and with sensitivity.AKANI MANGENA
