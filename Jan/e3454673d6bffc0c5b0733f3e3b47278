With cross-border crime a major concern in the Manguzi area on the KZN-Mozambique border, police have warned residents against carrying large sums of cash.This is after a local businessman was robbed of R200000 in the area a few days ago. We once again appeal to the community, including businesses, not to transport large sums of cash, KZN police spokesperson Lt-Col Thulani Zwane said. Businesses are requested to use other alternative and safer methods of banking their money. Business owners should not keep cash at home either as it is not safe to do so. The 47-year-old businessman was getting out of his vehicle when he was confronted by two men armed with pistols. The suspects took the cash from him and fled the scene on foot. A case of armed robbery was opened at Manguzi police station for further investigation, Zwane said.Security was recently beefed up following an escalation of crime in the area where criminal gangs from Mozambique are said to be terrorising the community. The gangs steal items including vehicles, which they smuggle into Mozambique through the porous border.Last year, Minister of Police Nkosinathi Nhleko visited the area when local residents had threatened to attack Mozambicans living in the area after accusing them of being behind a wave of criminal activity.The escalation of crime in the area resulted in the provincial department of community safety stepping up anti-crime initiatives in the Umkhanyakude district, which includes Manguzi.The provincial government is raising R128m for the construction of a barrier stretching 25km along the border.Clive Ndou
