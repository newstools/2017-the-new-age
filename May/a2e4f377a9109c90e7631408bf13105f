A MEETING of the ANC s national executive committee (NEC) ended yesterday with President Jacob Zuma appearing to have staved off another motion of no confidence in him.A Cabinet minister, who is also a Zuma ally in the NEC, told The New Age yesterday that despite a motion of no confidence in Zuma having been tabled, no decision had been taken to remove the president from office at the meeting in Irene outside Pretoria. We ve agreed before that it s not an issue of the NEC, it does not have the powers. It was raised by some people but there was no support. The NEC does not have the powers to recall the president, its that simple.We can t do something that is un-ANC. Despite Zuma s dissenters having been emboldened by the push back over his Cabinet reshuffle in April, the minister poured cold water on Zuma s detractors being one up on him. Why must the country get excited, there is no war, the source said. The meeting yesterday underscored the debate over the ANC s NEC having constitutional powers to recall Zuma. This after NEC member Joel Netshitenzhe tabled the motion against Zuma, arguing that Zuma s presidency was insidiously diminishing the ANC s chances of retaining power in the 2019 general elections.But MKMVA chairperson Kebby Maphatsoe fired back, saying Zuma s removal from office would be irrational as he was only months away from finishing his term.ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said at the weekend a letter authored by a group of ANC stalwarts and veterans calling on the ANC s highest decision making body to recall Zuma, was not a matter for the ANC NEC to discuss. When you sign an open letter, it s not a correspondence for the ANC, it s an open letter to the public. You can regard it as lobbying for members who want to use the letter in the discussion but it s not an item here. BONOLO SELEBANO
