The world&#8217;s biggest smartphone maker Samsung blamed faulty batteries on Monday for the fires that led to last year&#8217;s humiliating recall of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 device.Internal and independent investigations &#8220;concluded that batteries were found to be the cause of the Note 7 incidents&#8221;, the South Korean company said in a statement. The giant conglomerate was forced to discontinue the smartphone &#8212; originally intended to compete with Apple&#8217;s iPhone &#8212; after a chaotic recall that saw replacement devices also catching fire.The debacle cost the company billions in lost profit and reputational damage.&#8221;We sincerely apologise for the discomfort and concern we have caused to our customers,&#8221; Koh Dong-Jin, the head of Samsung&#8217;s mobile business, told reporters in Seoul.Samsung acknowledged that it provided the specifications for the batteries, adding in its statement: &#8220;We are taking responsibility for our failure to ultimately identify and verify the issues arising out of battery design and manufacturing.&#8221;We have taken several corrective actions to ensure this never happens again.&#8221;It deployed around 700 researchers and engineers on its investigation, testing more than 200,000 fully-assembled devices and more than 30,000 batteries, it said. Samsung announced a recall of 2.5 million units of the oversized Galaxy Note 7 in September 2016 after several devices exploded or caught fire, with the company blaming batteries from a supplier, widely believed to be its sister firm Samsung SDI.When replacement phones &#8212; with batteries from another firm, largely thought to be Chinese manufacturer ATL &#8212; also started to combust, the company eventually decided to kill off the Note 7 for good. The fiasco took a major toll on the reputation of the firm, which is set to announce fourth-quarter and full-year results on Tuesday.It promised to reform its production and quality controls to prevent a similar crisis, and said Monday: &#8220;The lessons of the past several months are now deeply reflected in our processes and in our culture.&#8221; Samsung shares were up 0.5 percent at 1.87 million won in Seoul on Monday morning after the announcement.Samsung&#8217;s English-language Samsung statement referred only to Galaxy Note 7 &#8220;incidents&#8221; but in Korean it spoke of &#8220;damage by fire&#8221;.-AFP
