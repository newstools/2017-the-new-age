MACASSAR community members have welcomed the city of Cape Town s initiative of installing ceilings in their old RDP houses.Some 3 451 households in Macassar, Chris Nissen, Heinz Park, Gordon s Bay, Phumlani, Silver City and Sir Lowry s Pass Village are set to benefit from the R60m project.The aim of the project is to install ceilings in old state-subsidised houses commonly referred to as RDP houses which were constructed years ago.The project, earmarked to start on February 27 and be concluded in June, will also repair roof leaks and safer ceiling lights. Between 1994 and 2005 the majority of state housing units were constructed without insulated ceilings and weatherproofing, because the previous national government subsidy did not make provision for this, the city said.Late in 2005 the housing subsidy was increased to provide ceilings, weatherproofing and partitioned bedrooms.In Cape Town alone about 50 000 state-subsidised houses did not have ceilings. Nonkosi Sigwaba, a resident in Macassar described how the leaks on her roof damaged her house since she moved in 12 years ago. From the day I moved in here I don t know how many times I have I tried to fix this house without any luck. I am sure that everybody here welcomes the initiative because people spend money to fix their houses with cheap material just to block water from coming in. It s good because the city will come with people who know how to fix our houses, Sigwaba said.City mayoral committee member for transport and urban development authority Brett Herron said the project was more than just the installation of ceilings. It s about improving the living conditions of our residents by contributing to their well- being so that they are able to enjoy the comfort of their homes with their families. The R60m investment is an exciting project because the city has the opportunity to directly make a difference in the lives of some of our most vulnerable residents, Herron said.MPUMI KIVA
