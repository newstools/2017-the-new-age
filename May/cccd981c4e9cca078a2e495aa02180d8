Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela feels he deserves another chance at the club to prove himself in a third season after two fruitless years. Chiefs finished fourth this season with 50 points and also finished empty handed.With club chairperson Kaizer Motaung showing his support for the coach by saying there are no plans to fire him, Komphela feels things didn t go according to plan this season and need another year to prove himself. I don t think when you are at Chiefs and you finish second is good enough, no. I cannot bring any excuses, I just have to accept the status quo and try to rectify things, Komphela said. If you look at the Telkom Knockout match against Free State Stars in Durban on a rainy day, we played beautiful football and their goalkeeper Thela Ngobeni was man of the match. We missed out in penalties. And you come to Nedbank as well in extra time we got a penalty and we missed it, which denied us that semifinal spot. In the league, those 18 points we gave away in eight matches. Losing and drawing matches in the last minutes and when you look at it, you can say we can do better. Chiefs, however, did end their season on a high note with a 1-0 victory over newly crowned Bidvest Wits on Saturday thanks to Gustavo Paez s late goal. Komphela believes that there are areas which the club will need to rectify during the offseason if they are to win something next season. There are areas where I felt we were a bit thin and there are certain things where I think as a team if we had to rectify the mistakes of this season need to be done, Komphela said. But that can be done after our audit, clearly there are quite a few things that need to be rectified. In relation to the market, coaches have to be careful because you don t start saying things before they are done. We need to rectify certain things, without sending a message that we are going to buy this player or that. -NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
