Italy recovered from going a goal and a man down to beat Zambia 3-2 in extra time and set up an Under-20 World Cup semi-final against England on Monday.Things looked bleak for the Azzurri, who had gone behind to Patson Daka&#8217;s early goal, when Giuseppe Pezzella was sent off for a shove following a video review just before half-time.But Riccardo Orsolini scored five minutes after the restart and even when Fashion Sakala struck in the 84th minute, substitute Federico Dimarco&#8217;s 88th-minute free kick sent the game into extra time.Kenneth Kalunga narrowly missed after skilfully juggling the ball past Italy&#8217;s defence, before another Italian substitute, Luca Vido, headed the decisive goal from a Dimarco corner in the 110th minute.The late strike finally knocked out Zambia, who stunned Germany in the round of 16, and sent last year&#8217;s U19 European finalists into a meeting with England, who downed Mexico 1-0.Dominic Solanke, who is Liverpool-bound after coming through the ranks at Chelsea, scored just after half-time but England had to survive a nervy finish when Josh Onomah received his second yellow card with 18 minutes left.Thursday&#8217;s other semi-final will be between Uruguay, who edged Portugal 5-4 on penalties, and Venezuela, who beat the United States 2-1 after extra time in another tight game on Sunday.-AFP
