DURBAN businessman and philanthropist Vivian Reddy has pledged his support for Childline KZN when he was presented with a gift from the organisation on his 64th birthday. During celebrations for the owner of Edison Power, Childline KZN honoured him for his contribution and work which has saved the NGO from closure due to lack of finances. Childline KZN s operations manager Adeshini Naicker said over the years Reddy s donations had contributed significantly towards managing the organisation s Crisisline, which receives more than 20000 calls each month. As a thank you, the NGO presented Reddy with a personalised framed collage highlighting the projects that had been successfully undertaken through his contributions. I am pleased and heartened by this wonderful gift which strengthens my resolve to continue serving. The personalised birthday greeting from the people I support goes to show that our efforts put into this organisation are appreciated. This is what makes my heart smile, Reddy said. He has been a donor to Childline KZN for more than five years. The celebrations for his birthday were held at Reddy s Edison Power offices in La Lucia Ridge and were also attended by his wife Sorisha Naidoo. After receiving his gift Reddy pledged further financial support for the organisation which saves lives. We will continue to support Childline because of the belief that it is in our power to ensure that our children become future leaders, Reddy said. He also applauded the great work done by Childline KZN and committed himself to continue his support. TNA REPORTER
