Premier Willies Mchunu and members of the provincial executive council will converge on Durban from today for a three-day lekgotla.Mchunu has invited heads of departments, CEOs of public entities, mayors and senior government officials to be part of the gathering that will conduct a mid-term review on the performance of government and plan further programmes for two years ahead. This lekgotla will reflect on the work of government since 2014.Ahead of the national general elections in 2014, we visited many parts of the province and interacted with many citizens. With the high voter turnout of 75.98%, the people demonstrated that they respected and understood all the processes of a democratic country, Mchunu said. The meeting, he said, will afford the provincial government an opportunity to have honest and open discussions around issues of service delivery and will lay the foundation for the state of the province address scheduled to take place on March 1. After this lekgotla, we will be inviting members of the public to make an input into the state of the province address. We want citizens of this province to tell us what they want us to do in order to create a prosperous KZN, Mchunu said.-TNA Reporter|provinces@thenewage.co.za
