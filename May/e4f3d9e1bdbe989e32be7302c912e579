Rapper Eminem launched court action against New Zealand&#8217;s ruling political party on Monday, accusing it of using an unlicensed version of his hit &#8220;Lose Yourself&#8221; in a campaign advert.Lawyers for the US artist told the High Court in Wellington that he never gave the National Party permission to use the song, which featured in the 2002 movie &#8220;8 Mile&#8221;.Barrister Garry Williams said National breached the copyright of Eight Mile Style, Eminem&#8217;s publisher, by using the tune in a 2014 election television commercial.Williams said the Detroit rapper&#8217;s hit was &#8220;iconic&#8221;, having won an Academy Award, two Grammys and critical acclaim.He said that meant rights to the work were &#8220;enormously valuable&#8221; and were strictly controlled by the publisher, which had rarely licensed them for advertising purposes.Williams said the song, which topped the charts in 24 countries, dealt with &#8220;the idea of losing yourself in the moment and not missing opportunities in life&#8221;.&#8220;That&#8217;s why the song appeals to both the public and those who wish to influence the public by using it in advertising,&#8221; he said.No details were immediately revealed of what damages Eminem was seeking.National&#8217;s lawyers are set to argue the tune they used, &#8220;Eminem-esque&#8221;, was a generic track that was part of a library bought from production music supplier Beatbox.They are expected to contend that any copyright infringement was accidental.The conservative party&#8217;s campaign director Steven Joyce dismissed Eminem&#8217;s claim when the row erupted in 2014.&#8220;We think it&#8217;s pretty legal, I think these guys are just having a crack,&#8221; he told reporters at the time.The judge-only hearing is scheduled to take six days.-AFP
