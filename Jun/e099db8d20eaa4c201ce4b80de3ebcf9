These tweets don&#8217;t mean an organisational decision has been taken . So there&#8217;s nothing really to them,&#8221;&#8220;Mbalula was just expressing his right to freedom of peace,&#8221; said Bulwane.Bulwane added that the ANC FS is not worried about who says what and where it&#8217;s said and that everyone in ANC has a right to air their own feeling.&#8220;it&#8217;s only a worry when it&#8217;s an organisational thing,&#8221; he said.Meanwhile, on Tuesday the ANC Youth League pronounced Magashule as its candidate for Secretary General while Mbalula himself has been nominated as Deputy Secretary-General after the league called for the creation of a dual position of ANC deputy secretary-general for organising and campaigns and monitoring and evaluation.The MK Military Veterans Association(MKMVA) has also endorsed Magashule.-TNA Reporter
