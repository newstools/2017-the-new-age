In an effort to make game farming more inclusive, the Eastern Cape Parks and Tourism Agency introduced its game transformation policy.Communications and media manager Oyanga Ngalika said the agency was responsible for the management of the provincial protected area network under the department of economic affairs, environment and tourism.She said the agency was also thus mandated with the implementation of the national biodiversity economy strategy in the province. This game wildlife programme has made available a total of 260 animals, valued at R3m. These animals include the highly valued Cape buffalo, bontebok and black wildebeest to mention a few, she said.Those set to benefit include local property owners and land claimant settlement communities who are supported by the national Department of Environmental Affairs to improve infrastructure for the purpose of handling their game allocations.An invitation for expression of interest for the game farming transformation initiative was published and a total of 21 applicants were received.The responses comprise 19 of the targeted previously disadvantaged individuals and two were institutions like the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University and Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife that offered their support for the initiative. Of the total applicants, nine had land ownership with verifiable title deeds, three relied on communal land while seven relied on land leased from the government.The applicants with the leased land were divided into 50% longterm leasing of more than 25 years and 50% short-term leasing of less than 10 years, she said.The programme aims to assist wildlife game farmers by providing scientific advice, strategic planning support and initial animal introductions.Both the provincial policy and strategy were developed and aligned to the national biodiversity economy strategy.These strategic plans and approaches take into consideration different aspects of the biodiversity and socio-economic background of the people of the Eastern Cape.The three important pillars of the biodiversity economy strategy are an economic transformational role, sustainable use of biodiversity and fair and equitable sharing of the benefits of the natural capital.Ngalika said local wildlife sectors have begged for a transformational approach in order to move away from the less inclusive South African past. Within this sector, significant investment in land availability as well as infrastructure is required to properly position these wildlife game farmers, she said.The agency will soon officially launch and hand over of these animals for the game transformation programme at Krompoort farm in Aliwal North.LONDEKA DLAMINIprovinces@thenewage.co.za
