The Momentum Proteas women&#8217;s squad is to play India, Zimbabwe and Ireland in a one-day international quadrangular series in Potchefstroom, Cricket South Africa announced on Tuesday.&#8220;It&#8217;s been a long road for the team to get here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had a few ups and downs this past season, culminating in our successful qualification for the World Cup. We&#8217;ve yet to announce the squad that will go to England so the players have this one last chance to impress the selectors and secure their places ,&#8221; said coach Hilton Moreeng .The two cricketers getting their caps for the first time are Raisibe Ntozakhe and Nadine de Klerk.Moreeng said they are looking forward to three cashes to prepare them ahead of the ICC Women&#8217;s World Cup that will be held in June in England.&#8220;We&#8217;ll be using this series as our last chance at ironing out any last-minute creases that we might spot ahead of the World Cup. The inclusion of Raisibe (Ntozakhe) and Nadine (de Klerk) just goes to show that the opportunities are there, one only needs to step up and grab them when they come. I&#8217;m really excited to see what these two youngsters have to bring into the side,&#8221; he said.Meanwhile the Proteas women&#8217;s captain, Dan van Niekerk, is determined to get the squad together to prepare for the clashes.&#8221;It&#8217;s been a bit of a gap between international series for us and I&#8217;m really keen to get going,&#8221; Van Niekerk said.&#8220;Having a quadrangular series as a way to prepare for the World Cup is really exciting and is definitely going to go a lot further than any number of training camps that we may have had instead,&#8221; she saidThe team will gather for a camp in Potchefstroom on 1 May to prepare for the 14-match, one-day international quadrangular series that take place between 7 and 21 May 2017 .-TNA Reporter
