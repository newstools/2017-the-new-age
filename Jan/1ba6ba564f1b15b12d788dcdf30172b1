Kaizer Chiefs Lorenzo Gordinho, Ryan Moon, Emmanuel Letlotlo and Siyabonga Ngezana have the opportunity to train with England Championship outfit Fulham this month.The foursome flew to England on Monday and are expected to be there for 10 days to show the London club Fulham what they are capable of. Chiefs football manager Bobby Motaung confirmed that their trip was part of a project to forge ties with top clubs around the world. This is part of the development plan, to expose our players to advanced European setups, Motaung said. Part of the trip is to explore future possibilities and forge ties with other clubs. It is important for exchange programmes to do so. For the youngsters, this is a lifetime opportunity to have a look and feel of the European setup. We are confident that they will return with a broader view that will contribute massively to their growth and development. However, work permit rules in the UK mean that it would be nigh on impossible for Moon, Ngezana and Letlotle to land deals in England even if they manage to impress at Fulham.They are both not regulars at Chiefs as they play most of their football in the Diski Challenge, but it is an opportunity to gain invaluable experience.Things could be better for Gordinho due to his Portuguese passport and he could land a deal should he impress. Gordinho, a product of Amakhosi s development structures, is a regular in the first team.Moon and Letlotlo have made cameo appearances in the first team, while Ngezana has made the first team s substitute bench and is playing a starring role in Chiefs Diski Challenge this season. The quartet will return to Naturena on January 12 to prepare for the PSL league s second round, with Amakhosi next in action against Free State Stars at FNB Stadium on February 7.Chiefs will be looking to start the year on a positive note when they resume after back-to-back victories that ended at the Christmas break.NEVILLE KHOZA| nevillek@thenewage.co.za
