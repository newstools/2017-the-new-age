Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) says airport levies will be cut by 35.5% from April, a move welcomed by the travel industry.&nbsp;This follows the promulgation of new permissions published in the Government Gazette in December, which set out aircraft landing fees, aircraft parking fees and passenger service charges that Acsa may levy, as determined by the independent industry regulating committee. The changes will see a reduction in airport charges of 35.5% for the 2017-18 financial year. These charges will then rise by 5.8% in the 2018-19 financial year and 7.4% in the 2019-20 financial year. The new passenger service charges, with prior year fees in brackets and including VAT, are: Passenger service charge per departing domestic passenger: R82 (R127); Per passenger departing for Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia or Swaziland: R169 (R263); and Per international passenger: R223 (R346). Aircraft landing fees and aircraft parking fees vary according to the maximum take-off weight of an aircraft and length of stay. Both sets of charges vary further according to whether the flight originated within South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana or Swaziland or outside of these territories. FlySafair celebrated the news yesterday, saying: This is not only a great testament to Acsa but excellent news for South African flyers and the economy as a whole. Kirby Gordon, head of sales and distribution at FlySafair, said: Overall pricing of tickets is a complex issue where we need to consider a number of factors, including the oil price and the strength of the rand. That said, the decrease in these tariffs is great and is a saving that we will most certainly seek to pass on to our customers. Website CheapFlights recently said South Africa travellers were now enjoying lower airfares. MD Andrew Shelton said fares were down as much as 15% on both domestic and international flights.
