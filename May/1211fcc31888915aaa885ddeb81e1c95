I seen I had a gift and I didn&#8217;t take it for granted. And I still don&#8217;t even at 32.&#8220;I been in this league for 14 years. I had some great teammates, I been in the postseason for 12 straight years so those guys and coaches I had put me in positions to be successful.&#8220;When you hear a name like Kareem who has done so many great things, winning championships in the 1980s and how many points he put up. I didn&#8217;t actually get a chance to watch him growing up but I read about his accomplishments, so it is pretty cool.&#8221;James has been enjoying a superb playoff, averaging 33.2 points, 9.8 rebounds, 8.0 assists, and 2.6 steals per game coming into Wednesday.Those number are actually higher than his regular season totals of 26.4 points, 8.6 rebounds, 8.7 assists, and 1.2 steals per game.James is seventh in regular-season scoring with 28,787 points while Abdul-Jabbar is first with 38,387 points.-AFP
