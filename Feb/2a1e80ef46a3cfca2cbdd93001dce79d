Some could look at Pitso Mosimane s reasons on why he changed his line-up for their surprising Absa Premiership draw against Chippa United as mere excuses.Others might see them as necessary and give the Sundowns coach the benefit of the doubt as the Tshwane side are trying to succeed once again on the continental front.The Brazilians host TP Mazembe in the CAF Super Cup on Saturday and the former Bafana Bafana coach will have a fresh squad on the day. The Super Cup is contested by the winners of the CAF Champions League and the Confederation Cup champions.While Sundowns still went with a strong squad against Chippa, experienced players such as Percy Tau, Ricardo Nascimento, Khama Billiat, Anthony Laffor and Hlompho Kekana were rested and Thapelo Morena only played 38 minutes at Mdantsane.Mosimane said his biggest priority at the moment is facing a Mazembe side that has just signed new coach Thierry Froger, even though assistant coaches Pamphile Mihayo Kazembe and David Mwakasu will be leading the team on Saturday. We made nine changes because I saw the greasy field. I also have a cup final on Saturday, so what is my priority? Mosimane said. You have to prioritise. I m not saying this game against Chippa was not important but I m saying I have a CAF cup final that is important for the history of the club and for SA. How many times have we played against Chippa and how many times have we beaten them? Let s see when We play them on February 28. MMASEKEPE MATSEBANE |mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
