Pop star Katy Perry said her new single &#8216;Swish Swish&#8217; is an anthem for people who are being bullied.The song, which features Nicki Minaj, is widely believed to be about Katy&#8217;s nemesis Taylor Swift, who wrote &#8216;Bad Blood&#8217; about their feud.Although Katy did not confirm the Taylor connection, she admitted it is a retort to bullies.&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a great anthem for people to use whenever someone&#8217;s trying to hold you down or bully you. That&#8217;s kind of what this record is about, it&#8217;s just like a 360-degree liberation,&#8221; Katy, 32, told chat show host Jimmy Fallon.&#8220;&#8216;Chained to the Rhythm&#8217; was a political liberation, &#8216;Bon Appetit&#8217; was a sexual liberation, and now &#8216;Swish&#8217; represents the liberation from all the negative that doesn&#8217;t serve you.&#8221;-This article first appeared on Times of India
