Facebook said Wednesday it would add 3,000 people to screen out violent content as the social media giant faces scrutiny for a series of killings and suicides broadcast on its platform.&#8220;If we&#8217;re going to build a safe community, we need to respond quickly,&#8221; chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said on his Facebook page.&#8220;We&#8217;re working to make these videos easier to report so we can take the right action sooner &#8212; whether that&#8217;s responding quickly when someone needs help or taking a post down.&#8221;The 3,000 new hires, added over the coming year, will increase by two thirds the size of Facebook&#8217;s community operations team, which currently numbers 4,500.-AFP
