THE ANC Youth League yesterday moved to allay fears of possible violence at the funeral of the slain former youth league secretary-general Sindiso Magaqa.This came amid concerns of a possible clash between leaders of the ANCYL and the EFF, with Julius Malema having vowed that he would attend the burial whether the ANC liked it or not.ANCYL secretary-general Njabulo Nzuza told reporters in Johannesburg yesterday that while Malema was welcome to attend, he promised that Magaqa s funeral would not be reduced to a battlefield as tensions between his ANC colleagues and EFF supporters continued to rage. We would like to reaffirm that there will not be any fights, we call for maximum discipline of all people who are going to attending the funeral of comrade Sindiso Magaqa, Nzuza said. Malema recently claimed that Magaqa had intended to dump the ANC for the red berets.However, Nzuza yesterday rejected this and accused Malema of using Magaqa s death to gain political mileage. We have not heard anything about comrade Magaqa joining the EFF. I must make it clear. It is even worse when people use the name of Sindiso Magaqa to score cheap political points, he said. They have used what should be a very solemn occasion to seek relevance and cast doubt on cadre Magaqa s unflinching loyalty to the ANC, Nzuza said yesterday.Magaqa will be laid to rest in Umzimkhulu, KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday.BONOLO SELEBANO bonolos@thenewage.co.za
