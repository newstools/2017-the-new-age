The City of Cape Town is pleading to residents to use water sparingly. This is after the Dam level reached 40,4% . The Executive mayor of the City of Cape Town Patricia De Lille on Thursday said s aving water is not optional. We are in the midst of a severe drought. Dam levels are far too low at 40,4% as of Monday , yet our collective usage has not dropped, said De Lille. We all have to save water now to ensure that we have water over the long term, t oday we need to consider implementing Level 3B water restrictions because we are not reaching the intended water savings, she said. The City reported that the Area-Based Mayoral Committee Members and the Informal Settlements, Water and Waste Services Directorate will be working along with peace officers, law enforcement officers and councillors to help ensure usage targets are reached.The city&#8217;s plan also includes door-to-door visits, issuing more fines where applicable, installing water restriction devices where usage on properties continues to be high, and focusing strongly on education and awareness. We have received an additional R254 million from water sales due to sales volumes being higher than anticipated and the impact of the implemented 20% (Level 2) water restrictions on consumption patterns, said De Lille. But we can t use this money to buy more water. Because of your abuse, we will all suffer and Make no mistake, this is a serious situation that we must all work together to address urgently, said the Mayor. The city also plans on improving response times for repairing pipe bursts , promoting the use borehole water instead of drinking water for irrigation purpose offering and plumbing repairs for indigent households free of charge.
