MEDICINES destined for public hospitals and clinics have been stolen from the main pharmaceutical depot in Seshego outside Polokwane putting the lives of thousands of patients at risk. The racket, which involved pharmacy assistants and security guards, was exposed on Friday last week with the arrest of two suspects.Provincial health department spokesperson Thabiso Teffo said most of the drugs being stolen were schedule 6 medication. The suspects include guards working for a private security company at the entrances of the depot who connive with our officials, mostly pharmacy assistants.They take out boxes of medicines and put them together with those that have expired under the guise that the drugs were going to be disposed of, Teffo said. At the gate, the guard will only look at the expired drugs and give the vehicle carrying them the green light to pass while knowing that those not expired would be offloaded for collection. Once smuggled out of the depot, the drugs, which include ARVs, TB treatment, pills for psychiatric conditions and others are sold to unscrupulous syndicates which deliver to private pharmacies in Gauteng and other provinces, the department said. While some people are making money out of this theft, our patients are told that there are no medicines in clinics and hospitals. Our concern is that some of these drugs must be stored below room temperatures but theft syndicates disregard this and just sell them to pharmacies.People may be exposed to danger because they innocently buy from pharmacies without knowing that the drug has been compromised and obtained illegally, Teffo said.The department said it appeared that the theft had been going on for some time and the value of the stolen drugs could be estimated at R1.2m. On Monday, police spokesperson LtCol Moatshe Ngoepe, confirmed that two security guards had been arrested at the depot. More arrests are expected as police investigations continue.We have recovered some of the stolen drugs and appeal to anyone with information to inform police in strict confidence, he saidTNA Reporter &nbsp;
