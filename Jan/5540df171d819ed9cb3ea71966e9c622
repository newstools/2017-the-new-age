Diminutive Lauren Davis pulled off the biggest win of her career Saturday, collecting her maiden WTA title with a 6-3, 6-1 win over Ana Konjuh in the Auckland Classic final.It was third time lucky for Davis, who lost the two other finals she has made in her six years on the tour.At 1.57 metres (5ft 2in), Davis is one of the smallest players but she more than compensated for her lack of height with her speed around the court which left 19-year-old Konjuh struggling to place winners.The American broke Konjuh twice in the first set and three times in the second, finishing the match with her fifth break against the Croatian who is ranked 47 in the world, 14 places higher than Davis.AFP
