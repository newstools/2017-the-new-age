AS THE power supply continues to be interrupted in three municipalities in the province, Eskom has pleaded with them to do the right thing.Renosterberg, Ubuntu and Thembelihle municipalities are experiencing an electricity cut off due to their escalating debt, which goes up to billions of rands, owed to the power utility.Acting group CEO Matshela Koko said they are open for discussions with the affected municipalities in an effort to find an amicable resolutions. We are certain that we have gone beyond the prescribed processes by engaging various other stakeholders in an attempt to create awareness of the planned electricity interruptions, Koko said. In the end we are compelled to resort to this step in consideration of Eskom s financial sustainability. He said disconnections are regarded as a credit control measure to protect Eskom s financial position.The provincial government has also weighed in to assist the municipalities which are unable to pay up.Provincial department of cooperative governance, human settlement and traditional affairs (Cogta) spokesperson Xhanti Teki said the department would be convening a meeting with different stakeholders in the coming weeks to take stock of the resolution with Eskom.Cogta said Magareng, NamaKhoi, Emthanjeni, Tsantsabane, Dikgatlong, Siyancuma, Ka Garib and Siyathemba municipalities have made arrangements to avoid power cuts.However, Thembelihle, Ubuntu and Renosterberg have not yet entered into any agreement because of the ongoing discussion. We are hopeful that soon they will reach an agreement and all stated role players will continue to give support through the Eskom debt provincial task team, Teki said.He said a comprehensive report would be drafted and presented to the premier, executive council, Eskom debt national task team and provincial South African local government association.He said they have been hard at work talking to defaulting municipalities to resolve outstanding debt and proposed medium to long-term solutions. The main hurdle in this regard is the negative cash flow projections, municipalities do not collect enough revenue. The municipalities are urged to avail a portion of the equitable share from the national fiscus to Eskom as a way to reduce both current and arrears account. While the talks continue, the residents and business people will be without electricity during peak hours every day.Labour federations and political parties have slammed municipalities who failed to pay Eskom.Cogta Minister Des van Rooyen has urged municipalities to pay their debt to ensure that services are not hindered and residents are not left in the dark.tiisetsom@thenewage.co.zaTIISETSO MANOKO&nbsp;
