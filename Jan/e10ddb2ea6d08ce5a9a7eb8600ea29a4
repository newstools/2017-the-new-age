Russian teenager Daria Kasatkina put Angelique Kerber&#8217;s Australian Open preparations in a spin with a straight-sets upset win over the world number one at the Sydney International on Tuesday.The 19-year-old, ranked 26, underlined her huge potential with a confident performance to take out the German, 7-6 (7/5), 6-2 in a second-round match played in sweltering conditions.Only last week Kasatkina held a match point before going down to French Open champion Garbine Muguruza in the second round at the Brisbane International.While she continues her march, Kerber&#8217;s form is a concern ahead of next week&#8217;s opening Grand Slam of the year, having also lost to Ukraine&#8217;s Elina Svitolina 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in the quarter-finals of the Brisbane International last week.Kerber, who had a breakthrough 2016, winning two Grand Slams on her way to becoming world number one, struggled to find any rhythm and her usually strong forehand was astray.&#8220;I made too many mistakes and I was not actually feeling the ball, because the balls are flying here a little bit different than in Brisbane,&#8221; Kerber said.&#8220;So it was not so easy, but I will try to forget the match as soon as I can.&#8220;I will go in the next few days to Melbourne, and I will try to get ready there, trying to get the positive energy from last year.&#8221;Asked about her emotions after her biggest win yet, Kasatkina said courtside: &#8220;Difficult to explain because I beat the number one in the world and it doesn&#8217;t happen every day. I think I got some confidence.&#8221;Kasatkina will next play British world number 10 Johanna Konta, whose formidable serve troubled Australia&#8217;s Daria Gavrilova in a 6-1, 6-3 win.&#8220;I&#8217;m just happy I have accumulated a few matches already under my belt in the first few weeks of the season,&#8221; Konta said.It was a day of upsets in Sydney where temperatures sizzled around 36 Celsius (97 Fahrenheit), with defending champion Svetlana Kuznetsova and last year&#8217;s finalist Dominika Cibulkova both knocked out in the second round.World number nine Kuznetsova went out to Russian compatriot Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 7-5, 6-3 while Canada&#8217;s Eugenie Bouchard continued her return to form with a 6-4, 6-3 win over the sixth-ranked Cibulkova.Former Wimbledon finalist Bouchard, who has now won consecutive matches at a tournament for the first time since August, stretched her lead over Cibulkova to 4-1 head-to-head and will face Pavlyuchenkova in the last eight.&#8220;Any time you play one of the best players in the world it&#8217;s like a standard of where you&#8217;re at,&#8221; Bouchard said.&#8220;I have taken a couple of solid steps this week, but I&#8217;m far from where I want to be. Even though I won, to me, I could do a lot of things better.&#8221;World number 27 Pavlyuchenkova, who knocked out Australian number one Samantha Stosur in the first round, won in her first career meeting with Kuznetsova.Ninth-seeded Italian Roberta Vinci was another seed to fall, losing 6-2, 6-3 to veteran Barbora Strycova of the Czech Republic.Danish seventh seed Caroline Wozniacki ousted Yulia Putintseva 6-0, 7-5 and will next face Strycova.-AFP
