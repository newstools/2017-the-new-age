Parliament s workers have hailed as a small victory the institution s decision to allow its secretary Gengezi Mgidlana to go on special leave.Last Tuesday members of the National Education Health and Allied Workers Union demanded that Mgidlana, with whom it has been at loggerheads for months, be suspended by the end of the week.If not, workers threatened at a meeting, they would consider marching to his office to remove him. On Friday, Parliament s two most senior presiding officers, National Assembly speaker Baleka Mbete and National Council of Provinces chairperson Thandi Modise, announced that Mgidlana would go on leave from that day. It was announced that deputy secretary Penelope Tyawa would be the acting secretary to Parliament. This is not what we requested. We requested that he be suspended. We are not happy because this sends out the wrong message. Other workers have been suspended on allegations that were not as serious as the ones against Mgidlana, Nehawu branch chairperson Sthembiso Tembe said.However, he said yesterday, workers had been fighting their case against Mgidlana for two years. It s a small victory that can lead to a bigger one. We believe we have the evidence. In announcing the special leave, Mbete said that Migidlana wrote to the presiding officers on May 29, requesting special leave while allegations levelled against him by Nehawu were investigated. Mbete said Parliament s independent audit committee was investigating the allegations against Mgidlana. The independent audit committee, comprised external individuals in line with provisions of the Financial Management of Parliament and Provincial Legislatures Act, is expected to probe the allegations with the necessary swiftness and to report back to the officers, she said. Consistent with justice, the secretary to Parliament remains innocent until proven otherwise, Mbete said.DENNIS CRUYWAGENdennisc@thenewage.co.za
