The South African Poultry Association has taken contingency measures to ensure that the avian flu virus affecting Zimbabwe does not spread to the country. We ve got tasks for all of us. The most important thing is that we heighten surveillance. The best way is to ask farmers and the general public to report anything unusual. We are preparing pamphlets which will go out, Kevin Lovell, CEO of the South African Poultry Association, said yesterday. We are also arranging to take some samples of the affected sites in Zimbabwe and that will give us a better understanding of the situation. Last week, the South African government said it was banning the import of all poultry products from Zimbabwe with immediate effect. This was a result of avian flu, known as H5N8, which occurred at a commercial poultry farm in Mashonaland, Zimbabwe.The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said it was suspending the trade of live poultry, meat and table eggs. It is believed that 715 000 chickens have died as a result of the virus in the region.Botswana and Mozambique also announced last week that they were banning poultry imports from Zimbabwe. Despite the banning of all poultry imports, Lovell said his members were worried about the possibility of the deadly virus spreading to the country. We are going to be very cautious and make sure that it does not spread to South Africa. The virus can be spread by wild birds and there s a great possibility that ducks will fly south. No one can stop birds from flying, he said.Lovell said the virus could affect both commercial and backyard poultry. Economically, from the country s point of view, if it affects both sectors, it has a direct impact on food security and that s what members are worried about. From past experiences, the department knows this needs a joint effort between all the important stakeholders, led by the government, the Sapa CEO said.ZODIDI MHLANAzodidim@thenewage.co.za
