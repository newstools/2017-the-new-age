WITH the Proteas bowlers having impressed against Sri Lanka in the ongoing ODI series, the `selectors will have a headache over the decision on who to leave out ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy later this year in England. Kagiso Rababa, Dwaine Pretorius, Andile Phehlukwayo, Wayne Parnell, Chris Morris and Imran Tahir have all impressed against Sri Lanka as the Proteas won the series with two matches to spare.And with Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel likely to return in time for the Champions Trophy, this bodes well for South Africa in the tournament to have all their bowlers in form. Both Steyn and Morkel are on the mend as they work towards their comeback and their progress is understood to be pleasing. Morkel has been battling with a back injury that has kept him sidelined since July last year and he has only played one first-class match for his franchise, Multiply Titans.Morkel will be targeting the New Zealand tour next month to get his fitness back just before the Champions Trophy. Steyn has been out of action since breaking a bone in his shoulder during the Perth Test in November and was set to be sidelined for six months. He is also likely to be fit for the England tour just before the Champions Trophy which will also be staged in England. Both Morkel and Steyn will be hoping to be fit before the Champions Trophy, which will come as a bonus for the Proteas.The bowlers who performed well against Sri Lanka in the ODI series will also have the opportunity to impress the selectors again during the New Zealand tour. With the Proteas continuing to experiment with the series done and dusted, they will be looking to do the same in their final match in Centurion on Friday.nevillek@thewage.co.za-Neville Khoza
