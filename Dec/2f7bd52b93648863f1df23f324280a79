Johannesburg – born actor Frank Opperman and popular TV presenter Thembisa Mdoda were announced as the first celebrities to join M-Net’s glitzy new series, Dancing With The Stars SA. The show, in which 12 untrained local celebrities will put their best foot forward with the help of highly-skilled professional Latin and Ballroom dancers, will commence on M-Net channel 101 on February 4. With the gleaming dance floor only a matter of weeks away, these celebrities will no doubt already be dusting off their dancing shoes in preparation for the daunting but exciting task
ahead. “I have always wanted to be part of Dancing With The Stars,” an excited Thembisa, who clinched the coveted title of Best TV presenter at the 2017 DStv Mzansi Viewers’ Choice awards, said when she heard the news. “In the past, I’d watch the show, practice the steps and give myself 10 out of 10. I am so excited and can’t wait to make new memories. Mostly, I’m eager to learn some new steps and to have fun.” In Opperman’s signature witty style, he said of joining this star-studded show: “Some people climb Everest for fun. Some walk to the South Pole for kicks, some people swim the seven oceans for pleasure and some people dance with the stars because they have gone insane. “In my case, it feels like all of the above in one go,” he admitted.
