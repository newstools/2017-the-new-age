German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Tuesday she was prepared to &#8220;consider&#8221; new French President Emmanuel Macron&#8217;s proposals for a shake-up of the eurozone.Speaking to business leaders, Merkel said &#8220;we could of course consider a common finance minister, if the circumstances are right,&#8221; citing one of Macron&#8217;s frequently touted ideas.&#8220;We could also consider a euro-budget if it is clear that we are really strengthening the structure of the economy and doing sensible things,&#8221; she added, backing another suggestion by the French leader.-AFP
