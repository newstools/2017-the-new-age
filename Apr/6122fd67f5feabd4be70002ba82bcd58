Firefighters battled a raging blaze that threatened to raze the building that houses the South African National Blood Service (SANBS) in Braamfontein.The flames and black plumes of smoke filled the Johannesburg city skyline yesterday.The SANBS said its blood supply was not significantly affected by the massive blaze at the Braampark office park.SANBS regional marketing manager Ivor Hobbs said the amount of blood at the offices was not enough to affect its running and no casualities were reported.City of Johannesburg emergency management services spokesperson Synock Matobako said the staff in the adjacent properties were evacuated. The roof of the building was destroyed and the fire hydrants around the vicinity did not have water. The cause of the fire is still being investigated. We found the building was occupied by SANBS and FNB employees. We searched through it and could confirm no one was injured or killed, Matobako said.There was speculation from eyewitnesses the fire was caused by a faulty generator on the top floor.A worker at the office park said she was on her lunch break when she noticed smoke coming from the roof. I don t know what they were doing. They were probably fixing the roof, but the next thing we saw was smoke, the woman said.KUTULLO MADISHA
