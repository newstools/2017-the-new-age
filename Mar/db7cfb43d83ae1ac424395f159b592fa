The South African Football Asoociation will announce the new Bafana Bafana coach this week.But just who it will be remains top secret. Top candidates Herve Renard and Carlos Queiroz have reportedly dropped out of the race this week, ahead of the announcement by SAFA.This leaves Hugo Broos as the only known frontrunner for the position. Broos&#8217;s name was mentioned from the very beginning and he has been seen as a strong contender against Renard and Queiroz.Though Broos has never confirmed his link to the vacant Bafana Bafana position, speculation has been rife that he could be the man heading to South Africa to take over the reigns. Broos has been in Zambia meeting with SAFA president Danny Jordaan, who&#8217;s attending the Under 20 AFCON.Broos is the current coach of Cameroon and recently led the Indomitable Lions to this year&#8217;s Africa Cup of Nations.He has won the prestigious Coach of the Year award four times in his career , and won the Belgian championship twice in 1992 and 1996 with Club Brugge. Could Broos be the man to take Bafana Bafana forward? He&#8217;s certainly qualified.Meanwhile reports coming from North Africa were that Herve Renard had resigned from his current job as coach of Morocco.His resignation further fueled speculation that he might have done that to take up the job as Bafana coach.But he has since dropped out of the race apparently.Carlos Queiroz has been locked into his contract by Iran and the Football Federation of that country is not willing to let him go.Queiroz took Iran to the world cup in Brazil in 2014, and his current contract with the Iran national team only expires next year.The Mozambican born coach is a former Bafana Bafana coach, having qualified them for the 2002 world cup in Korea and Japan.Safa was expected to announce the new coach last week but postponed the announcement, saying the designated coach was unavailable to attend the press conference.The new coach will have his hands full straight away, as he will be coming in to continue qualification for the 2018 FIFA world cup in Russia, in addition to the Africa Cup of Nations in 2019.-vutomi shiluvane
