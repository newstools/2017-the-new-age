The Minister of Police Fikile Mbalula has on Tuesday requested assistance of the South African National Defense Force (SANDF) in combating crime in two of the most crime stubborn provinces, Gauteng and Western Cape. Mbalula says levels of violence in recent months involved the use of weapons of war in the commission of serious crimes where even innocent bystanders and children had fallen victim of gang-related violent crimes. “When I visited the community of Elsies River, one community leader referred to the terror caused by gangs as an act of terrorism, I want to tell the people of Elsies River that I heard you, and I am acting,” Mbalula said that gangsterism in the two provinces is becoming a matter of huge concern. “Our children have a right to grow in a peaceful environment, and as police, we have a duty to protect that right,” Mbalula also indicated that it has been decided that urgent additional steps must be taken in order to inter-departmentally manage the current scourge of crime in general, drug-related offences and the negative impact this has on the community of the Gauteng and Western Cape Provinces. “We will never fail our people, we will squeeze the space for criminals, and we will liberate our people from prisons of fear,”  he said. -TNA Reporter
