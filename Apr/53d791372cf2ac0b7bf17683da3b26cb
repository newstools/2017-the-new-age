Communications Minister Ayanda Dlodlo has thrown her weight behind the SABC interim board, saying it was legally established. The board has been mandated to implement the SABC ad hoc committee recommendations and should be afforded the space to do its work. It is expected that the interim board should ensure the proper functionality of the SABC, Dlodlo said.This came as former SABC chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng lambasted interim board member, Krish Naidoo, for his testimony. Krish lied under oath. He is a sell-out. If the board which Krish was part of was unfit, why is he part of it? Motsoeneng said at his media briefing in Johannesburg yesterday. The ad hoc committee recommended that steps be taken against any former or present employees and board members found to have contributed to wasteful expenditure at the broadcaster.The committee also criticised Motsoeneng s undue influence on the previous board. Motsoeneng said that he was ready to face a disciplinary hearing at a date still to be announced. I m not apologetic about the decisions that I took at the SABC, he said.Last year, the Western Cape High Court ruled that Motsoeneng s appointment as the SABC s group executive of corporate affairs was irrational and unlawful and barred him from holding any executive position at the broadcaster until he had faced a disciplinary hearing.Meanwhile, the SABC says no decision had been taken to scrap the controversial 90% local content rule implemented by Motsoeneng.SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago yesterday said: Those who say it s been scrapped are speculating. The secretary of the Musicians Association of South Africa, Tebogo Sithathu, said that the policy was benefiting local musicians.Zodidi Mhlana
