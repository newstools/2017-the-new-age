Barcelona were handed a huge boost ahead of the second leg of their Copa del Rey semi-final home to Atletico Madrid on Tuesday as Sergio Busquets and Andres Iniesta were named in Luis Enrique&#8217;s squad.Busquets missed the last four games due to ankle ligament damage, whilst Iniesta hasn&#8217;t featured in nearly a month with a hamstring problem.Gerard Pique has also been passed fit despite coming off with a groin strain at half time in Saturday&#8217;s 3-0 win over Athletic Bilbao, but Neymar is unavailable due to suspension.Barca hold a 2-1 first-leg lead as they look to reach a fourth consecutive Copa del Rey final.-AFP
