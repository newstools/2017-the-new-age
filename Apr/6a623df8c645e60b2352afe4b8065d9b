The Competition Tribunal has given the for Council Medical Schemes (CMS) 20 business days to consolidate its pleadings in connection with two complaints it brought in 2013 against the South African Medical Association (Sama) and two other member organisations for price fixing.The tribunal also dismissed an application by Sama to have the two complaints dismissed. In the complaints brought by CMS it alleged that the 2009 medical tariffs determined by Sama allowed paediatricians to bill an extra 50% above the medical aid rate payable for newborn babies requiring intensive care. The CMS also complained about the 2010 billing guidelines of the Society for Cardiothoracic Surgeons of South Africa (SOCTSA).In each case the CMS alleged that the application of these tariffs amounted to prohibited conduct under the Competition Act. Sama asked the tribunal last year for an order dismissing CMS s complaints. The tribunal had ordered CMS to respond to Sama s exception applications through the filing of supplementary affidavits that, among others, indicate the nature of the alleged horizontal relationship between Sama and the South African Paediatricians Association and between Sama and SOCTSA.In the recent tribunal order, the tribunal has ordered, among other things, that CMS must elaborate on the recommendation and binding nature of Sama s publication. It also has to say why it s important for Sama to publish these guidelines and how it is able to achieve compliance with these guidelines by paediatricians andneonatologists. CMS needs to outline what mechanisms, if any, are utilised by Sama to punish non-compliance.-Sello Rabothata|sellor@thenewage.co.za
