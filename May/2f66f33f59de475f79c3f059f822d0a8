French anti-corruption police searched the homes of Paris Saint-Germain footballers Angel Di Maria and Javier Pastore as well as the club&#8217;s offices on Tuesday as part of an investigation into alleged financial offences, a source close to the probe said.The police operations were conducted as part of an investigation opened last December by the national financial prosecutors&#8217; office into alleged laundering of money acquired by fraud, the source said.According to the Mediapart internet site, the searches of the Argentinians&#8217; homes and PSG offices in Paris and Boulogne-Billancourt stemmed from media reports last December of large-scale tax evasion by football stars.That same month, a group of 12 European news outlets began publishing the results of months of investigations into millions of financial documents obtained by the German magazine Der Spiegel and dubbed the &#8220;Football Leaks&#8221;.-Reuters
