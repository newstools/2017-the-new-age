Germany is set to legalise same-sex marriage as early as this week, it emerged Tuesday, after an election-year shift on the issue by Chancellor Angela Merkel sparked a rapid push for a parliamentary vote.The reform would grant full marital rights, including being able to jointly adopt children, to gay and lesbian couples, who in Germany are now only able to enter so-called civil unions.Merkel, leader of the centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU), had long voiced personal reservations about such a change, citing concern about &#8220;the well-being of the children&#8221;.Last Sunday, her junior coalition partners and election rivals, the Social Democrats (SPD), upped the ante by declaring they would insist on same-sex marriage in any future alliance.Other political parties &#8212; the Greens, far-left Linke and pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) &#8212; agree, leaving only the CDU opposed, along with the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD).Merkel signalled her shifting position Monday in an on-stage interview with the editor of women&#8217;s magazine Brigitte.She said her thinking had changed after a &#8220;memorable experience&#8221; when she recently met a lesbian couple who lovingly care for eight foster children in her Baltic coast electorate.Merkel used a characteristically vague formulation to drop the bombshell news: &#8220;I would like to shift the discussion in the direction of a vote of conscience rather than imposing anything from the top.&#8221;Allowing lawmakers to vote according to their conscience, rather than having to tow the party line, is seen as a near-certain way to push through same-sex marriage, which polls say a large majority of German voters favour.&#8211; &#8216;No way back&#8217; &#8211;Merkel&#8217;s comment sparked a flurry of reactions on social media overnight, with the #EheFuerAlle (MarriageForAll) hashtag trending on Twitter, and the news dominated morning radio and TV bulletins.CDU lawmaker Stefan Kaufmann tweeted: &#8220;Thank you, Angela Merkel! How liberating! If it were up to me, we could have the vote this week!&#8221;The leader of the group of gay and lesbian lawmakers within the CDU-CSU bloc, Alexander Vogt, hailed Merkel&#8217;s comments as a &#8220;paradigm shift&#8221; and told AFP that &#8220;now there is no way back&#8221;.And the head of the federal anti-discrimination agency, Christina Lueders, said lesbians and gays &#8220;should not have to wait for many more months&#8221; for a decision.She said a survey by her office had found that 83 percent of Germans favour same-sex marriage.Several other lawmakers also urged a parliamentary vote before the Bundestag breaks for its summer recess Friday.The SPD&#8217;s top election candidate, Martin Schulz, then sought to recapture ownership of the issue and vowed to force a vote this week, with support of the Greens and Linke.The conservatives&#8217; parliamentary chief Volker Kauder angrily fired back that forcing a hasty vote amounted to a &#8220;breach of trust&#8221; between the coalition partners.Kauder left open whether in the event of a vote, his lawmakers could decide according to their conscience, as suggested by Merkel, telling journalists only that &#8220;we&#8217;ll see&#8221;.But shortly afterwards, news broke that Merkel had indeed told her party MPs they could decide freely on the issue.For the SPD, being seen to have forced Merkel&#8217;s hand would spell a badly-needed victory as it lags the CDU in opinion polls.But it would also deprive it of a key campaign issue, while Merkel could keep open all coalition options if the CDU emerges as the strongest party in the September 24 election.-AFP
