MAMELODI Sundowns failed in their quest to ascend to the top of the PSL table earlier this week. The defending PSL champions played Chippa United on Tuesday night but the match was stopped when power failure struck Loftus Versfeld and the match resumed after the 42nd minute was only completed yesterday with Sundowns and Chippa playing to a goalless draw.In all honesty, the 15 hour delay took a lot out of the players, resulting in a boring stalemate between the two sides in an encounter that never looked like producing any goals. For Sundowns, the draw meant two points dropped, resulting in a missed chance to climb to the summit of the log.While Pitso Mosimane would have loved to get maximum points from a match he dubbed a training game , the South African coach of the year said other teams would also drop points. We have to dig deeper now. This is the way football is. But even people who are fighting us for the league will have glitches here and there. We will cancel out each other, Mosimane said. We dropped points. The derby is always a draw, you know that. You can t guarantee SuperSport United and Wits will win their games. We will have to take what we can. We wish we could have been top of the log but we have another chance on Friday against City to go top, Mosimane said.Eric Tinkler s Cape Town City one of the league s hottest sides with the attacking trio of Lebogang Manyama, Lehlohonolo Majoro and Aubrey Ngoma, are next to face Sundowns. The match is to take place at Cape Town Stadium. Unlike with Chippa, who play similar football to Sundowns, Mosimane now has to come up with a plan for a City side that defeated Downs in the first round, with Manyama and Ngoma dominant throughout. Cape Town City will be a very difficult team. They have a good attack in Majoro, Ngoma and Manyama. We will have to test their defence as well. We played them in an awkward game after we went to Egypt and we lost, Mosimane said.mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za-Mmasekepe Matsebane
