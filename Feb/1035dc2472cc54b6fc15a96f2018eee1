Premier David Makhura has called on community leaders and political parties to stand up and speak out against senseless acts of violence against foreign nationals. We need to hear every voice against xenophobia. We cannot afford the repeat of events of past years where many foreign nationals were killed and displaced. Stand up and be counted, Makhura said. He was speaking at the launch of the premier s Social Cohesion Games on Saturday against the backdrop of recent xenophobic violence in Tshwane and Rosettenville. Through these games, we intend to unite all Gauteng residents against racism, xenophobia and all forms of prejudices that undermine nation building and social cohesion, Makhura said.He said the games would underline and highlight the divisive legacy of apartheid which sought to separate people especially Africans as part of the divide and rule policy to enable white rulers to keep their grip and oppress the black masses. The social cohesion games would also highlight how other African countries helped the liberation movements to overthrow the previous regime and gave refuge to anti-apartheid activists who were forced to flee the country by apartheid.The provincial government has roped in local soccer legends and those from fellow African countries who are resident in Gauteng such as William Okpara, Roger Fetumba, Kalusha Bywala, Timothy Bathabire, Innocent Chikoya, and Patrick Maverick.They will be joined by South African soccer legends Jomo Sono, Disco Makua, Doctor Khumalo, Brian Baloyi, Kennedy Makara, Thapelo Liau and Portia Modise.The Social Cohesion Games have drawn huge support from a wide spectrum of South African personalities from the sporting, missive, cultural and media fraternities. They have also drawn support from diverse communities in Gauteng. The tournament comprises social seven a side football games, which will see former footballers and players over the age of 35, playing qualifying games in all five corridors of the province. Given the theme of social cohesion, all regions will include a national team from various African countries as well as a team made up of different religions and nationalities that constitute the rainbow society of Gauteng, the premier said.He said soccer was a common denominator in Gauteng, on the continent and the world over and therefore had the capacity to unite people.Makhura said the games would be played in eight centres across Gauteng with 768 players from different African countries and 64 teams participating.The finals will be played on March 5.NTOMBI NKOSIntombin@thenewage.co.za
