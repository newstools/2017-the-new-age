Johannesburg transport MMC Nonhlanhla Makhubo has appealed to communities and motorists to always give emergency vehicles such as ambulances, fire engines and police cars, the right of way. These emergency vehicles could be on their way to save the life of a family member. Please do not deny these to your areas. Always assist them. They are at your service, Makhubo said. She also called on road users, particularly taxi drivers, to obey the rules of the road. Some taxi drivers have a tendency of deliberately flaunting the rules. In their illegal acts they end up causing accidents. Makhubo also advised children against playing in the streets saying more than 500 children died in car crashes daily around the world. Parents should ensure that children do not play in the streets but in parks, sporting grounds and open spaces. Roads and streets are for cars, not for playing in.Ride your bicycles on designated areas or at play parks, Makhubo said. She also appealed to residents to report potholes and dysfunctional streets lights timeously. Only by working together, the government and communities can make our streets and roads cleaner, more accessible and safe, Makhubo said.-Kutullo Madisha|kutullom@thenewage.co.za
