There are a number of huge challenges facing the global auto industry, but two of the biggest are reducing pollution and developing replacements for fossil fuel-powered vehicles for a more sustainable future. It has to be said it&#8217;s early days yet, but some scientists in Belgium have come up with a way of potentially killing both of these incredibly difficult birds with one stone.Scientists from the University of Antwerp and KU Leuven (University of Leuven) in Belgium have developed a device that uses light and a special catalyst to clean polluted air, but at the same time produces hydrogen that can then be used to power hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The device utilizes a process called, &#8220;heterogeneous photocatalysis,&#8221; which has been used previously to siphon hydrogen from water and nullify gas-based pollutants.However, it&#8217;s rarely been used to do both at once, but the team now appears to have managed it thanks to what&#8217;s called a &#8220;photoelectrochemical cell,&#8221; which makes use of solar cells to produce hydrogen in a similar way to electrolysis water-splitting.According to Professor Sammy Verbuggen, the two processes are performed in the one device in what are being referred to as two individual &#8220;rooms,&#8221; which are separated by a membrane to isolate them from each other. On one side of the device air is purified with a photoanode, while in the other side of the device hydrogen is generated from &#8220;a part of the degradation process&#8221; thanks to a cathode that&#8217;s been tucked behind the solid electrolyte membrane.The key to the team&#8217;s success so far is the choice of catalyst. Professor Verbuggen explains, &#8220;In the past, these cells were mostly used to extract hydrogen from water. We have now discovered that this is also possible, and even more efficient, with polluted air.&#8221;But before we get too carried away, the team is quick to point out this apparent wonder device is at a very early stage of development. They insist that what they have come up with so far is little more than a &#8220;proof-of-concept,&#8221; which they also admit has &#8220;ample room for improvement.&#8221; The device so far only measures a few square centimeters, so it&#8217;s hardly up to powering fleets of vehicles or counterbalancing our carbon emissions. Every exciting development has to start somewhere though, and this definitely looks to be very encouraging at least.-Relaxnews
