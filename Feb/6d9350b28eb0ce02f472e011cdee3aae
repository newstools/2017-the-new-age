BNP Paribas said Tuesday it had managed to expand net profits last year despite tepid global growth, but its shares slumped on a weak fourth quarter.&#8220;With 7.7 billion euros net income, BNP Paribas delivered a good performance in 2016 thanks to its integrated and diversified business model,&#8221; chief executive Jean-Laurent Bonnafe said in a statement.The French bank&#8217;s net profit, equivalent to $8.2 billion, was up by 15 percent from 2015 and makes for an average annual increase over the past three years of 6.5 percent.Revenue edged up by 1.1 percent to 43.4 billion euros &#8220;despite the low interest rate environment and a lacklustre market context&#8221; the bank said.Bonnafe also laid out plans for BNP Paribas to accelerate its shift from a bricks and mortar bank to offering clients more services online and set a target of an average annual increase in net profit of more than 6.5 percent through 2020.The plan aims to provide &#8220;a new customer experience, the acceleration of digital transformation and improvement of operating efficiency&#8221;.Some 3 billion euros in investments between 2017 and 2019 into transforming the bank are expected to result in 3.4 billion euros in savings during that period, and produce 2.7 billion euros in recurrent savings per year thereafter.All parts of the bank are to be impacted by the plan, including the branch network, which shrunk by more than 10 percent over the past four years.Revenues are targeted to increase by an average rate of 2.5 percent or higher.The plan also calls for paying out 50 percent of net earnings to investors in dividends.For 2016, the bank proposed a dividend of 2.70 euros per share, an increase of 16.9 percent from 2015.However the bank&#8217;s share price slumped by more than 4 percent in morning trading as investors were disappointed with the fourth quarter results.While net profits jumped 2.2 times from the same period in 2015 to 1.4 billion euros, that was from an exceptionally weak quarter and less than analysts had expected.&#8220;The fourth quarter 2016 results came in at less than expected and the outlook for the retail bank in 2017 was judged as a bit weak by the market,&#8221; said Daniel Larrouturou, deputy managing director at Paris-based fund manager Diamant Bleu Gestion.Shares in BNP Paribas were down 4.3 percent to 57.45 at 0907 GMT, while the Paris CAC 40 was essentially flat.Shares in other French banks were also down, with Societe Generale losing 2.5 percent and Credit Agricole off 2.0 percent.-AFP &nbsp;
