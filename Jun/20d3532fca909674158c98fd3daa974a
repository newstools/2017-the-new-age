BAROKA FC are a point away from defying the odds that were stacked against them by the history of the PSL promotion/relegation play-offs.Not many gave Baroka a chance to bounce back to the Absa Premiership through playoffs as the history of the mini-league is in favour of the National First Division teams. The Limpopo outfit went into the playoffs knowing that in the past 12 times it was only on three occasions that a PSL team managed to keep their top tier status via the mini-league.Mpumalanga Black Aces, AmaZulu and Polokwane City are the only side that managed to keep their top-tier status in the play-offs so far. Because of the history, many expected Stellenbosch FC or Black Leopards to join Thanda Royal Zulu in making the big step to the lucrative top tier.But this time it looks like Baroka will be the fourth side from the top tier to resist the notion as they are at the summit of the play-offs. Bakgaga defeated Stellenbosch 2-0 through goals from captain Olaleng Shaku and Mduduzi Mdatsane at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday.They are leading the group with seven points after three matches and enjoy a five-point gap between them and Stellenbosch who are out of the race whil Leopards are at the bottom with just a point from two matches.Though a point will guarantee them another run in the Premiership, Baroka can actually keep their status without even kicking a ball. Out of the race Stellenbosch host Leopards on Wednesday and if the Cape outfit defeat or hold Lidoda Duvha to a draw, Baroka will be promoted back to the big time.However, Baroka coach Kgoloko Thobejane is not hoping for any favours but looking forward to finishing off the work on Saturday when they visit Leopards. Going to Leopards we need more in terms of performance, better than we gave against Stellenbosch, Thobejane said. If you remember, our first game against them the first half was ours and Leopards were better in the second half. This time we want to play better than them in both halves of the match. sithembisod@thenewage.co.za-Sithembiso Dindi
