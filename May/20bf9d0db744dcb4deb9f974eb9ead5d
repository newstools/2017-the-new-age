Former world number one Maria Sharapova says she is not looking too far ahead after returning from a doping suspension but concedes she is eager to be competing for the biggest titles in tennis again.The 30-year-old beat Christina McHale 6-4 6-2 in the first round of the Italian Open on Monday to guarantee herself a spot in the Wimbledon qualifying tournament.She faces a battle to raise her ranking enough to qualify for the grasscourt grand slam by right and spare organisers the dilemma of whether to award her a wildcard into the main draw of the tournament she won in 2004.The Russian is returning from a 15-month doping ban after testing positive for the heart drug meldonium at last year&#8217;s Australian Open.Since her return in April, Sharapova has received wildcard entries to the Stuttgart, Madrid and Italian Opens.&#8220;I certainly have expectations of myself&#8230; when you have won big events and you have been No. 1 in the world, you know that feeling. So that feeling ultimately stays inside of you&#8230; and you know what you work for,&#8221; Sharapova told reporters.&#8220;I would love to experience those feelings again. Of course, that is my goal. But as I said, every week is important&#8230; I might have not played my best tennis, but I set up an opportunity to play another match and to hopefully improve in that match, and that&#8217;s what I need.&#8221;Sharapova also said that she was unaware of this week&#8217;s rankings deadline for the Wimbledon qualifying draw.&#8220;Oh, is it? See, I think maybe you guys assume that I know these things, but I genuinely want to take care of each and every single week, and every single match is a priority for me,&#8221; Sharapova said.&#8220;When you&#8217;ve been out of the game and haven&#8217;t played competitively in 15 months&#8230; The fact that I&#8217;m back and playing three weeks in a row now and three events in a row for me is a big deal. That&#8217;s my focus.&#8221; The five-time grand slam winner will find out if she receives a wildcard entry into this month&#8217;s French Open later on Tuesday.-Reuters
