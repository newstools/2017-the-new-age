The Zion Christian Church (ZCC) has called on its members to boycott publications Sunday World, Sowetan, Sunday Times, Business Day and other publications owned by Media Group Tiso Blackstar in protest against what it calls &#8220;gutter journalism.&#8221;ZCC, which is the largest African initiated church in Southern Africa says that these newspapers are on a mission to ridicule, defame and make a mockery of the church. The ZCC says these newspapers continue to ridicule it&#8217;s leader Dr Engenas Barnabas Lekganyane for fun and commercial reasons.&#8220;Please Masione do not buy the above mentioned newspapers,&#8221; said the church in a statement.The church quoted the Press Council&#8217;s code of conduct which states that, &#8220;media shall not allow commercial, political, personal or other non-professional considerations to influence or slant reporting&#8221;.&#8220;We firmly believe that Tiso Blackstar and Sunday World in particular have been found wanting in almost all of the above mentioned requirements.&#8220;While it would be ideal to take the Sunday World to the Press Ombudsman, the church has opted to pursue a different path: to use our collective buying power to protect our name protest against gutter journalism,&#8221; said the ZCC.The statement is in response to story in the Sunday World with the headline &#8220;ZCC bishop faces arrest&#8221;.The article alleged that aggrieved branches of the ZCC in Botswana were heading to the High Court of Botswana to have Bishop Barnabas Lekganyane arrested and the church sanctioned for contempt of court.However, the church says that it will continue on its mandate to spread the word of God.&#8220;As the ZCC, however, we will continue to spread the gospel of peace throughout the world and our doors remains opened to media houses that wish to work with us in a mutually-respectful manner.&#8221;Tiso Blackstar has not yet commented-TNA Reporter
