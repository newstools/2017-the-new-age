Jack Clifford has been recalled to an inexperienced England back row in place of Tom Wood for Saturday&#8217;s Six Nations international against Wales in Cardiff.Clifford, fit following a chest injury, has been called into the starting side by coach Eddie Jones while Wood, who has been struggling with a chest injury, is demoted to the bench.The only other change to the England starting XV that beat France 19-16 at Twickenham in the Grand Slam champions tournament opener is on the wing, with Jack Nowell replacing Jonny May after the latter was sin-binned against the French.May, like Wood, is now on the bench.England could find themselves up against a vastly experienced Welsh loose forward trio comprising three British and Irish Lions but Clifford, Maro Itoje &#8212; best known as a lock &#8212; and Nathan Hughes have just four back-row starts between them, while Wood has 46 caps.&#8221;Jack Clifford also deserves his starting role. He is a hard-working, young player,&#8221; Jones said in a Rugby Football Union statement.&#8220;He has got a good record against Wales, he had a superb game against them in May, he knows what he is going to expect from Wales and we&#8217;re looking forward to him making an impact to our back-row play,&#8221; the Australian added.&#8221;Tom Wood will also play his part later in the game off the bench as a finisher.&#8221;England are on a national record 15-match winning streak, just three short of equalling world champions New Zealand&#8217;s all-time tier one record of 18 successive Test victories.Wales are due to name their side later Thursday.England team to play Wales in a Six Nations international in Cardiff on Saturday (1650 GMT kick-off):England (15-1)Mike Brown; Jack Nowell, Jonathan Joseph, Owen Farrell, Elliot Daly; George Ford, Ben Youngs; Nathan Hughes, Tom Wood, Maro Itoje; Courtney Lawes, Joe Launchbury; Dan Cole, Dylan Hartley (capt), Joe MarlerReplacements: Jamie George, Matt Mullan, Kyle Sinckler, Tom Wood, James Haskell, Danny Care, Ben Te&#8217;o, Jonny May-AFP
