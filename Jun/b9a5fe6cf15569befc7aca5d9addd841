THE ANC Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) says the election of its national office bearers will not overshadow discussions about over policy matters during its national conference from Friday.MKMVA chairperson Kebby Maphatsoe said the national conference schedule to finish on Sunday, was more to prepare for the upcoming ANC policy conference than electing leaders. We see the upcoming conference first and foremost as an opportunity for MKMVA to discuss and analyse the current political environment in which we find ourselves and to debate various ANC policy documents to be presented by the ANC for the upcoming policy conference,&#8221;Maphatsoe said. We want to emerge with one voice, one MKMVA not afraid to speak on the ANC,&#8221; Maphatsoe said.The MKMVA leader today took a slight jab at its rival formation the MK Council claiming that they were the only official structure of former ANC military wing enjoying the blessing of the national executive committee (NEC).Leader of the MK Council Siphiwe Nyanda yesterday criticised what he described as MKMVA s unilateral push to convene a national conference.He said this week s conference would serve to sow disunity within the MK rank and file.However, MKMVA treasurer-general Des Van Rooyen hit back at their rivals. He claimed that they could not be equated to the council . The conference is meant to create a platform of participation. But remember the council is not a structure. It is made up of a group of disgruntled members,&#8221; Van Rooyen said.But the MKVA has extended an olive branch by allowing the council to have 30 of its members to participate in the conference.-TNA Reporter
