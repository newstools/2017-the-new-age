The situation was still tense yesterday at Diphale village outside Burgersfort where ongoing conflict over chrome mining led to the burning of houses and two tribal offices at kgosi Bethuel Mohlala s palace on Sunday.A large police contingent was patrolling the area. The total number of houses torched since Sunday are eight, including four belonging to community members involved in the conflict. The damage could be estimated at more than R5m, police spokesperson Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe, who was part of the group of police officers at the scene, yesterday said.However no arrests had been made at the time of going to press while Mohlala and other members of the royal family could not be immediately reached as they had gone into hiding.Villagers started turning against each other after local chrome mines allowed them to have a share in the selling of the mineral, according to sources. Numerous gangs of zama zamas and unscrupulous buyers have taken over the situation and recruited villagers on the side. It is now a scramble for the wealth of this village and unfortunately it is now fellow residents tearing at each other, a resident said on condition of anonymity.Illegal mining has become widespread in the area.Some zama zamas use sophisticated machinery while others use shovels to dig chrome ore and load it onto trucks which drive to neighbouring Mpumalanga and Gauteng where most syndicates are based, sources claimed.Police have confirmed the deadly disputes were largely fuelled by chrome ore but said their investigations were still under way.Last week, Andrew Kgopane, 36, was shot dead and a 40-year-old woman was assaulted and burnt to death together with her double cab bakkie, allegedly by rival groups.Provincial police commissioner Lt-Gen Nneke Ledwaba said: We are calling on people to desist from participating in these acts of vigilantism. Police will act mercilessly on anyone taking the law into their hands, Ledwaba said.MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
