Stripped of its political and economic connotations, what might the downgrade of South Africa s credit rating by the S&amp;P s Global Ratings mean to the ordinary folk or a common man and woman?It is difficult to know for certain what value the working class and the poor attach to the concept of this week s foreign currency sovereign currency downgrade by the rating agency a move that, in the words of Wits University associate professor of economics Chris Malikane, could in the long term lead to higher interest rates that could make it harder for families to pay for vehicles and their home loans .This is a telling comment, and could have different meaning for different communities. For communities cushioned by wealth and huge capital accumulated over many years of colonialism and apartheid, the news by the S&amp;P s Global Ratings to downgrade the country to junk status will have a different meaning as compared to how the under class or the poor react to the news.The national budget recently announced by former finance minister Pravin Gordhan is premised on the cornerstone of fiscal consolidation. This ought to be and is a non-negotiable imperative if the national Treasury is to stabilise the ratio of the government debt to GDP .In a nutshell, the Treasury is expected to show fiscal prudence and discipline if it is to maintain a tight monetary policy ship.Despite the volatile climate often accompanied by all kinds of political rhetoric, there has never been a demonstrable or overt inclination by the government for a policy shift that would suggest that the government would no longer commit to fiscal discipline.With this in mind, how should the poor and marginalised make sense of the decision by the rating agencies to downgrade the country to junk status? To the working class and struggling masses who live on the periphery the decision imposes a heavy burden in which poverty and unemployment will in all probability escalate.With this in mind, the already crime-ridden country, given the economic squeeze that will result, it is logical to expect that the socioeconomic situation of the marginalised will worsen and that the country will be more susceptible to more poverty and less employment opportunities and more crime and death.Does this solve the problem, even if the intention may be to punish the government? It seems that to be downgraded to junk status may just worsen the situation with the junk status imposing on the country unintended consequences for the poor more than it would for the wealthy.For the underclass it might well be a case of double jeopardy brought about as a result of structural poverty inherent in a system that had previously discriminated against blacks.The punitive measure by the rating agencies will simply worsen the economic woes experienced by the poor and may even lead to more crime, what with millions of people facing the prospects of losing their jobs.It is for that reason that the recent comments by a black businessman Thami Mtshali in response to the decision to downgrade the country to junk status are instructive, if not illuminating the dark alleys on which the agencies may be travelling and not having a full appreciation of what impact the implications the credit rating downgrade might have on the country s financial assets.Mtshali, who is the chief executive of Galela Holdings, said: As a businessman I have seen the South African economic landscape undergo a phenomenal transformation in the past 22 years. This transformation has included milestone developments that leave me perplexed as to why there is a looming downgrade to bond status. He then supports his assertion by citing progress that has taken place in the country, which includes, as he writes, the budget increasing almost tenfold from R100bn to R1trillion, the remarkable rise from R700bn to more than R5 trillion in the market capitalisation of the JSE .There are a myriad of positive stories about progress and development already scored by South Africans from all walks of life and ideologies, despite the many political difficulties that continue to confront the country.Has the country shifted from being a constitutional state to a rogue state? No, the country continues to be a multiparty democracy. It regularly hold its elections to elect leaders. Only last year the country went to the polls for the local government elections and there were significant changes in which the ANC lost some metros to the opposition parties.What does this suggest? It suggests that the country is on the correct political trajectory, fully committed to the rule of law and the Constitution.Radical transformation should not mean that the political wheels are coming off, rather that the country commits itself to social and economic justice for all.The political instability within the ANC is something keeping millions of South Africans awake at night. As the governing party, the majority of the people continue to expect guidance and leadership from the ANC.By definition, the ANC has projected itself as the leader of society, and perhaps even as a pathfinder, expected to lead the people of this country to a promised land plenty , to use a biblical metaphor.But the abrasive and war-talk language used by some members of the ANC Youth League at a rally just a few days ago should never be countenanced, and should have no place in a democracy. It is not kosher, not even revolutionary, to threaten others with violence, even as you hold different political views. All South Africans are entitled to follow political programmes of their choice, and this is provided for in the country s Constitution.To suggest that, as some of the ANC Youth League seem to think, that it is right to use petrol bombs against the opposition in the name of defending the President is not only ugly, it is also a misplaced anachronism that should not be countenanced by a nation that has committed itself to embracing constitutional democracy.With all the challenges facing the country, the ratings agencies are duty bound to properly discern the country s political and economic contexts and not act in ways that will lead to economic misery for all South Africans.-Jo-Mangaliso Mdhlela
