With the start of the 2017 academic year fast approaching, universities across the country have the mammoth task of registering prospective students competing to get placed.Hundreds of thousands of them have applied for limited spaces available at various institutions of higher learning.The University of South Africa alone received 287764 to study across its nationwide campuses of which 210082 have thus far been captured, while the Tshwane University of Technology has received 95000 applications of which 60505 will be registered to study in 2017.TUT spokesperson Willa de Ruyter said: The university will be able to accommodate 15000 first-year students in 2017. At the height of the 2016 #FeesMustFall protests, which at one stage threatened to hinder the writing of exams, it was feared that thousands of prospective first-year students around the country would not have any space due to a bottleneck in the system.Wits University spokesperson Buhle Zuma said: The university has met its target of registering 6200 first-time-first-year students. TUT will accommodate among the highest number of first-time students at 15000, while Wits was among the most popular choice among students receiving more than 70000 applications of which approximately 32000 have been registered thus far.The University of Cape Town (UCT) clocked in 26146 applications to study this year, with registration scheduled to take place later in the month from February 27 to March 10.The University of the Western Cape received 30 000 applications and will be welcoming approximately 4285 new students at orientation.Across the country, universities have continued to embrace technology with online applications proving a popular channel for students to access their preferred institutions.UCT spokesperson Thami Nkwanyane said: About 90% of the applications received were online. TUT spokesperson Willa de Ruyter said: For students it is a cost-effective system, since they can use it from the convenience of their homes or a nearby internet caf , which saves time, so students don t have to stand in long queues and they can save on travel costs. Wits University for its part received more than 58000 online applications and just more than 12000 manual ones.Siphiwe Mchunusiphiwem@thenewage.co.za
