The Grahamstown High Court has dismissed with cost the application to have the Eastern Cape Provincial Elective Conference nullified. The order‚ given by a full bench was read out in the high court on Tuesday. The judgment comes four days before the party holds its elective conference. Some branches of the ANC at the OR Tambo region, Joe Gqabi and Amathole regions had sought the order to nullify the conference where Oscar Mabuyane was elected as a Chairperson. The ruling comes as a victory for Mabuyane. The regions contested that the conference could not be legitimately convened. They argued that even if the conference was legitimately convened, it would be unlawful for the conference to be allowed to continue after violence broke out. Several delegates who allegedly supported Premier Phumulo Masualle walked out the conference fearing for more violence. -TNA Reporter
