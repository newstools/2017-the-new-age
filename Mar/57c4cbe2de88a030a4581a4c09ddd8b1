The Department of Land Affairs has roped in the army to train future black farmers.This is to create a pool of agricultural skills that will help beneficiaries of land restitution become successful farmers and agriculturists.The first batch of pupils from KwaZulu-Natal have been dispatched to the Thaba Nchu army base where they will learn leadership skills, self-discipline and patriotism for three months.The National Rural Youth Service Corp aims to train 450 young people from KZN s rural districts.The department s director for youth development Kemraj Ramballi said this was part of building a skills base for their 10-year agri-parks programmes that will feed their regional agri-hubs.From there, emerging farmers, mainly those who get land back under the land restitution programme, will have access to these skilled pupils. This will also help in rural development and uplifting of agriculture in rural areas of the province where farming is the main economic activity. The idea is to have enough skilled youth in agricultural matters, he said.The youth will be with the army for three months.After their training, they will go back to various technical and vocational education and training colleges to enrol in agriculture, construction and related courses. These are the same pupils we are going to look at when we want skills for our agri-parks that we are establishing all over the province. They can start their own farming projects and use the skills they are going to acquire, Ramballi said.Nonhlanhla Gumede, 22, from Madlankala near Richards Bay said this training was the right step towards professional development as pupils. This will help me polish my skills in agriculture. I want to use my skills to develop my community and help provide enough food, Gumede said.SIHLE MAVUSOsihlem@thenewage.co.za
