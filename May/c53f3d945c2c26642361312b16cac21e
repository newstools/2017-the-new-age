Thousands of girls die every year from largely preventable causes, a report by the World Health Organisation and partners indicates.According to the WHO report Global Accelerated Action for the Health of Adolescents (AA-HA!): Guidance to support country implementation, low and middle-income countries in Africa and southeast Asia are the hardest hit with more than two thirds of these occurring in these regions in 2015.The report states that young boys die mostly from road accident injuries while adolescent girls die from lower respiratory tract infections, pregnancy complications and complications from unsafe abortions, among others.More than 3000 adolescents girls die every day, a total of 1.2 million deaths a year through road traffic injuries, lower respiratory tract infections and suicide, most of which can be prevented through good health services, education and social support.However, these girls do not have access to critical prevention and care services because these services are either non-existent or because they are not aware of them.WHO assistant director-general Dr Flavia Bustreo said: Adolescents have been entirely absent from national health plans for decades. Relatively small investments focused on adolescents now will not only result in healthy and empowered adults who thrive and contribute positively to their communities, but it will also result in healthier future generations, yielding enormous returns, Bustreo said.Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), secretary-general Anele Yawa said health facilities in South Africa were not friendly to young people. When it comes to young people, our clinics are not friendly to them at all. Young people don t feel comfortable talking about health issues with healthcare workers because they feel judged, he said.Yawa called for sexual education at schools, saying this would play an important role in reducing preventable deaths. How do we begin talking about ending HIV-Aids in the next decade when thousands of our young girls are being infected weekly? Young girls being infected is another crisis. We also need to look at the socio-economic issues that affect our young girls, Yawa said.According to the WHO more than 2 million adolescents are living with HIV-Aids.The health body says although the overall number of HIV-related deaths had declined by 30% since the 2006 estimates suggesting that HIV deaths among adolescents were rising. This increase, which has been predominantly in the WHO Africa region, may reflect the fact that although more children with HIV survive into adolescence, they do not all then get the care and support they need to.LERATO DIALE AND ZODIDI MHLANA
