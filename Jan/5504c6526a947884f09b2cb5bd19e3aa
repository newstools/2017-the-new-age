Scores of former mineworkers continue to flock to Kaizer Sebothelo Stadium in Botshabelo near Bloemfontein to apply for their unemployment benefits.This is after the decision by the labour department and other government agencies to pay UIF benefits to former mineworkers or their dependents monies that were not claimed.Provincial labour department spokesperson Josial Ramokoena said by yesterday, no less than 500 applications had been received from eligible claimants since Tuesday.He said this campaign was still taking place in Botshabelo and it will end tomorrow. It is of critical importance to note the fact that this special project is only earmarked for ex-mineworkers who left their employment in 1987. Ramokoena said following the People s Assembly held in Bhizana, Eastern Cape where a motion was tabled in the National Assembly on September 19, 2007, that Parliament was to establish a committee that would look at issues of the ex-mineworkers union, an ad-hoc committee was established. It was established to investigate matters raised in submissions from the ex-mineworkers union, to consider records, reports and submissions by stakeholders previously involved.To recommend points to assist in addressing their concerns relating to payment of compensation and outstanding unemployment benefits, Ramokoena said.He said that the end product of this investigation and deliberations by all parties was a resolve that a special nation-wide project aimed at paying what is due to these ex-mineworkers had to be embarked upon. This project started in earnest in the Free State and will be rolled out to other towns in the province later on. We therefore call upon the ex-mineworkers to come in their numbers to apply for these benefits.It is required of an individual claimant to bring along all relevant documents for officials to verify the authenticity of the claim and ascertain whether or not you indeed worked in the mines during the said period, Ramokoena said.He said claimants had to bring reference books (old identity documents), employee cards, payslip and blue cards. Be that as it may, beneficiaries are encouraged to bring along all the necessary documentation at their disposal to help fast-track the process. In addition, such documentation can also assist in proper calculation of credits an individual beneficiary qualifies for, failing which a flat rate of R3000 will be paid to the claimant, Ramokoena said.He said that that could be done with the understanding that the applicant submitted proof that he or she worked in the mining sector. If the salary information can be obtained as well as full periods of service, the benefit payment will be based on such available information, Ramokoena said.beckers@thenewage.co.za
