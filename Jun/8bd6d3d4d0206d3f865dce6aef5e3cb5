Nearly a year after coming to power in a contested election, Zambian President Edgar Lungu is facing a growing chorus of criticism over his government&#8217;s moves to clamp down on dissent.&#8220;Zambia eminently qualifies to be branded a dictatorship,&#8221; the country&#8217;s religious leaders said in a rare statement on Friday, the latest sign that opposition to Lungu&#8217;s authority is spreading.At the heart of the tensions is the arrest and continued detention of opposition leader Hakainde Hichilema, a wealthy businessman who has run for president five times, and narrowly lost out to Lungu last August.His United Party for National Development (UPND) unsuccessfully tried to contest what it called a stolen election, and in April Hichilema was arrested on treason charges after his convoy allegedly refused to give way to the presidential motorcade.He has since been moved to a maximum security prison and it is unclear when he will return to court.In the meantime, the authorities have kept up pressure on his supporters, including blocking a prominent South African opposition leader from attending Hichilema&#8217;s trial last month.&#8220;Hakainde&#8217;s arrest for treason was at first dismissed as an intimidatory gimmick by president Lungu,&#8221; said Telesphore Mpundu, the archbishop of the Lusaka diocese, but &#8220;outrage over Hichilema&#8217;s arrest and incarceration is growing.&#8221;Treason is a non-bailable offence in Zambia, with a minimum jail term of 15 years and a maximum sentence of death.And Lungu himself did not mince his words during last year&#8217;s campaign, warning political rivals and activists that &#8220;if they push me against the wall, I will sacrifice democracy for peace.&#8221; &#8216;What crisis?&#8217; Last week, parliament suspended 48 UPND lawmakers who boycotted Lungu&#8217;s address to legislators in March, depriving them of pay while demanding they recognise Lungu&#8217;s legitimacy.The government has also increased pressure on media outlets that support the opposition, further eroding Zambia&#8217;s longstanding reputation as a stable democracy.Tensions are mounting even as the government battles slowing economic growth after prices plunged for copper, the country&#8217;s key export, leading to soaring inflation and unemployment.&#8220;We have to see the violent arrest and subsequent detention of Hichilema, and the suspension of the 48 opposition lawmakers, in a much wider context,&#8221; said Sishuwa Sishuwa, a politics lecturer at the University of Zambia.&#8220;One that has seen the critical free press stifled and eventually shut, a number of nonstate actors such as trade unions and religious organisations co-opted or muted, and free speech effectively suppressed,&#8221; he said.The government has dismissed the claims.&#8221;What crisis? There is no crisis,&#8221; Lungu told journalists Friday after the church leaders&#8217; statement.Earlier in the week, government spokeswoman Mulenga Kampamba told AFP: &#8220;Who tells you the country is sliding into a dictatorship? We are a democratic country where state institutions are operating without any interference.&#8221;But such claims have failed to sway many outside observers, with Amnesty International&#8217;s Southern Africa director Deprose Muchena warning in April that Hichilema and his aides were &#8220;victims of longstanding persecution&#8221; by the authorities, facing charges that are designed to &#8220;harass and intimidate&#8221;.For Lungu&#8217;s critics, his intentions of silencing Hichilema have been made brutally clear.Earlier this year, a senior official in Lungu&#8217;s Patriotic Front party hinted that the government was losing its patience.&#8220;He should take note that we will treat him the way a rat is treated if you want to catch it, for those of us who eat mbeba (rats) we know how to catch a rat,&#8221; said deputy secretary general Mumbi Phiri.&#8220;It is time that we confined him to the dustbins of political history.&#8221;Days later Hichilema was arrested.-AFP
