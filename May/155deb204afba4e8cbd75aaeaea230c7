The ANC in the Western Cape has accused the DA of stalling Helen Zille s disciplinary hearing in the hope that the public will forget about her procolonialism views.Acting ANC chairperson Khaya Magaxa made the accusation yesterday as he noted that while more than a month had passed since Zille was formally charged for her tweets, a date still had to be set for her disciplinary hearing.Western Cape Premier Zille, also a former leader of the DA, caused outrage with a series of tweets she issued in March. As criticism heaped on her, the DA, including Zille s successor as national leader, Mmusi Maimane, put a distance between itself and Zille.In April, the DA formally charged her with bringing the party into disrepute and damages. But Zille has apologized for her tweets. Zille has since engaged an advocate and a lawyer to defend her. But she has not appeared yet.Yesterday advocate Glynnis Breytenbach, chairperson of the DA s federal legal commission, said that no date had been set for Zille s formal hearing. Magaxa said the delay in her hearing was deliberate. They think that if they delay, the attention on Zille will water down. This is a serious issue and it will haunt the DA until the next election. No reasonable democrat will allow it to go away. In one of her tweets Zille messaged: For those claiming legacy of colonialism was only negative, think of our independent judiciary, transport infrastructure, piped water etc. DENNIS CRUYWAGENdennisc@thenewage.co.za
