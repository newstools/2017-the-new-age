The Ahmed Kathrada Foundation has on Wednesday called on society to be part of the march calling on President Jacob Zuma to step down.The march organised by the Democratic Alliance (DA) is expected to start at Church Square in Pretoria at 12pm on Friday and will proceed to the Union Buildings.The Foundation s Director Neeshan Balton said Friday s march forms part of a range of initiatives planned by various organisations over the last week asking the President to step down. The Foundation is supportive of any initiative of this nature, provided that these are legal, peaceful and that its leadership is visible. We are pleased that a year after anti-apartheid struggle stalwart, Ahmed Kathrada s letter to President Zuma, urging him to step down, various other organisations have shared similar sentiments calling for the President to be held to account.&#8221;Balton added that the Foundation would this weekend be convening a consultative meeting that seeks to bring together all organisations who have expressed a sentiment similar to that of Kathrada s, calling on President Jacob Zuma to resign.The march is among a series of marches and pickets against the President&#8217;s cabinet reshuffle.WATCH: SaveSA marches to Treasury On Friday, 07 April, our Leader, @MmusiMaimane will lead a #MarchForChange through the streets of the Johannesburg city centre! pic.twitter.com/H55oTF5Bcu Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) April 5, 2017 #FreedomFriday If you care about the future of become an active citizen &amp; lets get out in our thousands.

We think, after all his undeniable contribution to both the movement and the country, the time has come for him to step down and allow the country to be led forward by a new collective at a government level, said COSATU General Secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali.Cosatu also stated that it will never march with the DA unless they are marching to the Western Cape to call for Helen Zille to resign.&#8220;We will never march with the DA and its friends. The only march we will join led by the DA will be if they are going to Cape Town to call for Helen Zille to resign,&#8221; said Ntshalintshali.-TNA Reporter &nbsp;
