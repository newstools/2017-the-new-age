More than half of malaria cases in South Africa were imported cases, the National Institute for Communicable (NICD) diseases, said.Of the 9478 malaria cases reported in the 2016-17 malaria season, 5177 were imported cases.This is an increase in the number of malaria cases recorded in the country when compared to the previous season.The institute said there had been an increase in the number of malaria cases in the past few weeks, saying this was likely due to people travelling over the Easter holiday. Noting that the incubation period for malaria is 10-14 days, travellers from both low and high malaria risk areas presenting with fever and flu-like symptoms must go to a healthcare facility or see their doctor for a malaria test even if chemo-prophylaxis was taken, the institute said.The increase has been attributed to the rise in ambient temperature, rainfall and humidity.Limpopo was hardest hit recording 1648 malaria cases and three deaths.According to the institute, a total number of 76 people died in the 2016-17 season when compared to 58 deaths last year and 130 deaths in the 2014-15 period.The NICD attributed the lower number of malaria cases recorded in the 2015-16 period to the crippling drought experienced in the country during that season.The institute has advised any person who presents with flu-like symptoms and has travelled to a malaria risk areas to seek medical help.This is because they are unlikely to have influenza as the influenza season has not yet started.The increase in malaria cases can be seen as a blow to South Africa s efforts to eliminate malaria by 2018, a target many believe is unlikely.Wits University researchers believe the discovery of another mosquito vector, Anopheles vaneedeni, poses a challenge to South Africa s target of eliminating malaria by 2018.Maureen Coetzee, director of the Wits Research Institute for malaria in the faculty of health sciences and her colleagues, stated in an article in The Conversation, the discovery of this mosquito vector poses a challenge for malaria control in the country as there are no methods that control mosquitoes that operate outdoors .This as conventional malaria measures such as indoor spraying and insecticide treated bed nets only target mosquitoes that operate indoors. 701478-TNA REPORTER
