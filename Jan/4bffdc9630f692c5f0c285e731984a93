Struggle stalwarts of the African National Congress(ANC) will meet on Tuesday to discuss the January 8 statement delivered by the party&#8217;s President Jacob Zuma and preparation for a consultative conference.The meeting by the group of stalwarts follows the statement which marked the organisation&#8217;s 105th Birthday.Zuma drew lessons in closing ranks from the annals of ANC history amid deepening divisions in the liberation movement.Addressing thousands of undaunted ANC party faithful who braved the wet and chilly weather at the party s anniversary celebration at Orlando stadium in Soweto, Zuma urged the ANC rank and file to learn from the party s national consultative conferences which came at a time when the ANC was confronted by serious challenges pressed upon it by the apartheid regime.He said that the overarching theme for the ANC s 1969 consultative conference in Morogoro, Tanzania and the subsequent 1985 Kabwe conference in Zambia was unity. The period prior to the 1969 Morogoro conference was a period of unhappiness for our movement. The leadership headed by president Oliver Tambo discussed issues frankly and in a comradely manner. The Kabwe conference also emphasised the importance of utmost unity in order to defeat the regime and liberate the people, Zuma said.Zuma s comments come against the background of the stalwarts and veterans who signed the For the Sake of our Future document gearing up for a meeting with the ANC s policy unit this week on their call for a national consultative conference before the ANC s policy conference later this year.The veterans argued that the conference would help the ANC tackle divisions and factionalism which have dogged the party s efforts in fostering unity within the movement.They were unhappy that the conference would take place, two days before the policy conference of the ANC calling for distance between the events.The stalwarts hoped that the gap would help in the process of winning back the confidence of the people and also proposed that civil society organisations be allowed in the talks.-TNA Reporter
