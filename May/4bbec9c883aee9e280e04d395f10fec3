More victims have come forward with allegations against controversial pastor Tim Omotoso who is facing charges of human trafficking, the Hawks said.Investigations by the elite police unit into sex and human trafficking allegations levelled at Omotoso, a pastor at the Jesus Dominion International, have been ongoing since his first court appearance on April 21 in Port Elizabeth. Hawks spokesperson Lt-Col Robert Netshiunda said: We ve been speaking to more alleged victims and we are still visiting more provinces as we continue with our investigations. Some of the women allegedly abused by him come from KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and Mpumalanga.He has remained behind bars since his arrest. He will be applying for bail when he appears in court today, Netshiunda said. The 58-year-old pastor from Nigeria has been in the news since allegations of human trafficking and sexual exploitation levelled against him by numerous young women who used to worship at his church emerged. It is believed that up to 30 young women have come forward claiming that Omotoso took them to his Umhlanga Rocks rented house where the alleged abuse happened.He faces human trafficking charges and other charges are likely to be added as the investigation continues. Despite the serious allegations, the church leadership and congregants have come out in defence of the embattled pastor. Omotoso is also being defended by a gospel musical group which he established, called Simply Chrysolite. Simply Chrysolite s leader, Thab zo Mkhwanazi, said they had never experienced any abuse at the hands of the pastor.She also dismissed reports that some group members were forced to drop out of university after joining the group. Omotoso s church has branches in several provinces across South Africa, Britain and other countries in Africa. Members of his church are expected to be in court today.-ZODIDI MHLANA|zodidim@thenewage.co.za
