The 54-member state African Union (AU) will today elect a new commission chairperson to replace its outgoing leader Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, who is not seeking a second term of office.Heads of states and dignitaries arrived in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, which is the headquarters of the continental body, to attend the summit.Five candidates are looking to replace Dlamini Zuma, the first woman to lead the AU commission.Dlamini Zuma is widely believed to be in the running for the presidency of the African National Union, to replace her former husband, President Jacob Zuma, in a tightly contested race.President Jacob Zuma, is South Africa s fourth democratically-elected president since the end of apartheid in 1994.Despite criticisms during her fouryear tenure, Dlamini Zuma is hailed for breaking the glass ceiling as the first woman to win office in the AU, an act that many feel she is capable of repeating in South Africa to become the first woman president. The country has already had a woman deputy president, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, who served under former president Thabo Mbeki from 2005 to 2008.Some of Dlamini Zuma s achievements include: Spearheading the launch of Agenda 2063 a long-term vision of where Africa wants to be in another 50 years in which she managed to get political buy-in from member states.She made women s rights the theme of two consecutive AU summits.As a result the AU started a major campaign to end child marriage, which is taking root in many African countries.Her presence in the AU has given more prominence to African issues, particularly as they pertain to South Africa.The five candidates seeking election to the position of AU commission chairperson are: Amina Mohamed, Kenya s foreign minister Widely seen as a front-runner for the job, Amina has the backing of almost all Anglophone countries. Abdoulaye Bathily, Senegalese diplomat and academic seen by many analysts as a strong candidate for the AU chair seat. He has strong support from Morocco, which could complicate his bid.Morocco, the only country in the continent that is not part of the AU, withdrew from the union in 1984 to protest against the admission of disputed Western Sahara territories. Moussa Faki Mahamat, Chadian foreign minister Mahamat is another candidate showing a strong possibility of snatching the seat from the favourites, Amina and Bathily Pelonomi Venson-Moitoi, a veteran politician from Botswana Mba Mokuy, Served as a senior adviser to Equatorial Guinea s President. Mokuy s chance of becoming the chairperson is believed to be even slimmer than Venson-Moitoi s. with al-Jazeera. 701295-TNA REPORTER
