Oakbay Resources has challenged the Business Day to provide proof that its accounts have been closed by Bank of Baroda as alleged by the publication.Oakbay expressed deep &#8220;frustration&#8221; following yet another article published by the Business Day on Thursday alleging the impending closure of Oakbay accounts by the bank, allegations which have repeatedly been denied.&#8220;It is very clear that you are trying to construct a false narrative linking Oakbay/Bank of Baroda accounts to developments with the executive branch. This is outrageous,&#8221; said Oakbay.Earlier this month the Business Day reported that the bank was considering closing Oakbay accounts at the end of March allegations which have no proof.However Oakbay has repeatedly stated it was business as usual with the bank.Oakbay on Thursday reiterated that &#8220;there is NO DEADLINE from the Bank of Baroda.&#8221;The company has called on Business Day to either provide proof of their latest claims or retract their story.&#8220;Should you not correct your article, we will seek to recover damages through our lawyers,&#8221; said Oakbay.A sustained campaign has been in place to place Bank of Baroda under pressure to server ties with Oakbay since First National Bank, Absa, Standard Bank and Nedbank closed the groups accounts.-TNA Reporter
