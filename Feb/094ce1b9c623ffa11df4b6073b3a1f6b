Head of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) Robert Mcbride has on Wednesday told Parliament that arrests against investigator Paul O&#8217;Sullivan&#8217;s are an attempt to distract from investigations against National Police Commissioner Kgomotso Phahlane.&#8220;The issue here is Phahlane&#8217;s corrupt relationship, it is not who assists us with our investigations lets be clear on that. No amount of obstruction will change the facts we have before us,&#8221; said Mcbride.Mcbride made the comments while appearing before Parliament&#8217;s police portfolio committee.O Sullivan was arrested on Monday afternoon on a string of charges including, impersonating a police officer and intimidation.The charges were related to O Sullivan s role in the investigation into Phahlane s R80000 sound system and expensive house in Pretoria.According to Mcbride, IPID had appointed one of its most senior investigators to probe the Phahlane case and O&#8217;Sullivan was not hired for that purpose.&#8220;We have recordings of every interview. At no stage did any of the two civilians who were assisting with the investigation present themselves as IPID investigators or as police officers.&#8220;The person leading the investigation Mr Mandla Mahlangu is a very experienced IPID investigator and his investigations have resulted in long sentences for criminal and corrupt police officer. I have the utmost respect and integrity for him and his ability,&#8221; said McBride.McBride further added that claims made by Phahlane of not being aware of an investigation against him are false.&#8220;General Phahlane denied here in Parliament and to the public that he was unaware of a investigation, this is blatantly false.&#8221;&#8220;We have documentary proof that not only was he informed about it, we have his signature on document instructing his P.A to arrange a meeting and that&#8217;s as early as June 2016,&#8221; said McBride.TNA Reporter
