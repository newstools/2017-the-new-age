Athletics SA (ASA) appears to have courted controversy with an inconsistent selection criteria for the upcoming World Championships.And that s apart from the fact that the squad is dominated by men, who make up to 70% of the team headed for London, with a fewer number of women picked for the IAAF event. No sooner had the athletics body announced the 24-man squad on Saturday than Wayne Snyman, a race walker, tweeted he had appealed the decision to omit him. Snyman represented the country at the Rio Olympics although the 32 year old could not earn a medal after he finished in 58th place.Like some, Snyman has met the IAAF s B-qualifying standard, yet could not achieve the strict A-standard criteria set by the local athletics body. Among others who have also missed out include inform distance runner Dominique Scott-Efurd, sprinters Justine Palframan, 400m hurdlers Cornel Fredericks and LJ van Zyl, Anel Oosthuizen and 100m runner and Olympian Henricho Bruintjies. The final team includes all four track and field medallists from the 2016 Rio Olympic Games, headlined by Wayde van Niekerk and Caster Semenya.Van Niekerk girded his loins for the world championship with another splendid performance as he powered down the final straight to win in the time of 43.73 seconds at the Diamond League in Monaco at the weekend. Semenya recorded her season s best as she won the 800m in the time of 1:55.27 while Akani Simbine could not run a sub-10 as he finished third behind Usain Bolt and second-placed Isaiah Young in the 100m dash.SA president Aleck Skhosana said the aim is to improve on the 2015 edition in Beijing where the team bagged three medals one gold and two bronze. We believe this is one of the strongest teams ever selected for the world championships and we are confident they will return home with a bag full of medals, Skhosana said. -KGOMOTSO SETHUSHA|kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
