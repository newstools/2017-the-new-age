The ANC has condemned the decision by Eskom&#8217;s board of directors to reinstate Brian Molefe as its Chief Executive calling it &#8220;reckless.&#8221;&#8221; Mr. Molefe left Eskom under a cloud following the release of the Public Protector&#8217;s report into State Capture late last year. The report, while still under review, made observations against Mr. Molefe which, at the time, he had deemed serious and significant enough to warrant his resignation.&#8221; The decision, therefore, to reinstate him in his former position without these matters being resolved is tone deaf to the South African public&#8217;s absolute exasperation and anger at what seems to be government&#8217;s lackluster and lackadaisical approach to dealing decisively with corruption &#8211; perceived or real,&#8221; said ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa.Molefe is set to return to his former job at the power utility on Monday. The news was confirmed by Eskom board spokesperson Khulani Qoma on Friday. According to Qoma, the decision was made in the last few days following consultation with various legal experts following controversy around Molefe being set to receive a R30-million pension payout from the power utility.Trade Federation Cosatu has also voiced out against Molefe&#8217;s return to Eskom saying they were &#8220;shocked by the shear arrogance of the board.&#8221;&#8220;This man who was crying &#8230; and saying he needed time to clear himself, now without saying anything to clear himself is taken back. The arrogance of it all is shocking to us. They are poking the people of South Africa in the eye,&#8221; said Cosatu spokesperson Sizwe Pamla.According to Pamla Cosatu will on Monday convene a meeting of its national office bearers where the matter will be discussed thoroughly.However, the Progressive Professionals Forum has welcomed Molefe&#8217;s return.&#8221; We have always thought that Brian should not have left Eskom, because he is an asset not only to Eskom but to this country,&#8221; the group said in a statement.&#8220;We as PPF support his return and we are excited at the news because we dont believe you can have all these people acting in these state owned entities&#8230;we welcome Brian and he has 100% of our support.&#8221;Molefe announced his resignation as CEO of the power utility in January. In a statement released, Molefe attacked former public protector Thuli Madonsela s State of Capture, which had labelled him as being corrupt because of his close ties with the Gupta family.-TNA Reporter
