Mpumalanga Premier David Mabuza has on Wednesday labelled recent comments made by Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema regarding his political career as &#8220;pointless&#8221; and &#8221; an agenda to cause confusion.&#8221;Mabuza in a statement has distanced himself from comments made by the EFF leader on Tuesday at the party headquarters where he said among others that National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete and Mabuza had formed a pact to challenge for the top two positions in the ANC. He is not my spokesperson, let us not pay attention on him, he is trying to confuse us. We have to focus on the business at hand. Our administration runs until 2019, we have clear deliverables as per our popular mandate that we must work on, said Mabuza.Mabuza responded to Malema during the opening of the three-day Provincial executive council lekgotla in Mbombela.Speaking during the opening of the Lekgotla, Mabuza urged his executive to not be distracted by the perception that in performing their duties, they were campaigning for the ruling party.&#8220;We should not hide under the political turmoil that is currently taking place in the country.As we continue to do our work, people will say we are campaigning for the ANC elective conference scheduled for later this year,&#8221; said Mabuza.Speaking on Tuesday Malema made a series of claims against Mabuza including that the Mpumalanga Premier enjoyed significant financial backing from anonymous backers which he would use to secure votes during the ANC&#8217;s elective conference.&#8220;DD [Mabuza] is confident. There&#8217;s a big chance his team might win because they have money and DD is already seeing himself as President,&#8221; said Malema.&#8220;If DD works hard and brings a solid foundation, Baleka will be president and DD the Deputy President because Mpumalanga as a province is united,&#8221; Malema continued.Meanwhile the provincial Lekgotla is scheduled to end on Friday ahead of Mabuza delivering the state of the province address next week.-TNA Reporter
