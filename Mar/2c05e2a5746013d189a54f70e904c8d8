Spanish police were on Friday hunting more than a hundred restaurant customers who fled without paying the bill.The party enjoyed a 2,000-euro ($2,100) banquet on Monday at the Hotel Carmen restaurant in Bembibre, northern Spain, before promptly doing a runner.&#8220;They were dancing, then suddenly they had disappeared. In one minute, a hundred people had left,&#8221; restaurant boss Antonio Rodriguez told Cadena Ser radio.&#8220;They didn&#8217;t leave in little groups &#8212; no, they went all at once.&#8221;Restaurant staff were unable to stop them, Rodriguez said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t do anything when there&#8217;s so many of them.&#8221;The Guardia Civil police declined to confirm media reports that the fleeing diners were from Eastern Europe, but an official from the force said they were not Spanish nationals.&#8220;We know roughly where they are,&#8221; he added.-AFP
