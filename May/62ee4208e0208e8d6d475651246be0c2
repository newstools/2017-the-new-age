The ANC in the Free State has accused SACP deputy Secretary Jeremy Cronin of intentionally creating division in the ANC.While addressing the Western Cape SACP Jeremy Cronin told members that Free State premier Ace Magashule was the one who arranged the buses of people to come to May Day rally with 100% Zuma t-shirts.However, the party s spokesperson in the province, Thabo Meeko, dismissed Cronin s claims saying that he was in fact undermining the ANC s efforts of uniting the alliance in the Province.Meeko said it was unfortunate of Cronin for making a reckless statement regarding ANC&#8217;s provincial chair Ace Magashule without any evidence. Magashule convened a meeting with the officials of the Alliance immediately after the incidents to try and understand the unfortunate disruption of workers day. He is on record for having expressed his concern about the fact that workers could not be addressed by leadership, he said.On the allegations that Magashule bussed in supporters to May Day Rally, Meeko said it has always been a tradition that the ANC will assist Cosatu of mobilising people to make sure the rally becomes a success.However, Cronin also said May Day disruptions were not against the ANC, but it was against those who were seen as &#8220;looters&#8221; in the organisation. Where there were May Day disruptions it wasn&#8217;t against the ANC. It was against a looting faction of the ANC, the SACP deputy secretary said.He then made reference to Northern Cape reshuffle by Premier Lucas and the reinstatement of Brian Molefe as Eskom CEO, as signs of the deep rot in the country.-Sipho Jack
