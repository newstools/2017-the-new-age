Sony chief executive Kazuo Hirai on Tuesday hailed a years-long company restructuring as a success, but said struggles in its movie business remain a &#8220;pressing issue&#8221;.The 56-year-old company veteran was tapped five years ago to lead a major overhaul at the once-iconic company, which was suffering from huge losses largely tied to a hard-hit consumer electronics business.After years of layoffs and asset sales, Sony is on track to report a 500 billion yen operating profit this fiscal year ,its highest in two decades.&#8221;We&#8217;ve done significant work on downsizing or restructuring the business,&#8221; Hirai told reporters at a corporate strategy briefing.&#8220;The major downsizing is complete.&#8221;The biggest factor is that our consumer electronics business, which struggled for many years, has turned into a division with stable profitability,&#8221; he added.Sony&#8217;s bleeding television business , which Hirai had refused to sell despite calls to dump the unit , is now back to profitability as the firm focuses on producing fewer models with an eye on the higher-end market.South Korean and Taiwanese rivals have battered higher-cost Japanese TV makers, including Sony and Sharp.&#8220;(We) changed our strategy to go after profitability rather than focus on the size of the business,&#8221; Hirai said, referring to the TV unit.&#8221;Now the challenge is to stay in the black.&#8221;In recent years, Sony has sold off a string of assets, including the Vaio laptop business and a unit that made rechargeable lithium ion batteries.Smartphone components and the top-selling PlayStation 4 games console have boosted its bottom line.But the company took a nearly $1 billion write-down at its movie unit as Sony Pictures&#8217; woes included box-office disappointments such as a reboot of the Eighties classic &#8220;Ghostbusters&#8221; with an all-female cast and &#8220;Inferno&#8221;, a sequel to the &#8220;Da Vinci Code&#8221;.The movie business is &#8220;a pressing issue for Sony&#8221;, Hirai told reporters.-AFP
