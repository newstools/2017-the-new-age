Joburg residents should brace themselves for a potential 12.2% increase in the tariff for water and sanitation.The City of Johannesburg council on Thursday announced the proposed tariffs for the 2017/18 financial year for public consultation.Executive Mayor Herman Mashaba also announced that only poor households would receive free basic water.&#8220;It is the trend across our country s metros to no longer provide free basic water to all residents, but only to registered indigent residents which is in line with the National Water Policy and recommendation from National Treasury.&#8220;Given the scarcity of water in Johannesburg, the huge inequality in our city, and the massive infrastructure and service delivery backlog we believe it is in the best interests of our residents to follow this national trend,&#8221; said Mashaba in a statement.Mashaba added that indigent households would receive between 10kl and 15kl per month, depending on their score on the prevailing COJ Poverty Index.Domestic users who do not qualify as indigents can now expect a increase of R42.84 per month to their water bill.Meanwhile the City announced further increases including a 2.28% increase in the electricity tariff, while the refuse removal tariff will go up by 6.1%. Property rates will go up by 6.2%.&#8220;During this process we have had to carefully balance the cost implications of service delivery incurred by the City with the affordability of services, promotion of access to services for all our residents, and cross-subsidisation of the poor; while at the same time maintaining the City s competitiveness when comparing our tariffs to other metros,&#8221; said Mashaba.The new tariffs follow an announcement by the South African Reserve Bank that the reporate has been left unchanged at 7%.&#8220;Inflation outlook has improved due to further appreciation of the rand exchange rate,&#8221; said Reserve bank governor Lesetja Kganyago.Kganyago also announced that CPI inflation was expected to average 5.9% for the year compared with 6.2% during previous forecasts.-TNA Reporter
