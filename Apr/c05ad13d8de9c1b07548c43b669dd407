Retail group Pick n Pay has delivered a double-digit growth of 18% in headline earnings per share for the full year ended February, maintaining positive momentum over the past four years.Headline earnings a share were 264.35 cents in the period compared to the prior period s 224.04 cents. The group reflected a lower turnover growth of 7% to R77.5bn, citing a difficult consumer environment in South Africa. Throughout the year, Pick n Pay said that customers faced growing pressure on their household budgets, resulting from high food inflation, rising utility and transport costs and stagnating real incomes.The group s core South African operations delivered growth in profit before tax of 20%, reporting tough trading conditions in Zambia which constrained growth in the rest of Africa division. Zambia was greatly affected by the impact of drought and related water and power outages, coupled with the low copper price, that continued to dampen economic growth across the region.The group opened 12 new supermarkets outside South Africa during the year, three in Namibia, six in Zambia, one in Zimbabwe and two in Botswana with plans to open its first stores in Ghana and Nigeria over the next two years. Pick n Pay paid R753.5m in dividends to shareholders, 27.8% higher than last year while investing R1.9bn in improving the quality of its estate, R345.4m in its employee share incentive schemes and repaying R445.1m of long-term structured debt. The group modernised its control ownership structure in the first half of the year, with the unbundling of the Pick n Pay Holdings RF Group.Pick n Pay is also investing R500m in reducing the price of essential items in 1 300 of its stores. This includes vegetables, fruit and food. The group said that it had provided the best available products with shelf stock availability maintained at 96% over the period. The group says it is advanced enough to restore the business to a sustainable profit margin.-THELMA NGOMA|thelman@thenewage.co.za
