The South African Revenue Service (Sars) has on Friday called for chairperson of the Davis Tax Committee (DTC) Judge Dennis Davis to recuse himself for &#8220;misleading&#8221; the public regarding the integrity of the revenue collector.Comments attributed to Davis appeared in the City Press and Fin24 last week where Davis is reported to have told delegates at a conference on tax evasion and illicit financial flows, about a host of problems at SARS.According to reports, Davis told delegates that &#8220;the biggest challenge facing South Africa today is an erosion of the integrity of SARS.&#8221; He is also reported to have said that &#8220;Sars has no capability of actually dealing with multinational corporation and capital that seeks to evade tax.&#8221;Sars in a statement issued on Friday says he ought to know that challenges related to transfer pricing affects all tax authorities across the world.&#8220;Sars therefore denies that it has no capability to deal with non-compliance by multinational companies.&#8221;According to its website, the Davis Tax Committee is set up to &#8220;assess South Africa s tax policy framework and its role in supporting the objectives of inclusive growth, employment, development and fiscal sustainability.&#8221;The Committee was established in 2013 by Pravin Gordhan during his first tenure as Minister of Finance.Sars has also come out against suggestions reportedly made by Davis against the figure 103000 which is said to be the number of people falling into a recently announced top tax bracket announced by the Finance Minister during the 2017 Budget Speech.During his budget speech Minister Gordhan announced a new 45% tax bracket for individuals, which will apply to taxable income of more than R1.5m a year.Davis allegedly said he knows more people on the Johannesburg Bar earning R5 million a year than the tax table show.&#8220;Sars respects and protects taxpayer confidentiality and will uphold taxpayers rights as enshrined in the Tax Administration Act 28 of 2011 ( TAA ).If anything, Judge Davis is morally expected to have advised the Commissioner of SARS on categories of taxpayers which are non compliant, which could include members of the Johannesburg Bar of which he alleges to be non- compliant,&#8221; said Sars.Sars calling for Davis to recuse himself comes against the back drop of a tense relationship between Sars Commissioner Tom Moyane and the Finance Minister.Last month Moyane launched a scathing attack on the Minister for blaming tax collectors for a poor revenue collection performance.Moyane blamed a cult of personality for the strained relationship between himself and Gordhan and has requested President Jacob Zuma to intervene in the dispute.Moyane also said the Minister must stop treating him like a child.&#8211;TNA Reporter
