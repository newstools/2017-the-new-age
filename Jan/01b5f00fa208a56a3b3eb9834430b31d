The European Parliament elects a new president on Tuesday in a vote that promises to be stormy after a coalition aimed at keeping eurosceptics out of power broke down.The winner will replace Germany&#8217;s Martin Schulz, who during five years in office made the role far more powerful and prominent than it had ever been before.The new president will lead the EU&#8217;s only elected body, which will have the final say on a Brexit deal expected in two years time.The 751 members of the parliament will cast secret ballots in Strasbourg, France. The vote can go to a maximum of four rounds.The main candidates are both Italian: centre-right politician Antonio Tajani, and socialist Gianni Pittella. Another five candidates have little chance.&#8220;I am almost sure the winner will have a link with Italy,&#8221; joked Liberal candidate Guy Verhofstadt &#8212; a former Belgian premier who owns a vineyard in Italy.Schulz is meanwhile going back to politics in Germany.But the contest has been a bitter one as a long-standing agreement between the two political groups broke down.Tajani, a former spokesman for Italy s Silvio Berlusconi and ex-European commissioner, is the candidate of the European People s Party (EPP), the largest group in the assembly.The EPP, which counts German Chancellor Angela Merkel as a member, says there was an agreement under a &#8220;grand coalition&#8221; that it should get the position, as a socialist, Schulz, held it last time.The two groups have rotated the leadership of parliament between them for almost every year since the 1970s.But Pittella says he will not accept an EPP &#8220;monopoly&#8221; of the EU s top jobs, held by EPP members Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, and Donald Tusk, the head of the European Council.A Tajani win could therefore prompt calls for a reshuffle of the top jobs, adding unwelcome instability to an already crisis-hit union.Verhofstadt, the European Parliament s Brexit negotiator, meanwhile saw his chances dip after a failed merger last week with Italy s populist 5-Star Movement.The grand coalition has been seen as limiting the influence of Eurosceptic groups led by Britain s UKIP and France s National Front, after they made stunning gains in the last European Parliament elections in May 2014.The anti-EU movement has since gained strength, with Britons voting to leave the bloc in a shock referendum result last June, while across the Atlantic a similar wave of populism took Donald Trump to the US presidency.-AFP
