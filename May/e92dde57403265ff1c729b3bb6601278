State oil company PetroSA, a subsidiary of the Central Energy Fund (CEF) wholly owned by the state reports to the Department of Energy and denied talks making the rounds last week that the company had filed for business rescue.PetroSA said recent reports that the company was on the brink of collapse and needed a cash injection were inaccurate and unfair. Our financial report for the year to March, which is being prepared shows an adequate cash balance . Current assets and cash flow projections show that the company will have adequate cash resources for the business to carry on with its normal trading activities and meet its financial obligations for the foreseeable future, the company said.PetroSA stressed that its present position is that it is not in financial distress and that the company has correctly accounted for the abandonment liability and has set aside a partial amount in a special purpose vehicle towards meeting this obligation. It should be noted that this liability is not immediately due. The company is planning for the scheduled maintenance shutdown of the refinery towards the end of 2017. We are committed to the sustainability, turnaround and long-term growth of the company, the statement read.The company said it had been transparent about the challenges it was facing and these included the primary fact that the gas reserves from its wells had reached their end of life. In response to this challenge, we have embarked on a detailed turnaround plan, which includes the partial modification of the refinery to produce fuels from light crude. The company is already producing almost half of its planned production capacity from light crude, it said.Further, the company punted that the board has not passed nor does it intend to pass any resolution to place the company under business rescue, as the company s financial year-end as of March 31, reflects an adequate cash balance. However, some commentators have accused the CEF of being soft in supervising the cash-strapped PetroSA. The central objective of the CEF is to grow the energy sector to be the catalyst for economic growth and poverty alleviation through security of supply and access to affordable energy in Africa.Tshepo Kgadima, an independent analyst and also former chairperson of PetroSA Board, said his legal battle with PetroSA over his unlawful removal was indicative of the CEF board s failure to exercise fiduciary duty over PetroSA.-BERNARD SATHEKGE|bernards@thenewage.co.za
