A pedestrian and two bikers died in two separate road accidents in the Free State on Saturday.Netcare 911 paramedics said the first accident on the R706 (old Kimberley Road) between Bloemfontein and Dealesville about 2pm.Spokesperson Chris Botha said reports from the scene showed that a biker came round a bend when he collided head on with another biker.He said exact details of the incident would, however, form part of the police investigation. Paramedics arrived at the scene and found accident debris and the burning frames of the bikes scattered over a large area and consistent with that of a high impact collision, Botha said.Tragically, both riders died on impact and were declared dead at the scene by the paramedics.Meanwhile, a pedestrian was killed and the occupants of a vehicle travelling on the QwaQwa road between Harrismith and Bergville escaped unscathed after their car caught fire.Paramedics were called to the scene on Saturday where a pedestrian was hit by the car.Reports from the scene showed a man ran across the road and landed in front of a vehicle.Botha said paramedics arrived at the scene and found that the car had burst into flames on impact but fortunately, the occupants escaped uninjured. The pedestrian was found lying on the road and died before our arrival due to the injuries he sustained, Botha said.Police will investigate both accidents.The Free State had the third highest number of road fatalities during the festive season, with a 17% increase compared to the 2015 festive season.The province has, however, adopted a new road safety initiative where health scans are done during road blocks.The first was done in January where in a space of two days, 1600 drivers were scanned.Some were found to be suffering from hypertension while two had diabetes.The campaign is aimed at supporting the Arrive Alive initiative. Motorists were tested for various illnesses that included TB, blood pressure, high levels of sugar and other related illnesses.Free State is the first province to have health workers participating in the roadblocks to advise motorists about health issues while travelling on the road.KAMOGELO SEEKOEIkamogelos@thenewage.co.za
