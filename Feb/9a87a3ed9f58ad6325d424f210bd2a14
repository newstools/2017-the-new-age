We have also intensified our intelligence-driven operations to ensure that we confiscate these drugs and arrest the forces behind its distribution to the youth, Ntshinga said. It is also very encouraging to note the increase in the confiscations of illegal firearms circulating in our communities. We must ensure that our leaders of tomorrow have a bright future and that is why we will continue engaging our pupils on the dangers of substance abuse and the negative impact it has on their lives.
