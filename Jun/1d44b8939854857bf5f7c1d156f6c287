Telecommunications and Postal Services Deputy Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams says her department is working hard to make internet for all a possibility.She was speaking at the Vision 2030 Summit at the Birchwood Hotel in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni. We are part of the global world and reality is that in other countries, we find everybody participating in the internet space, she said.Ndabeni-Abrahams doesn t want South Africans to not only become consumers of the internet, but to effectively participate in that internet space.This will be done through priority targets to ensure there is Internet 4 All. She said infrastructure and connectivity are the first vital targets as 62% of the rural population lacks 3G coverage.She also said affordability is key: Encouraging affordable access and availability of broadband internet service and devices to ensure uptake and usage of the internet. The third important targets are skills and awareness of training and creating a country that becomes a digital astute society.Finally, local content which is aimed at the development of content that will support e-government services and boost development of new applications as well as empower SMME development.Hosted by Top Media Communications, the gathering is where stakeholders meet in order to help promote the work done by the government and the private sector in reaching the National Development Plan s goals of making South Africa a better country for all.She told The New Age that her aim is to make sure young people are exposed to the internet space.They should be protected from cyber crimes and schools along with libraries benefiting from the rollout of broadband. We are saying at a lower phase we have to make sure that they are trained and introduced to technology, thus making them innovative, she said.Exposure, she said, would be a catalyst for the young pupils, especially those in the townships and rural areas, who will be encouraged to look at the tech and internet space as a place of interest grooming them to become innovative creators for the country. So yes , everything that we are doing seeks to empower that young black child at home, that is why the rollout of broadband is targeting all the rural areas and including those that are in the cities, the deputy minister said.She said that the ICT sector can be used to encourage the country to find solutions to its own unique difficulties which are overarched by the triplechallenges of poverty, unemployment and inequality.As an example, she cited where South Africa won a competition on computer design in the US, exposing the talent the nation possesses. And that s a great story we have to build on. We have these young people who are innovative, but if we do not build on their capacity, including finance. It is a great achievement that she said has to be built on through the avenues of finance and other supportive measure.She feared that if this is not done, home-grown talent will be lost to other countries and a brain drain in this crucial sector will be the result.On issues regarding patenting, she said her department and the Department of Trade and Industry would make sure that SMEs in the tech sectors are not robbed of what belongs to them, in relation to issues around intellectual property. As we empower individuals by helping them to get their rights protected, we are also building on the competitiveness of South Africa. So when we protect our own intellectual property, it means we will be able to claim our rightful place in the world, the deputy minister said.Also present at the event was Leonard Chang, Huawei managing director of corporate industry development marketing, who spoke extensively about the importance of South Africa making sure it gets involved in ICT, especially in the digital economy.He said that changes happen differently and unlike the other changes the world has undertaken today, the world in changing day by day. Having a Vision 2030 plan is a great start, but a vision is not enough, we need an action plan with achievable targets. South Africa has to move faster to close the digital divide. Huawei believes that connectivity is not just a human right, it is an economic growth right, Chang said.Hloni Mashigonews@thenewage.co.za
