It May not be their primary goal, but the Junior Springboks would not be strictly truthful if they said their World Rugby U-20 Championship semifinal against England today is not a grudge match.This is because England, who will do battle with the Baby Boks at the M Meskhi stadium in Tbilisi, is the same side that knocked the South Africans out of the tournament at the same stage last year. While the Baby Boks will be happy to have avoided New Zealand, who have been unbeatable at this tournament, facing England will not be a walk in the park. To prepare for the battle, coach Chean Roux made a single change to his forwards, bringing on Salmaan Moerat at lock, replacing Hendre Stassen, who is nursing a knee injury.Moerat will partner the towering Ruben van Heerden in the second row, with Len Massyn continuing in the No 6 jersey in the place of the suspended Zayn Davids. Roux now has the tough task of guiding the Junior Springboks to the finals for the first time since 2012, when they lost to England. We looked at England s strengths and we think these are the best combinations for us for the semifinal. England are a physical side and they are full of confidence. They are the defending champions as well. But that said, our plans are in place as a team and we just need to go out there and execute them, Roux said.Roux made two changes among the replacements, with prop LeeMarvin Mazibuko replacing Wikus Groenewald, who has the flu, while Reinhard Nothnagel will provide backup for Moerat and Van Heerden. A lot of expectations will be on the shoulders of pivot Curwin Bosch, Yaw Penxe, who has been impressive at the tournament and eighth-man Juarno Augustus, who provides steel whenever the Boks need a warrior.The Junior Springboks team to face England: Manie Libbok, Yaw Penxe, Wandisile Simelane, Damian Willemse, Gianni Lombard, Curwin Bosch, Embrose Papier, Juarno Augustus, Ernst van Rhyn (captain), Len Massyn, Ruben van Heerden, Salmaan Moerat, Carl Sadie, Johan Grobbelaar, Kwenzo Blose. Replacements: Gerhard Steenekamp, Daniel Jooste, Lee-Marvin Mazibuko, Reinhard Nothnagel, Muller Uys, Francois de Villiers, Stedman Gans, Jeanluc Cilliers.-MMASEKEPE MATSEBANE|mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
