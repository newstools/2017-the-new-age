The suspect in the murder case of one of the managers of the Sakhumzi restaurant in Orlando West, Soweto will remain in custody for another week while investigations continue after a brief appearance in the Orlando Magistrate s Court Wednesday.Njabulo Ngubane, 24, from Dube Hostel in Soweto, is one of the suspects linked to the killing of Khwesi Hudson last month at the famous restaurant. He is facing charges of murder and robbery with aggravated circumstances. He was apprehended in KwaZulu-Natal, he was arrested on Monday. The police were investigating the case and it led them to KwaZulu-Natal and they found that he was also arrested for another case of armed robbery, Soweto East police spokesperson Capt Nomvula Mbense said.During his appearance in court yesterday, prosecutor Nadine Franks requested that he remain in custody pending an investigation and that bail not be considered until a formal bail application has been launched. The matter was postponed to February 22.Another suspect is expected to appear in court today on charges of robbery that happened at the same restuarant in November last year, the police said. The link between the two robberies is yet to be established.The police said investigations were continuing and that more arrests relating to the murder case were imminent.A former colleague of Hudson, who did not want to be named for fear of victimisation said it was unexpected that the suspects had been linked to the killing as he knew and had worked with them at Sakhumzi at some point. He said he could not fathom what the motive for the robbery could have been.Hudson was killed when two males tried to force entry into the restaurant after hours.When he refused, he was shot several times. Hudson was born in Ghana and moved to South Africa in 1984 to pursue a career in teaching. He taught at two schools in the Eastern Cape and officially joined Sakhumzi in 2015, a move meant to grow his business.He will be buried in March in his home country Ghana.Sakhumzi s marketing manager Archie Tsoku said the arrest of the suspect came as a relief to both the staff at the restaurant and the family of the slain Hudson. He commended the police for the arrests and said he hoped justice would be served.lillians@thenewage.co.za
