In fact, oversized cuts are the first major trend to emerge for the fall/winter 2017 season.Topman Design went particularly big on oversized pieces, inspired by the grungy style of the 1990s.The collection included baggy denim pants with pockets on the sides matched with short jackets, plus large, loose, printed sweaters worn over baggy pants.The British label isn&#8217;t the only brand embracing the trend. Oversized cuts were also spotted at Craig Green, with king-sized padded jackets and pants, and at Astrid Andersen, on certain silhouettes in the label&#8217;s sportswear chic collection.JW Anderson even rolled out XXL dimensions to accessories.Seasonal color Although color is often less present in winter collections, bright, bolder-than-ever shades are on the agenda for fall/winter 2017-2018.Topman Design brought fluorescent pink, green, orange and yellow to the runway, while Liam Hodges reworked military styles with touches of fluorescent yellow and green. Christopher Shannon used bright, lively shades, while JW Anderson splashed the runway in a mix of vibrant hues, playing with colorful prints in &#8220;application&#8221; inspired motifs. Sibling used red, orange, white and midnight blue in geometric prints.Note that yellow and green &#8212; particularly Pantone&#8217;s color of the year, &#8220;Greenery&#8221; (PANTONE 15-0343 Greenery) &#8212; could shape up to be the shades of the season.
