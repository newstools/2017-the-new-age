The Emalahleni local municipality has vowed to continue strengthening its relationship with Eskom by generating more money and settling its outstanding electricity bill.This followed after the municipality had an unpaid account with the power utility amounting to almost R1bn.According to the municipality, a payment of R80m has already been made following the power utility s threat to switch-off power supply in the entire municipality if the amount was not paid by January 31.Thereafter the municipality admitted that it was struggling to make the payment because its clients including households, churches and business people owed the municipality about R2.2bn.A decision was then also made by the municipality to switch-off power supply to the clients failing to keep their accounts up to date so that the municipality would be able to pay its debt with Eskom.Municipal spokesperson Kingdom Mabuza said the leadership of the municipality was willing to make the remaining payment by implementing a positive strategy to collect the money from its clients.Mabuza said clients in the business sector owed the municipality an amount of R230m.He said the households also still needed to settle out the outstanding balance of R1.6bn in order for the municipality to continue providing services including electricity. In total, an amount of more than R80m has been paid to Eskom since the first notice of bulk disruptions were published by them. In addition, further payments towards the winter month arrears were made and a cogent payment proposal plan was duly submitted to Eskom showing how Emalahleni local municipality intends to deal with the nagging debt that now stands at R940m, Mabuza said.He said the municipality would continue to remain merciless on clients resisting to keep their accounts up to date by leaving them without electricity until the needed payments were made. To encourage this, the municipality is continuing with a robust cut-off programme as well as an incentive scheme and we call on everyone in the interest of the total community to come forward and commit themselves to their responsibilities, Mabuza said.However, the municipality is no stranger to poor provision of services due to financial issues and other related crises. Among others, it was lifted from administration a few weeks ahead of the 2016 local government elections.This occurred after it was put under administration for over a year by the provincial department of cooperative governance and traditional affairs as a result of wrongdoings such as financial mismanagement, nepotism, corruption and poor provision of services.The process saw the then executive mayor Salome Sithole being removed from her position before her term could expire and be replaced with Lindiwe Ntshalintshali who was also re-elected to continue holding the position when the ANC retained the administration control of the municipality after the elections.Recently, the municipality made headlines when opposition parties were calling on the cooperative governance and traditional affairs MEC Refilwe Mtshweni to intervene regarding the proposal of its council to purchase a R1.5m vehicle to be utilised by Ntshalintshali to execute her mayoral duties.It was alleged that the money to be used in the transaction was as a roll over into the 2016-17 financial year and was projected for the provision of services. The municipality then said the Toyota Lexus mayoral car had reached 124 813km and its motor plan had already expired.The plan was extended and cost the council about R43000.FRANCE NYAKAfrancen@thenewage.co.za
