The death threats made against outspoken African National Congress (ANC) MP Dr. Makhosi Khoza and her daughter were made by a 17-year-old minor female according to police minister Fikile Mbalula.Mbalula made the revelation during a press conference hosted during a visit to the infamous Glebelands hostel in KwaZulu-Natal.According to Mbalula the 17-year-old who made the threats is a grade 10 high school pupil from Gugulethu in Cape Town who has also made telephonic threats to other ministers including Communications Minister Ayanda Dlodlo and Social Development Minister, Bathabile Dlamini.&#8220;12 cellular phone numbers used to threaten people were successfully traced to her and her mother in Cape Town. Since August 2016 to date she has threatened and harassed about seven people serving or working at the National Assembly,&#8221; he said.Mbalula also added that 17-year-old who has been threatening the MP has links to opposition party the Democratic Alliance.&#8220;This evident from information posted on social networks but police do not yet have official proof of a DA membership,&#8221; said Mbalula.Back in July Khoza took to her Facebook page where she shared screen grabs of text messages sent to her cell phone calling for her death and threats also made against her daughter.At the time Khoza said the threats were emanating from factions within the ANC as a result of her criticism against President Jacob Zuma as well as her calls for him to step down.I am prepared to be punished for speaking out against wrong doings within the organisation. People of South Africa come first, and the ANC has a mandate to protect and uphold the Constitution, Khoza said at the time.Parliament later announced that appropriate security measures would be taken to protect Khoza.However Mbalula today said that investigations showed that the threats did not come from the ANC and thatHowever Mbalula today said that investigations showed that the threats did not come from the ANC and that Dr. Khoza had misled the public with her statements.&#8220;Dr. Khoza was not informing South Africans the truth or facts on this matter.These threats came from a troubled minor and she was not the only one threatened in this way. Dr. Khoza also periodically told the public about threats to her life but police could not identify the threat,&#8221; said Mbalula.Mbalula revealed that the minor was admitted to a place of safety in Elsies River, Cape Town last year after making false allegations that she was being trafficked for drugs and sex.-Siphiwe Mchunu
