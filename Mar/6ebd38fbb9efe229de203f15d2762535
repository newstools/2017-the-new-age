Millions of South Africans are drowning in debt with many losing their homes and cars.At least 5000 home owners who defaulted on mortgage payments have been booted out of their houses by banks in the last 12 months. More than 5000 people are foreclosed by the banks each year and 15000 are served with sale in execution notices, which is a prelude to the sale of the house at auction by the sheriffs, advocate Douglas Shaw, who has done a study on repossessions, said.Shaw estimates that properties worth R5bn are auctioned each year across the country at an average discount of 40% to fair market value.Debt counsellor Thabo Nguqu said the middle class and first-time buyers of both homes and cars were the biggest slaves to debt . It s mainly people between the ages of 25 and 45 years old who are over-indebted, she said.The Motor Finance Corporation said repossession of vehicles was much higher than that of houses.The MFC said it repossessed more than 7000 vehicles every year as defaulters struggle to pay while Standard Bank reclaimed up to 7500 cars annually.The National Credit Regulator s spokesperson, Lebogang Selibi, said almost 10 million South Africans half the national labour force were battling with over-indebtedness. Credit bureaus held records for 24.25 million credit-active consumers of which 59.4% (14.4 million) were in good standing and 40.6% (9.85 million) had impaired records, Selibi said.Institute for Race Relations spokesperson Mienke Mari Steytler said it had become evident that millions of South Africans could not live without credit and were falling further behind on their debt repayments, resulting in over-indebtedness.She said, in some instances, reckless lending by credit providers, a lack of knowledge on the part of consumers and a lack of responsibility were reasons for over-indebtedness.Susan Pretorius of Debt Solutions believes over-indebtedness is caused by the rise in living costs, failure to save for emergencies and retrenchment. People who could manage their debt repayments a year ago may not be able to still manage it today, Pretorius said.Selibi said that 534636 consumers were actively under debt counselling as at end of February. Debt counselling assists consumers to pay all credit providers they owe and it protects them against legal action from credit providers. Debt counselling was introduced to assist over-indebted consumers. Consumers usually pay reduced instalments under debt review and sometimes the interest is also reduced, she said.However, Pretorius said some defaulters shy away from debt review because of unscrupulous debt counsellors who did not always act in the best interests of their clients.MTHOKOZISI DUBE
