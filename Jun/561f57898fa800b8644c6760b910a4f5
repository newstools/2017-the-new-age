Domestic work has been mentioned in struggle songs, signifying the sort of employment most South African women raised their children on, from colonialism and apartheid to democracy. A pilot project in the Free State is set to change this profession through inspection.The Department of Labour nationally and in the Free State has realised the changes happening in the world of work. In response to this an innovation workshop was held to devise a means to address these changes in labour, especially for domestic workers.The workshop conceptualised a week-long plan which will see the department conducting inspections in the domestic sector of the Free State.Acting chief director of provincial operations for the Free State, Nomfundo Douw-Jack, said that domestic workers were the most valnarable and that their vulnerability was further exacerbated by the challenges related to inspectors lack of access to households of domestic employers.And this is the core of the pilot project intent where two inspection methodologies aimed at enhancing the efficiency of the inspection process will be undertaken. The first being a desktop inspection in which an inspection will be done by an inspector stationed at a Labour Centre.Inspection could be finalised without the inspector physically going to visit the employer, provided that all relevant information requested from the employer has been given and interviews will begin telephonically with both worker and employer.The second method of inspection will be the after-hours inspection. This will be a physical visit to an employer s household. Information will be requested during the visit with the exception of unemployment insurance as it will be required prior to the inspection. An interview with the employee is conducted in person if the domestic employee lives with the employer and telephonically if he/she commutes daily, the Department of Labour said.Provincial communication officer for the Free State department of labour, Josial Ramokoena, told the New Age that the sector has proven difficult as far as labour inspections were concerned. This is due to the fact that domestic employers are often employees themselves and therefore hard to find during normal working hours. Thus the department felt compelled to devise innovative ways to reach employers and employees in this sector, Ramokoena said.Ramokoena said that the two methods of inspection were being employed to gain insight into how they can help the department reach as many employers and employees as possible.Bloemfontein and Welkom were chosen due to the high concentration of domestic workers and are two big towns with a variety of economic activities Ramokoena said. Harrismith and Petrusburg made the grade as they represent small towns that have a lesser economic buzz.The vision, Ramokoena said, was to derive benefits emanating from the project, with the first being to use these methods to investigate the complexities of the sector.The inspections will ultimately be conducted to check with compliance with Sectoral Determination for the Domestic Sector, Unemployment Insurance Act and the Unemployment Insurance Contributions Act labour laws. When concluded the innovation pilot project will identify the most effective of the two methodologies will be used for future inspections in the domestic sector.Hloni Mashigoprovinces@thenewage.co.za
