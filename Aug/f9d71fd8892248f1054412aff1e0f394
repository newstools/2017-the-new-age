US President Donald Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-In on Sunday agreed that North Korea &#8220;poses a grave and growing direct threat,&#8221; in a phone call one day after the UN Security Council backed fresh sanctions on the North.&#8220;The two leaders affirmed that North Korea poses a grave and growing direct threat to the United States, South Korea, and Japan, as well as to most countries around the world,&#8221; the White House said of the call, in which the pair welcomed the sweeping sanctions.&#8220;The leaders committed to fully implement all relevant resolutions and to urge the international community to do so as well.&#8221;In a bid to pressure North Korea to abandon its nuclear missile program, Council members voted 15-0 for a partial ban on exports aimed at slashing Pyongyang&#8217;s foreign revenue by a third.Trump hailed the vote, thanking Russia and China for backing a measure that either could have halted with their UN veto.On Sunday, following his call with Moon the US president reiterated on Twitter that he is &#8220;very happy and impressed with 15-0 United Nations vote on North Korea sanctions.&#8221;The United States began talks on a resolution with China a month ago, after Pyongyang launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile on July 4, followed by a second ICBM test on July 28.But the measure does not provide for cuts to oil deliveries, which would have dealt a serious blow to the North&#8217;s economy.China accounts for 90 percent of trade with North Korea, and Beijing&#8217;s attitude to its volatile neighbor will be crucial to the success or failure of the new sanctions regime.-AFP
