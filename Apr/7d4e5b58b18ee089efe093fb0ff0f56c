Minister in the presidency Jeff Radebe, hailed winners of the South African Youth Awards 2017 at a prestigious event which celebrated the youth on Friday evening at the Saint George s Hotel conference centre.Radebe said the government was proud of the talented and dedicated young people in the country. This is an accolade you should not take lightly. The award affirms you as individuals who make a unique contribution to our society. You are recognised for what you bring to the world. As I said, winning an award is not the end of your journey. In fact, it is the beginning of a new chapter, he said.Lethabo Mokwena, 26, who walked away with an award for best entrepreneur said the recognition meant a lot for him and his team. The University of Johannesburg corporate communications graduate runs a shoe care business called Walk Fresh in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni.He started the business a month ago with his childhood friends Thabang Nkadimeng, 27, Ali Mosokwa, 28 and Tsolofelo Tlobolo, 29. They offer various services including sneaker cleaning, leather shoe care and polishing, suede and nubuck cleaning, as well as maintenance and colour correction and changing. I m finally beginning to feel like all the hard work we have put it being recognised. It was motivating because the judging panels included qualified people and that means we got the prize for people who knew our work. Mokwena and his team are selftaught and do their own research into shoe and sneaker care. He says he wants to have franchises for the company around the country. Mokwena said he could not believe that they came tops from the many other people who where nominated. Its shocking to believe we came top in the entire country. We look at it as the beginning, especially with the flagship store opening on April 15. Other categories included the private sector, public sector, entrepreneurship, social cohesion/civil society, health and well-being and arts and entertainment.DIKELEDI RAMABOPAkutullom@thenewage.co.za
