Gauteng Premier David Makhura has on Monday absolved the province&#8217;s Executive leadership saying the decision to transfer mental health patients to NGO&#8217;s was not taken in consultation with them.Makhura who on Monday was delivering the state of the Province address said that he, along with the executive council would have never approved such a move.&#8220;The executive council and I would have never approved a plan to outsource mental health, a primary responsibility of the state to take care of the most vulnerable in our society such as mental health patients,&#8221; Makhura said.&#8220;We would have never supported a decision to support this to NGO&#8217;s whether they would have been licensed or not,&#8221; he said.A report released by Health Ombudsman Prof Malegapuru Makgoba early this month found that the decision to relocate more than 1 300 patients from Esidimeni into 27 illegal NGOs was flawed and rushed.The report highlighted negligence in a damning report into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the mentally ill patients. Last week Makgoba revealed the number of deaths linked to Esidimeni s disaster was now above 100 and increasing.The Esidimeni tragedy has also had a number of ramifications for Makhura. Following the release of Makgoba&#8217;s report the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) called for Makhura to step down while the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) laid charges against the Premier.Makhura earlier stated that he was willing to appear before the provincial legislature s oversight committee after the Democratic Alliance s Jack Bloom wrote to the committee for the Premier s role to be probed following Makgoba s damning report.Meanwhile Makhura announced during the SOPA that memorial stones are to be erected at Freedom Park in Pretoria to honour victims of the Esidimeni tragedy.Makhura also announced a provincial wide probe of centers that provide care to mental patients, the elderly as well as children.&#8220;Whether these centers are licensed or not, we must ensure that they operate under conditions that are acceptable. It is our responsibility as the state to take care of the weak,&#8221; said Makhura.After the State Of The Nation Address (SONA) President Jacob Zuma indicated that a nation-wide probe into the nation s mental health sector and NGO s, should take place following the Life Esidimeni tragedy. We have taken a view along with the Minister of Health and in government that we want to go through nationally to check what is happening because the report was revealing, said Zuma.-TNA Reporter
