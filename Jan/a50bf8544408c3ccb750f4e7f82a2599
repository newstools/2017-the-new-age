Burkina Faso&#8217;s coach Paulo Duarte will draw confidence from a call from mentor Jose Mourinho on the eve of Wednesday&#8217;s African Nations Cup semi-final against Egypt, he said on Tuesday.&#8220;He is a friend, a father figure and one who over the years has changed the mentality of coaching football not only in Portugal but around the world.&#8220;His method of training, the dynamic he brings to clubs and his analysing of opponents have made him the leader of a generation of new trainers,&#8221; the 47-year-old Duarte told a pre-match news conference after being asked a question about his links with the Manchester United coach.&#8220;You are magician to ask me a question like that because he actually called me yesterday. He also called me the last time I was here in Gabon when we played a friendly match against Portugal,&#8221; explained Duarte, who was coach of Gabon before returning for a second spell as Burkina Faso coach.&#8220;He&#8217;s a friend. A great leader. We might speak only once or twice in a while but he is always willing to give advice.&#8221;Duarte&#8217;s last seasons as a player overlapped with the start of Mourinho&#8217;s coaching career at Uniao Leiria in Portugal.-Reuters
