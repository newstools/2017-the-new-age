Neymar hailed the best game of his career after Barcelona pulled off the greatest comeback in Champions League history by scoring three times in the dying minutes against a stunned Paris Saint-Germain.The Brazilian scored an 88th-minute free kick and a penalty in the 91st before setting up Sergi Roberto&#8217;s clincher in the fifth minute of injury time, sealing it 6-1 as Barcelona overturned a 4-0 first-leg deficit.The result, which sparked delirious celebrations at Barcelona&#8217;s 99,000-capacity Nou Camp stadium, sent the Spanish giants storming into the quarter-finals at the cost of the stricken Paris club.&#8221;This is the best game I have ever played. For what it meant, for what we experienced and because I am in great form,&#8221; Neymar told BeIN Sports.&#8220;I know that we have made history. A team like this can do anything.&#8221;The sensational win recalled Manchester United&#8217;s injury-time double to win the 1999 title against Bayern Munich in the same stadium, and Liverpool&#8217;s victory in the 2005 final after being 3-0 down to AC Milan at half-time.&#8220;It is a difficult night to explain with words,&#8221; said Barca boss Luis Enrique, who will leave the club at the end of the season.&#8221;It was a horror movie, not a drama, with a Camp Nou that I have seen very few times as a player or coach.&#8220;What defines this victory is the faith that the players and fans had.&#8221;But the defeat raised questions over the future of PSG coach Unai Emery, as club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi ominously called it &#8220;very hard to accept&#8221;.&#8220;This is a nightmare for everybody. Is Unai Emery still credible? This is not the moment to talk of this. After the game, we are all upset,&#8221; said the Qatari. Pique predicts baby boom Despite Luis Suarez&#8217;s early opener, a Layvin Kurzawa own goal and Lionel Messi&#8217;s penalty, Barca looked down and out when Edinson Cavani volleyed home what seemed to be the vital away goal for PSG.However, Neymar restored Barca&#8217;s belief as he firstly fired home a sensational free-kick two minutes from time and then converted from the penalty spot.And substitute midfielder Roberto became the unlikely hero when he stretched to turn home Neymar&#8217;s sublime chip over the defence, leaving the score 6-5 on aggregate as the crowd dissolved into ecstasy.&#8220;I threw myself at it with everything,&#8221; Roberto told BeIN Sports. &#8220;We left Paris very down and now this is incredible.&#8221;We were prepared for all this. The fans were like 10 extra players and in the end this is all for them.&#8221;Midfielder Ivan Rakitic said Barca had defied the critics after their first-leg humiliation in Paris three weeks ago.&#8221;It&#8217;s crazy. After Paris, many people spoke hard about our team but tonight was special, we made history,&#8221; the Croatian told BT Sport.&#8221;We know we are the best team in the world.&#8221;As well as staying on course for a sixth title, the 1992, 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2015 European champions set a new record by reaching their 10th straight quarter-final.PSG coach Emery admitted his team went to pieces in the final minutes, but said they were badly affected by the two second-half penalties given by German referee Deniz Aytekin.&#8220;In the second-half it changed. The (Messi) penalty got them off to a great start, but I was already calmer because I could see the team was responding better, were better positioned on the pitch and could do damage,&#8221; said the Spanish coach.&#8220;We had chances to make it 3-2 and then the refereeing decisions, I don&#8217;t know if they were right or not, but for sure they damaged us. Then in the last two minutes we lost everything we had recovered in the second-half.&#8221;Barcelona defender Gerard Pique, husband of Colombian pop star Shakira, predicted exuberant celebrations among the team&#8217;s fans.&#8220;I would say to the hospitals of Barcelona to hire nurses,&#8221; said the father of two. &#8220;Tonight people will make a lot of love.&#8221;-AFP
