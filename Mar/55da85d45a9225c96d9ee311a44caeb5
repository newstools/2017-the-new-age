President Zuma has on Monday appointed Dr Setlomamari Isaac Dintwe as the Inspector-General of Intelligence (IGI), almost two years since his predecessor’s term ended. Dintwe’s appointment brings to a close an arduous process to find a new inspector-general which last year had to be restarted after the ANC could not muster the required support in the National Assembly to have its candidate, former MP Cecil Burgess, appointed. “Dr Dintwe is currently employed by the University of South Africa as an Associate Professor of Forensic at College of Law, School of Criminal Justice. His nomination was approved by Parliament on 29 November 2016,” said Presidency spokesperson Bongani Ngqulunga. Early this month the Democratic Alliance (DA) called on Zuma to urgently fill the vacancy and appoint Dintwe. “This crucial position, created by section 210(b) of the Constitution, has now been vacant since March 2015. As a consequence, there has been no oversight of South Africa’s intelligence services for nearly two full years,” said DA Chief Whip John Steenhuisen. Dintwe is to serve as the Inspector-General of Intelligence for five years beginning on 15 March 2017. The previous IGI, Faith Radebe’s term came to an end in April 2015. Meanwhile Zuma will inspect the border separating South Africa with Swaziland and Mozambique following complaints by residents in the surrounding area about cross-border crime. In a statement issued by the Presidency, residents of the uMhlabuyalingana Local Municipality in northern KwaZulu-Natal have recently complained regarding high levels of stock theft and car hijackings. According to the statement, the crime has led to tensions between residents of the Municipality and foreign migrants. “The President will inspect the border, speak to the local police as well as engage with the communities of uMkhanyakude, Hlabisa and Jozini municipalities,” said Presidency spokesperson Dr Bongani Ngqulunga. -TNA Reporter
