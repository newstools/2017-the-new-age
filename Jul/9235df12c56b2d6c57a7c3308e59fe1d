The ANC appears to have joined the cry of thousands of South Africans who are upset over the high cost of data. Speaking during a ANC progressive business forum breakfast briefing, Economic Development minister Ebrahim Patel said the ruling party was looking at getting data costs down in the country. “We are a data-driven society. What oil and steel was to the 20th century, data is now the critical fuel and data costs must come down.” Patel also announced a market inquiry on how to reduce the cost of data was also on the cards. ANC Treasurer-General Zweli Mkhize echoed Patel’s sentiments saying South Africa should not lose out in the digital economy because of the high cost of data. Mkhize said the ANC should champion the #DataMustFall movement. “It’s an important issue because to ensure that current and future generations don’t lose out in the digital economy. There is a fourth revolution coming and it will be based on knowledge and digitisation,” said Mkhize. Last year the #DataMustFall campaign was a strong twitter trending topic. Radio Dj and businessman Thabo “Tbo Touch” Molefe was a champion of the movement and issued a warning to South African Cellular networks to do away with expensive mobile data. Parliament’s portfolio committee on telecommunications and postal services even held a two-day hearing on mobile data costs. South Africa has among the most expensive data in the world and demands for access are growing. Data prices are on average 134% more expensive than the cheapest prices in the Brics group, according to research company Tariffic. -TNA Reporter
