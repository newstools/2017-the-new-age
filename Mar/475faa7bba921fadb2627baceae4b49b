THE Department of Correctional Services (DCS) has warned job seekers of a scam where they are told that they have a job with the department in return for a fee.The DCS regional office in KZN has been inundated with phone calls from people claiming that they have been assured jobs by the department. Others have personally gone to the offices claiming they have paid to settle for a job.The job scammers have relationships with some of the print media to advertise jobs as DCS and that leads to the increase in job scam victims, department spokesperson Thulani Mdluli said. He said the department did not sell posts and furthermore the department is against this practice because it is a crime, irrespective of who commits it. The DCS pleads to the public that whoever promises any member of the public a job for monetary exchange should be reported to SAPS, he said. Mdluli urged anyone interested in DCS recruitment processes to contact GJ Mchunu for inquiries on 033 355 7386.LANGELIHLE CHAGWE
