Scores of people from all five districts of the province are expected to commemorate Human Rights Day at Matlerekeng village outside Marble Hall on March 21.The provincial government spokesperson Phuti Seloba, said buses to ferry people to the venue were being coordinated with local municipalities. Premier Stan Mathabatha will deliver the keynote speech. The intended outcome of Human Rights Day are to create public education and awareness about the rights of South Africans as enshrined in the Constitution, as well as to ensure that people can exercise their rights and responsibilities, Seloba said.Though the province is regarded as a peace den, there are some ugly incidents where the rights of people are trampled upon, apparently due to their skin colour or nationality.During this month, a black man was shot and wounded on a farm a Letsitele near Tzaneen by a white man who told police he thought he had aimed his pellet gun at a monkey.The incident was condemned by the community and political activists saying it bore the hallmarks of racism.In another incident last month, a black man was shot and killed in Modimolle by a farmer who told police he mistook him for a wild pig.This incident saw political foes, ANC and EFF, holding demonstrations side by side against a common cause opposing bail for the suspect who was eventually released on R5 000 bail.On the other hand, some white farmers claimed that attacks, robberies and killings targeting their farms were racially motivated as the perpetrators were usually blacks and the victims were whites.Police have since unofficially refrained from mentioning nationalities of suspected criminals, claiming that revealing their country of origin (in case of foreigners) inadvertently triggered xenophobic reprisals.Authorities have encouraged people to report any form of crime, including racially motivated incidents to police or to other human rights structures for investigation.MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
