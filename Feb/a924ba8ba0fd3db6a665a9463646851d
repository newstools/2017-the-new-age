PLANS are well under way to start with the building of a temporary taxi rank funded by the KwaDukuza municipality in the Ballito area.The facility will be built on the site meant for a permanent rank while the detailed design of the rank is finalised. The municipality said R3m from its reserves would be used for the opening of access roads, levelling of the site, building of stormwater drains and paying for engineering. The Ballito taxi rank permanent project will be budgeted during the 2017-18 financial year. The draft budget that will be adopted by council before March 31 will have a final figure for the project, municipality spokesperson Sifiso Zulu said.The municipality has appointed consulting engineers to work on the conceptualisation of the taxi rank, design, project management and contractor management. The municipal manager will finalise the appointment of the contractor this week. The appointed contractor is envisaged to conduct site establishment and thereafter start construction. Zulu said.The project is expected to take between six and eight weeks. We recognise that efficient public transport is the backbone of any thriving economy, therefore we wish to express our heartfelt gratitude to Shell South Africa for not opposing this process and we are at an advanced stage of finalising ownership, KwaDukuza mayor Ricardo Mthembu said.He said this was important especially because the municipality had inherited towns that were not designed for public transport facilities, particularly Ballito. KwaDukuza local municipality acquired land belonging to Shell South Africa through an expropriation process which measures about 5 130m . It took ownership of the land on January 3 this year.-TNA Reporter
