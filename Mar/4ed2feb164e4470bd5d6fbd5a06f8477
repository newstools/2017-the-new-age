Over the last three years, the company that began with Mickey Mouse has been the biggest earner in Hollywood. In 2016, it set a new record when it posted sales of US$7 billion, and Disney also has ambitious plans for 2017, which will really kick into gear with the upcoming release of a live-action &#8220;Beauty and the Beast&#8221;.However, given that it will only release eight features this year as opposed to 13 in 2016 there is a real risk that Disney will have to contend with lower sales. And if its performance at the box-office turns out to be disappointing, its profits will suffer even more. On the other hand, if audiences turn out in droves, 2017 could become another multi-billion dollar year, without even taking into account merchandising revenues.In 2016, Disney monopolized the top five global box office rankings thanks to the excellent results of &#8220;Captain America: Civil War,&#8221; &#8220;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,&#8221; &#8220;Finding Dory,&#8221; &#8220;Zootopia,&#8221; and &#8220;The Jungle Book.&#8221;&#8220;Beauty and the Beast&#8221; will be the first Disney film this yearThe studio will begin 2017 with the live action remake of the animated classic &#8220;Beauty and the Beast,&#8221; which will open in the United States on March 17. The company has very high hopes for this feature which stars Emma Watson, who rose to fame as Hermione in the &#8220;Harry Potter&#8221; saga.In the absence of an upset, the film will be a success in theaters. All the indicators provided by multiple extracts and trailers, as well as a considerable buzz on the web and social networks, are flashing green. The first trailer, which was viewed 127.6 million times in just 24 hours when it was released last November, was an unprecedented success.Disney also plans to cash in on good old recipes that have nourished sales in the more recent past. May will see the launch of the sequel to &#8220;Guardians of the Galaxy,&#8221; which brought in US$770 in 2014. Later that month, the &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean&#8221; franchise (which has accumulated $US3.7 billion) will return to the big screen with a fifth installment entitled &#8220;Dead Men Tell No Tales.&#8221;The third &#8220;Cars&#8221; opus to be released in June is expected to perform well, in view of the US$462 and US$560M generated by the first two installments. A new &#8220;Thor&#8221; set for release in October is also expected to contribute to revenues (in view of the US$450 and US$644 harvested by the first two chapters in this saga). An eighth episode of &#8220;Star Wars,&#8221; &#8220;The Last Jedi,&#8221; which will close out the year in December, may bring in as much as US$2 billion in box-office sales worldwide.All of these films will likely win top box office rankings in 2017. At the same time, Disney also plans to release a new Pixar Studios 3D animation film, Coco in November. Over the last ten years, previous collaborations between the two studios have brought in an average of US$800 million per film, however, it remains to be seen if this latest venture will enjoy success on this scale.Finally, the company will complete its line-up of new offerings with &#8220;Born in China,&#8221; a wildlife documentary (to be released on April 27), which, in view of its genre, is expected to generate much more modest sales than the studio&#8217;s other productions.-Relaxnews
