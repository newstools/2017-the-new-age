South Africa s smallholder farmers have been challenged to take advantage of access to Chinese markets following last month s agreement that allows the country toto the east Asia country.The Protocol on the Export of South African Beef to China and a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on the entry and exit of animals and inspection quarantine was signed last month during the launch of Operation Phakisa on agriculture, land reform and rural development by President Jacob Zuma.The move is part of the government s plans to enhance and transform the country s agricultural sector as well as accelerate land reform to ensure an inclusive rural economy.China-based agricultural economics and management masters student, Buyambo Mantashe believes allowing South African beef to be exported to China could not have come at a better time for the South African beef industry. The beauty of it is that the news comes at the end of a dreadful drought in 2016, Mantashe said. The recent increase in beef prices in December shows that the worst could be over for the industry and the exposure to a market of China s magnitude is another positive boost. South Africa is just coming out of its worst drought in many decades. Tens of thousands of cattle died due to the drought.Mantashe has warned that while the signing of the protocols was a development worth celebrating, it demanded a deep understanding of the Chinese beef market. The road to success depends on three factors, which are understanding the Chinese market, competitive positioning and the ability to navigate the regulatory environment, he said.Australia, Brazil, Uruguay, New Zealand and Argentina are some of China s leading suppliers of beef.China-based economics student Botlhale Seageng said smallholder farmers could use established government entities to promote their products in China. The beef industry must use government entities such as Brand SA and South Africa Airways (SAA) to promote their products, as that will provide credibility, Seageng said.He said the 2014 declaration by the International Animal Health Organisation that South Africa is foot and mouth disease (FMD) free has played an integral role in increasing South African exports into more lucrative markets such as Vietnam, the United Arab Emirates and other countries in Africa.In 2015, the production of beef amounted to approximately 740 thousand tons from 3 million slaughtered cattle.More than 25000 tons was exported at the value of R350m.MTHOKOZISI DUBEmtokozisid@thenewage.co.za
