Many South Africans reach for their smartphones as soon as they wake up while others take their phones into the bathroom, a report published by Effective Measure titled Mobile in South Africa Report for 2017, said.The results shows increasing numbers of people are holding their lives in the palms of their hands. The report itself shows that 70% of respondents browse the web on their mobiles, while 44% surf the web in bed and a further 35% of them go one step further and reach for their smartphones as soon as they wake up. And if that s not already cause for concern, on average 13% of users also take out their phones in the bathroom but probably not to use Snapchat as the report said only 2% of respondents use the application on their phones, the report showed.The report shows outside of the household, road safety appears to have prevailed with the percentage of respondents using their phones while driving having dropped from 12% in 2015 to 5% in 2016. Workplace productivity is also supposedly on the rise with smartphone use at work dropping dramatically from 66% to 29%. In terms of what s compelling users to pick up their phones, the report said 59% are making calls, 44% are receiving calls and 40% are accessing the world wide web.The most popular reported uses of the web are Whatsapp, SMS and Facebook messenger, which are used by 83%, 51% and 40% of smartphone users respectively. This suggests that the phone s original core function of communication hasn t followed in the footsteps of the Tamagotchi and is still far from becoming redundant in today s smartphones. We started this research because we know professionally and personally how integrated mobile phones are in our lives. What we don t really know is how South Africans in particular use their smartphones. These insights highlight how South Africans are changing as consumers, Greg Mason, sub-Saharan Africa regional MD of Effective Measure, said. Over 4 990 respondents were surveyed from November 2016 to January this year.-INDIE BOYCE|indiphileb@thenewage.co.za
