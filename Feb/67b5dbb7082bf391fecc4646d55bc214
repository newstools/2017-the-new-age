THE South African Post Office (Sapo) has warned members of the public against a syndicate scamming unsuspecting clients to take away their hard earned cash. Sapo says the modus operandi of the syndicate involves gaining telephonic and email contacts of the clients of Lesotho Postal Service.They are then contacted by imposters who claim to be SA Post Office employees and informed that a parcel was ready for collection or delivery.Clients are, however, informed the parcel would only be released once a certain amount of money has been paid.Instances have been reported where clients were required to pay an amount of R2 500. Sapo spokesperson Martie Gilchrist warned members of the public to be on the alert when they received such communications. The SA Post Office and the Lesotho Postal Services do not require customers to make any deposit of funds into bank accounts before releasing parcels. Formal procedures are followed to inform clients of a parcel that is to be collected, Gilchrist said.She said members of the public who had information should call the police or Sapo s crime hotline on 0800 020 070. The SA Post Office advises the public to ignore communications of this nature, Gilchrist said. The public has been urged to be vigilant and not unwittingly be enticed into depositing any money on receiving such calls. If in doubt, call your local post office or the customer services help desk, A concerned client in Rondebosch, Mpho Diale, said: This scam has to be tackled as soon as possible before people get themselves into serious traps. Sapo should attend to this and bring all those involved to book. How are clients going to know the real deal? They must employ more people to work with the police in tracing where this syndicate operates from. -MPUMI KIVA
