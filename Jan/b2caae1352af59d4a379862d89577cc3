Police in Tshwane have arrested a car guard for attempted theft on Sunday after he was found locked inside a shopper s vehicle.The 22-year-old owner of the vehicle had parked his car in Burnett Street in Hatfield. He tried to lock his vehicle but the remote control device was giving him problems. He left his vehicle for a few minutes and when he returned, he found a man inside his vehicle looking for items to steal, police spokesperson Capt Colette Weilbach said.Weilbach said the motorist remained clearheaded and used the remote control to lock the man inside the vehicle. The motorist contacted Brooklyn police who arrested the 33-year-old suspect upon arrival, she said.Weilbach said nothing was stolen and the man appeared in the Hatfield Community Court on Monday on a charge of attempted theft out of a motor vehicle.Police have warned motorists visiting shopping centres to be wary of the use of remote control jamming devices by criminals. The criminals use radio transmitters to interrupt the signal emitted from a car remote to jam the locking system.Weilbach advised motorists to physically check whether their car doors are locked before walking away from their vehicles. Drivers must not assume their vehicles are locked when a remote control is used, even when they park their vehicles in shopping malls or controlled parking areas, she said. When a remote control device is giving problems, motorists must rather drive away to a safe location where the functioning of the remote control can be tested, she said. To prevent theft out of a motor vehicle and smash-and-grab incidents, motorists are advised to lock all loose items inside the boot at all times. She said visible loose items in a car created an opportunity for would-be criminals. Residents are urged to report any suspicious persons, vehicles or circumstances to the police immediately.Carjammers can reportedly earn up to R15000 a week.KUTULLO MADISHA
