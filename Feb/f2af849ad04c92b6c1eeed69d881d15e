South African Social Services Agency (SASSA) is set to approach the Concourt requesting an extension to its current illegal contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) in order to be able to pay 17 million social grant recipients on 1 April.SASSA CEO Thokozani Magwaza on Wednesday made the startling revelation before parliaments social development portfolio committee.In April 2014, the Constitutional Court ordered the Department of Social Services to take over payments of social grants due to irregular tender processes in appointing CPS.The startling announcement was made with Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini noticeably absent from the briefing she was meant to attend.This is the second time Dlamini snubs the committee as the briefing should have taken place last week, but was postponed.Last month, Minister Dlamini and her director-general, Zane Dangor, told Parliament that the 17 million recipients of social grants would be paid in April 2017.On Wednesday Magwaza reiterated the commitment to ensuring payment, however this now depends on whether the Concourt grants the extension.&#8220;We will approach the Concourt this week to ask for an extension of CPS the services,&#8221; said Magwaza.Executive manager of strategy and business development at SASSA Raphaahle Ramokgopa admitted that for the next two years SASSA would have a fragmented payment system.&#8220;In the long term we will have our own payment system, with our own card system which we intend to phase-in by 2019,&#8221; said Ramokgopa.Opposition MPs came down harshly on SASSA&#8217;s top brass for the mismanagement of the payment system.&#8221; What have you been doing for last 4 years? You&#8217;ve not approached treasury and have not approached court. This is a crisis,&#8221; said Liezl Van der Merwe of the IFP.-TNA Reporter
