Furthermore, he had approached the curator of his estate to request funds to pay for his legal fees.Meanwhile, Krejcir is currently facing a number of charges in separate matters including the murder of Sam Issa.He is currently serving a 35 year prison sentence in the Pretoria maximum prison.Radovan Krej due back in court-TNA Reporter
