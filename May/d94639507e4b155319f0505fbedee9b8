An Egyptian once believed to be the &#8216;world&#8217;s heaviest woman&#8217; left an Indian hospital Thursday for the United Arab Emirates where she will continue treatment following drastic weight-loss surgery, doctors said.Eman Ahmed Abd El Aty weighed roughly 500 kilograms when she arrived in Mumbai in February, but has shed an astonishing 323 kilograms since undergoing a series of medical procedures.With her weight now standing at 176.6 kilograms, she will begin a year-long course of physiotherapy at VPS Burjeel hospital in Abu Dhabi, her doctors in Mumbai said.&#8220;We have arranged for a hydraulic stretcher from Italy for Eman&#8217;s journey and she will have doctors, paramedics and nurses with her during the journey,&#8221; Sanet Meyer, director of medevac at VPS Burjeel, told AFP.Abd El Aty was put on a special liquid diet in India to reduce her weight enough so that doctors could perform bariatric surgery.The stomach-shrinking bypass procedure is increasingly common in India, which has a growing problem with obesity, particularly in urban areas.She had not left her home in Egypt&#8217;s Mediterranean port city of Alexandria for two decades until she arrived in India on a specially-modified Airbus plane in February.Her family told doctors that as a child she was diagnosed with elephantiasis, a condition that causes the limbs and other body parts to swell, leaving her almost immobile.Abd El Aty has suffered a stroke and faced a series of other serious ailments owing to her weight including diabetes, high blood pressure, hypertension and sleep deprivation.She is unable to speak properly and is partially paralysed.India is a major destination for medical tourists seeking quality services and no waiting lists at a fraction of the cost of western countries.-AFP
