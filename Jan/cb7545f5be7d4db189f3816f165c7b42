A Ford Kuga owner is lucky to be alive after his vehicle caught fire in Alberton last week. Warren Krog was on his way to work in Germiston when he noticed smoke coming out of the car and decided to take it to a nearby Ford dealership, The vehicle was emitting smoke from the engine for quite some time and I decided that it was safer to take it straight to Ford, Krog told the Alberton Record. As I turned the corner on the Voortrekker Road offramp, the smoke intensified. He said that he pulled over when the fire became worse, taking valuable items such as his laptop and identity documents with him. Krog said that when the fire department and paramedics arrived at the scene the car was engulfed in flames.He is the latest in a line of Ford Kuga owners whose vehicles have caught fire since last year. Reshall Jimmy from Johannesburg died in 2015 when his Kuga caught fire while driving between George and Knysna. The company has said that it s still waiting for evidence from the police about his death. Despite this, Ford SA says it is not recalling the affected model.Instead, the company has advised drivers to book their vehicles in for a free maintenance check as it believes there may be an issue with the engine overheating. This week, the National Consumer Commission which had a meeting with Ford in December said that it was yet to sift through hundreds of complaints received from the public during the festive season. Some frustrated Kuga drivers have taken to the social media to voice concerns about their safety.-TNA Reporter
