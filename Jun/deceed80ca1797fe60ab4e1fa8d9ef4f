The DA’s court bid to stop Brian Molefe from returning to work at Eskom has been postponed indefinitely pending the outcome of his Labour Court action to have his removal declared unlawful. Molefe’s legal representative Barry Faber confirmed the postponement outside the North Gauteng High Court. “The matter was postponed by consent. The postponement was made an order of court by agreement with all parties, pending the outcome of the Labour Court hearing,” Faber said. The DA’s James Selfe also confirmed the postponement saying ” The DA will seek to intervene in the Labour Court matter; and should Mr Molefe be successful in the Labour Court, the DA will set down our application to interdict Mr Molefe’s continued employment at Eskom.” The DA was today seeking an order that Molefe would not attend work at the Eskom head office or at any of its sites, for the purpose of performing any duties, subject to the completion of his Labour Court matter where after the DA’s review application would be set down for hearing. On Monday Molefe’s urgent application in the Labour Court was not heard and it remains unclear when the matter will be heard. Selfe said he was also not sure when the Labour Court proceedings will begin but confirmed they were preparing papers to apply to intervene as an interested party. Earlier today Legal analyst Nwora Okonkwo said the DA’s court bid is premature. -TNA Reporter
