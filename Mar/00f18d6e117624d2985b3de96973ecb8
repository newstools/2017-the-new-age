President Jacob Zuma led the list of tributes for fallen liberation stalwart Ahmed Kathrada when the nation woke up to the sombre news of his death yesterday morning.The 87 year old struggle icon died in his sleep at the Donald Gordon Hospital.The president has instructed that the national flag fly at half mast throughout the country from yesterday until this evening. President Zuma sends his deepest condolences to former minister of public enterprises Barbara Hogan, (Kathrada s partner) the Kathrada family and his political home, the African National Congress (ANC), which Uncle Kathy served selflessly throughout his adult life, Zuma s spokesperson, Bongani Ngqulunga, said.Long time friend and Rivonia trial lawyer advocate George Bizos said Kathrada was one of the smartest prisoners the apartheid regime ever came across.Kathrada had an extraordinary sense of humour and he was thankful to have known someone of Kathy s calibre, Bizos said.Fellow Rivonia trialist Denis Goldberg, said that South Africans should learn from Kathrada s values.Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa described the death as a huge loss to all South Africans. He will be remembered as an unassuming freedom fighter whose wisdom, tolerance, humility, steadfastness and humour earned him the love and respect of our people, Ramaphosa said.Political movements and civil society at large also offered their messages of support, led by his political home, the ANC.The ANC described Uncle Kathy as a person who was tolerant and completely principled.It said the Robben Island prisoner s life is a lesson in humility, tolerance, resilience and a steadfast commitment to principle, even when taking a principled stance would place him at odds with his comrades .The ruling party underlined that Kathrada s writings will continue to educate future generations about the liberation struggle.ANC acknowledged that even though there were tough times within the ruling party s leadership, Kathrada remained a loyal member. Despite disagreements with the ANC leadership from time to time, he never abandoned or turned his back on the ANC and always affirmed that the ANC, and the ANC alone, was the only political organisation that reflected the values and aspirations of all South Africans, the party said.The ANC Youth League (ANCYL) said the country had lost a father figure who had been dedicated to the liberation struggle.Leader of the Democratic Alliance (DA) Mmusi Maimane described Kathrada as one who had a profound sense of compassion. He embodied an unwavering commitment to true justice. As a leader at the forefront of the struggle for liberation, Kathrada relentlessly fought for the freedoms we all cherish today, Maimane said.The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) urged South Africans to learn from Kathrada s selflessness contribution to the liberation struggle. As a country, we must all learn from the selflessness of Uncle Kathy, always prioritising the marginalised and ensuring that their voices are heard and respected. We must adopt an uncompromising posture at all times in the fight against corruption, as he did, the EFF said. We must be prepared to pay even with our lives and imprisonment, if needs be, as he did. -REGOMODISTWE MPUTLE
