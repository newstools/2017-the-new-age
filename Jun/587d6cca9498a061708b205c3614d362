Despite numerous appeals and warnings by the police and community leaders in the province urging people to stop taking the law into their own hands by killing or assaulting suspected criminals, the scourge seems to go unabated.In the latest incident, a 28 year old woman was dragged from her house in Botlokwa by a mob and taken to an area where she was severely assaulted at the weekend. Police were called in and took her to the hospital but Ngwakoana Mokgokong later succumbed to her multiple severe body injuries. The motive behind this incident is not clear but she earlier opened a case of malicious damage to property against some residents, police spokesperson Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe said.The police have since arrested two men aged 32 and 34 on charges including murder, kidnapping and public violence.In another act of mob justice, three men accused of being involved in criminal activities were cornered and severely beaten by an enraged mob at the corner of Rissik and Nelson Mandela streets in the Polokwane CBD.The police managed to rescue the trio from their attackers but one died in hospital. The deceased is unknown and the other two are still recuperating in hospital with multiple assault wounds throughout their bodies. Nobody has been arrested yet and investigations are under way. Acting provincial police commissioner Maj-Gen Jan Scheepers expressed shock and disbelief at the brutality that characterised the killings in the two incidents. People should refrain from taking the law into their hands but rather arrest suspected persons and call the police or bring them to police stations. Those engaging in mob violence against suspects are becoming criminals themselves. MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
