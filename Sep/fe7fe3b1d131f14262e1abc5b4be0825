NORTH West s South African Trade Union (Saftu) says they are frustrated with the rampant corruption in the province and that the provincial government is not helping to stamp it out.This comes as the trade federation declared war on corruption in South Africa and in particular, the North West. Last month. Saftu said people in the province have been severely effected by corruption amid the high unemployment rate. In terms of getting employment in this province, only those aligned to a particular faction within the ANC would be employed, even without the necessary qualifications, Saftu North West provincial convenor Puseletso, Molise said.Molise referred to the prominent tender irregularity case surrounding Kwane Capital. In media reports it was alleged that the company s director, Mcebisi Mlonzi, and his associate ANC Youth League (ANCYL) leader Collen Maine paid Mahikeng municipal manager Thabo Mokena R10m in advance in order to secure a multi-million rand tender on the same day of registration on the municipal supplier database.Mlonzi is facing a probe by the special investigating unit over a R92m tender in the Eastern Cape. He now faces a Hawks probe over the R165m leasing contract.Molise said Mokena had earlier been recommended by Maine during the local government s national executive committee.In the media report, it said documents revealed how Kwane Capital went from applying for registration on the database on December 15, 2015 to receive the first upfront payment for a contract that had not been advertised just eight days later, on December 23. This example reveals just how blatant and shameless corruption has become, Molise said. He said he had personally written to Premier Supra Mahumapelo to address all matters of corruption. The office of the premier told us that they needed proof of corruption and to identify the specific incidents where we believe corruption has taken place. Molise said the establishment of a commission of inquiry into state capture should not deviate from former public protector Thuli Madonsela s recommendations.Attempts to get a comment from the office of the premier and the ANCYL proved unsuccessful.REFILWE MAGASHULE refilwem@thenewage.co.za
