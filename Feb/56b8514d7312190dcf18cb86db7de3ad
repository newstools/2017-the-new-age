Kaizer Chiefs defender Lorenzo Gordinho hopes the experience he gained in Europe during his trial with Denmark side Aalborg last month will help him to improve and become a better player.Gordinho embarked on the one-week trial in the hope of impressing and securing a contract with the Danish outfit.But it wasn t to be for the defender and he has since returned to the PSL to continue with his duties at Amakhosi.However, the 22 year old said he had learnt a lot of lessons in Scandinavia, which would help him. The experience was good. It taught me a lot especially mentally and the way they hold themselves over there. It was a good experience something that I will carry with me and something that has become part of me, he said. I got a taste of what it is like there. In comparison to Chiefs it s very similar. All that is different is the players and the way things are run but compared to what we have at home, we are on the right track. Having failed to impress Aalborg, the centre-back insists he was not disappointed about not joining them and his focus now is on Chiefs as he looks to cement his place. That s football. If you go to a trial and you don t make it maybe at that time the club was not looking at me to come on board and that s not the end of the world.Now I m back home and looking to fight for my position at the club. Gordinho has been one of the outstanding players for Chiefs this season and feels his understanding with coach Steve Komphela has been the reason for his success. I just think we have an understanding and he understands me as a player, Gordinho said. He is giving me a chance to show myself and improve. I just think with that, I have to repay him. That s why I have been working so hard, to repay his faith in me. Chiefs will resume their Absa Premiership campaign against Free State Stars tomorrow at FNB Stadium.NEVILLE KHOZAnevillek@thenewage.co.za
