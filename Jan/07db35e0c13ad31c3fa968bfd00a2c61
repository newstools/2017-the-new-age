Portugal&#8217;s former president Mario Soares, widely seen as the father of the country&#8217;s modern-day democracy, died Saturday aged 92 in Lisbon, a fortnight after being admitted to hospital.The founder of Portugal&#8217;s Socialist party, Soares spent decades in politics, serving as president from 1986 to 1996. He also served as foreign minister, prime minister and as a European lawmaker.He was admitted to hospital on December 13, and although his condition initially showed signs of some improvement, he later fell into a deep coma from which he never recovered.The hospital did not reveal the precise cause of Soares&#8217;s death, but relatives say he never fully overcame a spate of illness in 2013. His health further deteriorated after his wife&#8217;s death in July 2015.Born in Lisbon on December 7, 1924, Mario Alberto Nobre Lopes Soares was raised in a family opposed to the dictatorship of Antonio Oliveira Salazar.His father Joao Soares, a defrocked priest, struggled against the regime for decades, suffering long periods of imprisonment and exile.Reassuringly portly, Mario Soares was both a charmer and a humanist known for being spontaneous and warm.A self-defined agnostic, Soares said he believed in &#8220;humanity and its improvement&#8221;, and described himself as being driven by &#8220;a great desire to live and by immense curiosity.&#8221;&#8220;I am a poor man who has been fortunate to have taken stands and to have been right,&#8221; he told the &#8220;i&#8221; daily in February 2015, rejecting the idea he was an &#8220;immortal&#8221; figure.&#8211; Critic of spending cuts &#8211;Several politicians, including President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa and Prime Minister Antonio Costa visited Soares in hospital in recent weeks.&#8220;There are certain figures who have made their mark &#8230; on our democracy. We don&#8217;t need to have the same political leanings to recognise what they have done for our democracy,&#8221; conservative leader Rebelo de Sousa said at the time.Lisbon&#8217;s Socialist mayor Fernando Medina had also visited Soares&#8217;s bedside.&#8220;My generation has always lived in freedom and we owe that, to a great extent, to Mario Soares,&#8221; Medina said.While the former president retired from public life for several months after a crushing election defeat in 2006, he reappeared regularly in the media to comment on current affairs.He emerged as a fierce critic of the steep spending cuts Portugal was forced to implement under a 78-billion-euro bailout deal reached in 2011 with the EU and IMF to avert bankruptcy.Soares accused big European nations at the time of being guided by &#8220;savage capitalism&#8221;.He made a final public appearance in July, when he attended a ceremony held in his honour by the ruling Socialist-led government.Visibly frail, he did not make a speech.-AFP
