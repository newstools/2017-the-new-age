The ANC Youth League disrupted former finance minister Pravin Gordhan&#8217;s speech at Ahmed Kathrada&#8217;s memorial service in Durban, Kwa-Zulu Natal on Sunday. Gordhan was addressing the memorial reflecting on radical economic transformation.&#8220;Comrade Kathrada and his generation also wants radical economic transformation. It can&#8217;t be for the handful of people, it must be for all of us.&#8221;&#8220;Radical economic transformation must mean that our families particularly our african families don&#8217;t pass poverty from father to child, they must start passing wealth from father to child,&#8221; said Gordhan.The chaos began when a section of ANCYL members started interrupting Gordhan s speech. The members sang :&#8221;We Gordhan awephendule wenzeni uZuma? ( asking what the president has done?).Economic Development MEC Sihle Zikalala in Kwa-Zulu Natal tried to calm the fury crowd of ANCYL comrades, the tension was resolved. Comrades please sit down all of you.Comrade with red t-shirt you must go out or you must be disciplined,&#8221; said Zikalala.-Mboneni Shabalala
