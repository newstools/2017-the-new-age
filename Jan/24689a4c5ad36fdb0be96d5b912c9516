South Korea said Tuesday that US president-elect Donald Trump had sent a &#8220;clear warning&#8221; to North Korea with a tweet dismissing Pyongyang&#8217;s ballistic missile claims.&#8220;North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the US,&#8221; Trump tweeted. &#8220;It won&#8217;t happen!&#8221;Trump&#8217;s tweet came a day after North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un appeared to try to pressure the incoming president by announcing his country is in the &#8220;final stages&#8221; of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).Kim also said his country had significantly bolstered its nuclear arsenal last year.Washington has repeatedly vowed that it would never accept North Korea as a nuclear-armed nation, but Trump has not previously clearly stated his policy on the isolated Stalinist state.&#8220;President-elect Trump&#8217;s message is significant since it is his first mention of North Korea&#8217;s nuclear programme and can be seen as a clear warning,&#8221; South Korean foreign ministry spokesman Cho June-Hyuck told a briefing.Cho said the incoming US administration was clearly aware of the &#8220;gravity and urgency&#8221; of Pyongyang&#8217;s nuclear threat thanks to South Korea&#8217;s &#8220;active outreach&#8221;.US policy on the North would remain largely unchanged, he said.&#8220;They are maintaining an unwavering stance on the need for sanctions on North Korea,&#8221; Cho said.In a New Year&#8217;s speech on Sunday, Kim did not make a specific reference to the incoming Trump administration. But he called on Washington to make a &#8220;resolute decision to withdraw its anachronistic hostile North Korea policy&#8221;.Analysts are divided over how close Pyongyang is to realizing its full nuclear ambitions, especially as it has never successfully test-fired an ICBM.However, it carried out two nuclear tests and numerous missile launches last year alone in pursuit of its oft-stated goal &#8212; developing a weapons system capable of hitting the US mainland with a nuclear warhead.-AFP
