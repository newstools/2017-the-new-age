It was tough and the conditions as well. This year the wind was strong and it was in your face. I m quite happy with my performance. Sussie was close to me. I think her race was a lot better than she realises and all credit to her, I think she will be on top in the near future. In the male category, French triathlete Romain Guillame took first place in 4 hours, 8 minutes and 57 seconds.Two local favourites James Cunnama and Kyle Buckingham took second and third place.

The event is an important cog in the economy of Buffalo City.Ironman spokesperson Micheal Flanagan says millions of rands are spent in the city. It s a big money spinner for us.
