Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga s first inaugural state of the capital address (Soca) turned into chaos after angry ANC councillors said the choice of date was insensitive to the commemoration of former Umkhonto we Sizwe hero Solomon Mahlangu.The Tshwane event centre was turned into a shambles as metro police tried to remove councillors who refused to leave the meeting.ANC caucus spokesperson Lesego Makhubela regarded the event as an act of political murder, which was commissioned by the founder of the DA, apartheid judge Ramon Leon.Leon, who sentenced Mahlangu to death 38 years ago, was former DA leader Tony Leon s father. It is no accident that the Botha-Vorster fascist regime chose this day for this heinous crime against our people and the rest of humanity. On April 6, 1652, 300 years ago, Jan van Riebeeck landed at the Cape of Good Hope, heralding the beginning of the dark era of colonial subjugation and plunder in South and southern Africa. With the passage of time the people of this region were progressively reduced to a status of colonial vassals serving the interests of the imperialist oppressors and their hangers on, Makhubela said.He said the ANC described the timing of the Soca as an act of provocation aimed at continuing to sow racial conflict. Speaker Rachel Mathebe adjourned the mayor s address following continuous disruptions from ANC councillors.Msimanga said the ANC had completely undermined the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. This is symptomatic of an ANC in complete chaos as they continue to reach new lows. Their request was denied by the council, which resolved that the Soca would continue as scheduled in honour of Solomon Mahlangu and the ideals he fought for to liberate our people from the throes of poverty and destitution. The ANC must remember that a decision of the council is binding, he saidMsimanga said yesterday also served as the day which the South African government then and the ANC 23 years ago announced the first non-racial election would take place. Within the next financial year the city is looking to create 23000 EPWP job opportunities for our people to alleviate the burden of poverty, he said.He also said the city had made an initial R13m investment into the restoration of water infrastructure in the last two months and had tendered a R2bn contract to refurbish, upgrade and replace some of the ailing infrastructure that had been neglected.kutullom@thenewage.co.za
