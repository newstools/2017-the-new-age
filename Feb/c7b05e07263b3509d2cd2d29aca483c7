The best way to get spectrum in the near term is re-farming allocated spectrum bands and entering into roaming agreements with those who have capacity as it is very unlikely that new spectrum allocations will materialise in the near future, an analyst said yesterday.Peter Takaendesa, investment analyst at Mergence Investment Managers, was commenting on concerns raised by Vodacom about the unavailability of spectrum, which was further delayed by the publication of the White Paper in October. Vodacom released its December quarter trading update yesterday with the CEO, Shameel Joosub, raising concerns about spectrum. The unavailability of spectrum, further delayed by the publication of the White Paper by the ministry of telecommunications and postal services last year, remains a concern, he said. We have been involved in a number of positive engagements with relevant industry stakeholders as we seek to find a workable solution to make broadband even more accessible and affordable for South Africans. This is the express objective of the White Paper and Vodacom is aligned with this goal. On this, Takaendesa said he didn t see the spectrum allocations happening soon. On longer term plans there has to be a good balance between promoting competition and allocating spectrum to companies that have the resources to use the scarce resource effectively, he said.He also said operators can help speed up the process of spectrum allocation by providing all the required information to the regulators as well as complying with the key requirements such as empowerment of previously disadvantaged groups. On its performance for the quarter under review, the operator managed to offset a decline in customer numbers and revenue outside SA by growing its home market.The December quarter trading update shows that the drop in customer numbers outside SA meant Vodacom s overall active customer number fell by 64000 to 65.2-million during 2016. Vodacom had 36.4 million active customers in SA at December 31, an increase of 2.3 million, or 6.7%, from the end of 2015.-Samuel Mungadze|samuelm@thenewage.co.za
