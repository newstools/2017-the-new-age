Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied any wrongdoing Monday ahead of his expected questioning by police in a graft probe, telling his political opponents to put any &#8220;celebrations&#8221; on hold.&#8220;We hear all the media reports. We see and hear the festive spirit and atmosphere in television studios and in the corridors of the opposition,&#8221; Netanyahu told lawmakers from his Likud party, according to a video posted to his Facebook page.&#8220;I want to tell them to wait for the celebrations. Do not rush. I told you and I repeat: There will be nothing because there is nothing. You will continue to inflate hot air balloons and we will continue to lead the state of Israel.&#8221;-AFP
