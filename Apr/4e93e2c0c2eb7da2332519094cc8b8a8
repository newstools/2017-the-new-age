For as long as Kaizer Chiefs keep in touch with the pace setters in the race for the PSL title this season, all is well with veteran defender Tsepo Masilela.By defeating defending champions Mamelodi Sundowns 2-1 on Saturday, Amakhosi proved they are a team to be taken seriously in the title race. With eight matches remaining before the season ends and five clubs still in with a chance to win the title, Masilela said they needed to keep up with the chasing pack. I think we ve got five teams or more challenging for the title. It is not a race of two, normally it s two or three, Masilela said. But this one is tough because if you drop points you don t expect the other teams to drop points as well. Three teams might win on the day. Chiefs were second on the PSL log standings before last night s match between fellow title hopefuls Cape Town City and Chippa United at Athlone Stadium.But the 31-year-old defender is pleased with where Chiefs are at this stage of the season and said it will become clear who the clear favourites are by the end of the month. We are not in a bad position, what s good is that we are in the race and we want to stay there going towards May and the last game of the season. We are not calculating the points yet. We just have to play our game, it s very tough at the top. We have to collect points and see what happens. As long as we are still in the race we fancy our chances. If the points difference is five or four and there are six matches to go, why not fancy our chances? But being in this position, we want to take it one game at a time and try to win our games. As coach Steve Komphela said, by the end of April the picture should be more clear on who will win the title. Chiefs will shift their focus to the Nedbank Cup last 16 against Acornbush at Kabokweni Stadium in Nelspruit on Sunday.-NEVILLE KHOZA
