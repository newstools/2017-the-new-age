Former world number one Tiger Woods made a satisfying return in his latest comeback after a 10-month layoff punctuated by back surgery and personal problems. Woods fired a three-under-par 69 in the opening round of the Hero World Challenge at Albany Golf Club in the Bahamas. The 41-year-old 14-time major champion carded five birdies and two bogeys in an encouraging first outing since injury forced his withdrawal at the Dubai Desert Classic in February. “I thought I did great,” said Woods, who is three shots back from leader Tommy Fleetwood, who posted a six-under-par 66. “I hadn’t played in a while after some difficulties, so to come out here and score like I did was nice,” Woods added. Woods underwent back surgery in April. AFP
