THE average pay for chief executive officers in the top 10 JSE-listed companies is R24.6m annually, a new PwC report shows. These companies account for 60% of the JSE s market capitalisation. Chief financial officers have an average remuneration of R13.8m while directors average R7.7m.PWC s report reviews the total guaranteed package for executives paid during the reporting period and includes an overview of short-term incentives paid to executives. While shareholders and other stakeholders put pressure on regulators to curb the perceived high levels of executive pay and their incentive arrangements, executives in the corporate sector are also under pressure to adapt to the changing business environment in the face of the digital revolution. Executive pay has come undern intense scrutiny around the world, with many critics arguing for more stringent regulations citing the weak link between pay and performance and the need for more transparency in the pay determination process, PwC Africa s Gerald Seegers said. In South Africa, there is a strong movement, particularly in the wake of the King IV report, pushing for listed companies to adopt better remuneration reporting and shareholder engagement practices, and for all organisations to implement fair and responsible remuneration policies, Seegers said.Executive pay continues to come under intense scrutiny from all angles, with mounting calls from institutional investors to reform executive remuneration.Despite numerous initiatives being undertaken around transparency and better reporting, the gap between executive pay and the pay of the average employee continues to widen. Some countries have sought to regulate executive remuneration for companies falling within specific sectors such as financial services, whereas other elements have addressed all publicly-listed companies.Some jurisdictions place specific requirements on the composition and disclosure of an executive s remuneration package.For example, South Africa and the UK have sought to align the remuneration packages of executives in insurance companies to each company s risk horizon.thelman@thenewage.co.zaThelma Ngoma
