IRAQI forces in west Mosul worked to clear bombs and searched for jihadist fighters in recaptured areas yesterday to set the stage for renewed offensive operations, officers said. Iraqi security forces launched a major operation to retake west Mosul, the Islamic State (Isis) group s last major urban bastion in the country, on February 19, but several days of bad weather slowed their pace until a renewed push began on Sunday. Since then, they have retaken a series of neighbourhoods, the Nineveh provincial government headquarters and the Mosul museum, where Isis militants infamously filmed themselves destroying priceless artefacts. The focus is on clearing the areas that were liberated on Tuesday and defusing bomb-rigged houses, Lt-Col Abdulamir al-Mohammedawi of the elite Rapid Response Division said. The liberation of the city centre is a first and important step for beginning the liberation of the old city, Mohammedawi said, referring to an area near the old city that Iraqi forces have recaptured in recent days. The battle for the old city still lies ahead and may see some of the toughest fighting of the operation to retake west Mosul. Berms and barriers were set up to protect the forces and they began search operations in Al-Dawasa and Al-Danadan and Al-Agaidat areas to find (Isis) remnants to prepare for the completion of offensive operations, LtGen Raed Shakir Jawdat, the federal police commander, said. Jawdat was referring to areas retaken by Rapid Response and federal police forces. Isis overran large areas north and west of Baghdad in 2014, but Iraqi forces backed by US-led air strikes and other support have since retaken much of the territory they lost. Iraqi forces launched the massive operation to retake Mosul on October 17, first recapturing its eastern side before setting their sights on its smaller but more densely populated west. AFP NEAR MOSUL
