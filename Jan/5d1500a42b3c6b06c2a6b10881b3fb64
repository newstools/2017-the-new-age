Proteas opening batsman Stephen Cook says that the team would love to make a clean sweep of in the third Sunfoil Test match against Sri Lanka at at the Bidvest Wanderers Stadium on Thursday . The side leads the series 2-0 and Cook said that the Proteas spoke about the importance of being in the lead and finishing the job. We spoke about it in Australia and didn t do the business after having done the whitewash in the one-day series. It s first and foremost on the guys minds, we know the conditions have suited us and we have been playing some good cricket and when opportunities present themselves to dominate like this that is what we are looking to do,&#8221; Cook said. The Highveld Lions player said that at the Wanderers the wicket generally had a few cracks , especially when it is dry also saying that there ought to be a usual pace and bounce. &#8220;It might be a little bit slow to start the game but generally day two and day three it tends to quicken up, Cook said. The 34 year old said that it was a dream come true to bat at his home ground which will also host Hashim Amla&#8217;s 100th Test match for the Proteas,he urged fans to come out and support the team as it will be last Test match to be played on home soil for the season. This is my second home, I grew up on the banks here and that has been well documented that I have spent my whole career here. To be able to walk out and play a Test match for South Africa here is fantastic. There is no extra pressure, only natural pressure with it being a Test match, There have been many a day here that I have sat here playing in front of empty stands thinking it would be a great place to play in front of a packed house. Hopefully the guys come out and support this Test match and that part of the dream can be fulfilled,&#8221; Cook said.
