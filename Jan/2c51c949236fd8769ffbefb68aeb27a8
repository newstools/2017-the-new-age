The battle continues for Namibians involved in phosphate mining as key players gear up for court in a David and Golaith case to debate the validity of phosphate mining.Namibia Marine Phosphate (NMP) a subsidiary of Omani mining joint venture company Mawarid Mining is set to be developing the world s first marine phosphate project off the coast of Namibia to establish the company as a premier rock phosphate producer.The company has come under fire as many dispute the real impact of the project on the environment and employment in the area.NMP said that the project had the potential to establish future downstream processing of NMP s beneficiated phosphate into higher value phosphorous and compound fertilisers of the resource, particularly for the production of fertiliser. Local production of phosphate will help to secure agricultural productivity and food security in Namibia and the region, as well as elsewhere in the world. The project is set to contribute to national and regional growth through employment, royalties and tax revenues. Direct permanent employment will be created, as well as indirect jobs in supporting services. These will include short-term employment during construction and the opportunity for capacity development and training, NMP said.South Africa and Namibia stand to be the first countries that permit seabed mining if governing bodies allow for the process to occur.The South African coastline stretches as far as the Namibian border on the west coast to the Mozambique border on the east coast.President Jacob Zuma said that South Africa s oceans had the potential to contribute up to R177bn to the country s gross domestic product (GDP), while creating up to 1 million new jobs, by 2033 compared to R54bn generated, and 316000 jobs created, in 2010.The NDP also identified the ocean economy as one of the key drivers to eliminate poverty and reduce inequality in South Africa by 2030.Environmental issuesThe ministry of environment and tourism in Namibia approved the marine phosphate mining application from an Omani mining company which then gave the green light to commence work on the phosphate mining project.Environmental affairs commissioner Teofilus Nghitila wrote a letter approving the company s environmental impact management plans dubbing them sufficient enough to commence with the project .The ministry called on members of the public and interest groups to submit any objections they had to the phosphate project.Fishing groups like the Confederation of Namibian Fishing Associations (CNFA), the Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources were the part of lobby groups against the project.Environmental lobby group Swartkopmund Matters led the pack in discrediting the validity of phosphate mining saying that the project will not only have a direct influence on fishing, but will harm the marine environment in its totality .The Confederation of Namibian Fishing Associations chairperson, Matti Amukwa, told Namibian media that the fishing industry is worth R10bn and if the current generation allows marine phosphate mining to continue we must be able to explain to our children s kids why we allowed the destruction of one of our biggest economic activities .The country s fishing revenue represents a 43% growth increase from the previous financial year that generated N$7bn (R7bn).NMP reports that those groups that are opposing phosphate mining are spreading propaganda to the people of the Walvis Bay area to have them believe that the project will be responsible for killing fish and loss of jobs in the fishing industry .Local businessmen and director of NMP Knowledge Katti said that local residents were being duped into believing that phosphate would have dire consequences on the environment as well their livelihoods when in fact the project is set to create 176 full time jobs in the industry. Many community members were misled by trade unionists and environmental lobbying groups on the impact of phosphate mining. After mounting pressure from environmental lobby groups the Minister of Environment and Tourism Pohamba Shifeta is said to have thrown in the towel on phosphate mining and backtracked on the issuing of clearance certificate for mining licence.He said that his change of heart was related to public interest .Marine biologist and fisheries scientist Dr Martha Uumati was quoted as saying that phosphate mining was a suicide mission as one could only assess impact after five years of mining.NMP commissioned environmental experts and scholars in a consultative process including the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR),the University of Stellenbosch and experts from London to assess the impact of phosphate mining in the presence of an official of the ministry of the environment and tourism, who has since denied being at the meeting. The ministry said they were satisfied with the independent review study giving power to the environmental commissioner and the environmental certificate was issued to us. We are not happy with the ministry setting aside the decision to issue the clearance certificate. It was unconstitutional Katti said.In videos that have surfaced and been shown to The New Age newspaper, the office of the ministry of fisheries is seen to be present at the consultative process meetings and is now caught in a lie after publicly proclaiming that his office was not consulted in the process.Katti said that halting the project had led to a huge tax revenue loss of nearly N$1.4bn that would have been paid to the government in taxes over the years.THELMA NGOMAthelman@thenewage.co.za
