Returning Chelsea striker Diego Costa did not just let his predatory right foot do his talking for him on Sunday. A pair of gesturing hands were just as eloquent as he appeared to be making a point to his critics.The striker who is never far away from controversy shot the Premier League leaders towards a 2-0 win over Hull City on his return to the first team and celebrated his first-half goal with gestures that mimicked gossiping mouths.At least, that seemed to be his considered response to a wave of reports that he had been involved in a row with Chelsea fitness staff and that his head had been turned by a potential big-money move to China.Costa missed last weekend&#8217;s win at Leicester City with what club officials said was a back strain yet his absence was widely interpreted as the latest strain in the often tense relationship between the striker and the club.Costa&#8217;s goal &#8212; on his 100th appearance for Chelsea since joining from Atletico Madrid &#8212; was his 15th in the league so far this season, leaving him joint top scorer along with Arsenal&#8217;s Alexis Sanchez.The strike also underscored the vital role Costa has played in Chelsea&#8217;s dramatic turnaround from last season&#8217;s woeful performances.Then, the Brazilian-born striker hit the headlines for throwing a bib towards former manager Jose Mourinho after he was left on the substitutes bench for a game.Chelsea fans showed they bore no grudge against Costa over his latest absence, chanting his name before kick-off on Sunday.The striker proved central to Chelsea&#8217;s attacking moves throughout the game, latching on to a Victor Moses cross with a sharp finish just before halftime to give the leaders their crucial breakthrough.Chelsea captain Gary Cahill, who wrapped up the win with a late goal, said it was clear that Costa was delighted to be back in the team.&#8220;There was a lot of talk when something happens or he misses one game, and all of a sudden you&#8217;re hearing about all these different stories,&#8221; Cahill told Sky Sports.&#8220;I suppose it gets a bit tiring after a bit and the best way to respond is to produce a goal like that. We are delighted to have him back in the team and we&#8217;re delighted to have him scoring again which he&#8217;s been doing all season.&#8221;Manager Antonio Conte said he hoped Costa&#8217;s performance would finish the speculation about the striker, who has two years left on his contract with Chelsea.&#8220;I repeat, he is very happy to stay with us and he is very happy to play with Chelsea. Now it is very important to be concentrated on the present,&#8221; Conte said. &#8220;The present is more important than the future.&#8221;-Reuters
