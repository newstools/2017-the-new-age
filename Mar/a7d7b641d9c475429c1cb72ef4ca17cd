Premier David Mabuza has vowed to eliminate the triple challenges of poverty, unemployment, and inequality faced by the residents in Louisville and neighbouring areas near Barberton outside Mbombela by creating temporary job opportunities.Louisville is located around the jurisdiction of the Lily Mine which was shut down after its structure collapsed in February last year.The gold mine s disaster saw a group of workers being rescued, except for Solomon Nyarenda, Yvonne Mnisi and Pretty Nkambule who remained trapped.The mine s operations were put on hold due to financial problems and allied issues.Mabuza promised the employment opportunities during a meeting with the residents last week.He said the construction of about 1000 RDP houses and other services would happen in the area until 2019 and about 6000 families who used to work at the mine and nearby places would have benefited as workers during the construction period. We want the people here to live a better life. They should also enjoy the fruits of their freedom. We are of course concerned about the issue of the mine. Our wish is to improve their lives while we attend to the retrieving of the three bodies (Nyarenda, Mnisi and Nkambule). We want the people to be able to have food on the table and shelter that they will call home while we deal with and solve the challenges of Lily Mine. We definitely want the mine to open for operations, but at the same time we are committed to changing the lives of the people, Mabuza said.He further said the provincial government was hard at work in ensuring that the mine resumed its operations. Our main concern is to retrieve the bodies of our loved ones. But that would be possible when the mine is in operation. The bodies of our beloved will be retrieved one day. I am not going to wait for the investors but I will look for other options for the mine to open and find a way to recover the bodies of our beloved. We want to insist that the mine opens, Mabuza said.FRANCE NYAKA
