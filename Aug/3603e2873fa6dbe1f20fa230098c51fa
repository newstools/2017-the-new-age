THE ANC in the Frances Baard region has condemned the attack by some of its members on the regional chairperson, Thapelo Dithebe.The party said Dithebe was assaulted at the weekend while campaigning for the upcoming by-elections in the Magareng local municipality.The regional spokesperson, Ali Diteme, said the attack was cowardice and backward. This attack must be treated as an act of cowardice carried out by people who are immune to democratic outcomes and we see it in serious light and it must be condemned as such, Diteme said.He said apart from being counter-revolutionary in its own form and character, the attack was reductionist, embarrassing and outrightly backward.Diteme said the attack was spearheaded by a small group of people who were purported to be ANC supporters during the community meeting which had to finalise the selection of the candidate for the by-elections. We will immediately commission a team to investigate the matter and bring the perpetrators to book, he said.Diteme said they were going to work hard to regain the ward following the death of the ANC member in the embattled municipality. We also wish to congratulate comrade Nontsisi Mokomela for having emerged as a preferred candidate in a hotly contested position and we are hoping to meet the deadline of the independent electoral commission to register such a candidate in time as such, Diteme said.He said the meeting had to be rerun on three occasions due to disruptions and acts of hooligans which he termed un-ANC.Diteme said they were going to raise matters concerning some provincial executive committee members who were part of disrupting the meeting with the office of the provincial secretary, Deshi Ngxanga. We are calling on all the losing candidates to respect the wishes of the community and work with the branch to produce desirable outcomes to enable the ANC to clinch an anticipated victory so as to retain the ANC in power as the municipality is currently a hung municipality, he said.Meanwhile, the ANC Youth League task team in the Frances Baard region has vowed to go all out to ensure young people participate in the next by-elections in Magareng municipality.Convenor of the regional task team, Sandiseni Sithole, said they wanted young people to participate in the by-elections to ensure the party got an overwhelming majority.The by-elections comes after the death of Kelebogile Landry, who was a councillor in Magareng municipality s Ward 1.Sithole said Landry played a critical role in making sure the party accelerated services to the people. She was a shining beacon of hope, a servant of our people and a dedicated cadre. We have a responsibility to pick up the spear from where she left it and continue the good fight, he said.Sithole said during the registration they were going to go out and canvass in all the wards. We call on all young people to form part of the process by registering in their numbers to ensure a decisive ANC victory at the polls. TIISETSO MANOKOtiisetsom@thenewage.co.za
