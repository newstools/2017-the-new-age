THE Road Accident Fund (RAF) is embarking on a campaign to educate road crash victims about its services and assist them to process their claims directly from the RAF instead of using attorneys. This will happen when the RAF visits Thusong Centre in Marapyane on Saturday. Marapyane is located in the Dr JS Moroka local municipality under the Nkangala district municipality. RAF regional manager Dineo Thabede said the significance of the visit was to bring services and information closer to the people, since the majority of road victims were struggling to lodge their claims with the RAF due to lack of knowledge. Thabede said the RAF branded vehicle had the capability of consulting with at least 70 to 80 clients at any given time. She said services offered would include the direct registering of new claims, consolidation of required compliance documents, general claims queries and reporting of cases of alleged misconduct against unscrupulous personal injury attorneys, including touts who defraud unsuspecting claimants. This MobiRaf visit is one of several RAF community outreach events which are planned for the province. The RAF reaches out to people affected by road accidents through various ways including mall activations, churches, community halls, taxi ranks and schools. Claimants are asked to bring their ID documents to enquire about their claims. People claiming for the first time need to have case numbers, accident reports, vehicle registrations and contact numbers of all parties involved in the accident, Thabede said FRANCE NYAKA
