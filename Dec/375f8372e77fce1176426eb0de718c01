The Honduran government declared a state of emergency late Friday that restricts free movement in an attempt to stop violent demonstrations across the country triggered by claims of presidential election fraud. The decree approved by President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who is seeking re-election despite a constitutional ban on a second term, “restricts the free movement of people for a period of 10 days … between 6:00 pm and 06:00 am the following day,” government coordinator Jorge Ramon Hernandez Alcerro said.
