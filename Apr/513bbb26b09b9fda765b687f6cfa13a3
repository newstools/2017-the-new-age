Gauteng police have warned the public against buying second-hand goods as they may be charged as accomplices on possession of suspected stolen goods or even theft.This warning follows the seizure of more than 10 vehicles by members of the Benoni vehicle identification section suspected to be stolen from a car dealer in Edenvale.Gauteng police spokesperson Col Lungelo Dlamini said police followed up on information and visited a car dealer. While doing a routine inspection, they found the stolen vehicles. Some of these vehicles were stolen in Gauteng and as far as Mpumalanga and included Hyundai and VW model vehicles, Dlamini said.He said further investigations were still being done and the lawful owners of the cars would be informed once the investigation had been concluded as some of the vehicles had been tampered with. Second-hand dealers are required by the law to keep proper records of the goods in their possession. Members of the public who are buying second-hand goods have a right to verify that the goods are not stolen if intending to buy them. Buying stolen goods is a crime, Dlamini said.Crime prevention operations conducted throughout the province are also targeting stolen goods which are taken during the commission of crimes that include business breakins and robberies, housebreakins and theft in general. People who are found in possession of stolen goods will end up behind bars, Dlamini said.To curb this scourge police are calling on dealers in second-hand goods and pawnbrokers to apply for the renewal of their business registration.Therefore, every person who runs a business of dealing in second-hand goods in the country, has to apply to be registered under the provisions of the Second Hand Goods Act, 2009 (Act No 6 of 2009).All secondhand goods dealers who have registered from May last year onwards must note that the five-year registration period will expire and registration to continue doing business in dealing with second-hand goods must be renewed.The Second Hand Goods Act, 2009, came into effect on April 30, 2012 to regulate the business of dealers in second-hand goods and pawn brokering.NONDUMISO ZWANE
