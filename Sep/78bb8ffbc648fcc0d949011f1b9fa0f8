The M1 Grayston Bridge inquiry which was postponed in August last year is set to resume in September.The formal inquiry aims to determine whether there was any contravention of the Occupational Health and Safety Amendment Act and any of its regulations, which led to the collapse of the structure or any part thereof, consequently resulting in the untimely deaths and injuries of the people.The bridge was still under construction when it collapsed on the M1 highway Grayston Drive on October 14 resulting in the death of taxi driver Siyabonga Myeni and businessman Adrian Doodnath.The event will take place at the Pretoria Labour Centre offices, Concillium Building at the corner of Nana Sita and Thabo Sehume. The sitting will start at 9 am.-TNA Reporter &nbsp;
