Dawie Kriel has been found guilty of crimen injuria for defamatory remarks he made against the Hindu community.Kriel, 59, a handyman by profession, caused a storm in October after posting a Facebook message insulting Hindus, who he called devil disciples , for setting off fireworks during the Diwali festival. He also threatened to strangle Indians.He was apparently irritated by the prolonged lighting of fireworks in his neighbourhood, the Bluff.President of the SA Hindu Maha Sabha, Ashwin Trikamjee, said while the organisation did not want to usurp the court s role to determine appropriate sentences, the Hindu community would be happy if the court were to impose a sentence that sent a strong message that racism was unacceptable.Kriel will be back in court on March 27 for sentencing.TNA Reporter
