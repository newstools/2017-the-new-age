The inspection Henri van Breda s luxury home in De Zalze Estate home in Stellenbosch has resulted in an unexpected boost for Henri van Breda case.Henri, 22, is accused of murdering his parents and brother with an axe and leaving his sister critically injured during an attack which took place at the luxury De Zalze Estate on January 27, 2015.Judge Siraj Desai led an inspection in loco to the home on Tuesday.Defense lawyer Piet Botha told the court on Wednesday that it was possible for intruders to break into the property because there were no burglar bars on the window.&#8220;The fence surrounding the property, at the gate to the airfield, someone would be able to scale the wall. Scaling the wall is simple, by someone stepping on a box and hoisting themselves,&#8221; said Botha.Judge Desai questioned whether this would not have been extremely hazardous to climb over fence.However, Botha stated that lawyer Lorinda van Niekerk demonstrated yesterday the different ways to gain access to the 12 Goske Street property.The argument in court is over Van Breda s affidavit in which he set out his version of the events of that tragic night.He said on Monday that a laughing intruder attacked his parents, then his brother.Van Breda says the attacker also tried to stab him with a knife but he managed to disarm him.On Tuesday Desai led an in loco inspection to the scene where Henri s parents (Martin, 54, and Teresa, 55, ) and brother (Rudi Van Breda, 22) were hacked to death. Henri s sister Marli sustained a serious head injury but survived.Looking subdued but unemotional, Van Breda stood close to his legal team as the large entourage gathered outside his home where he claims to have watched an intruder set upon his loved ones, laughing as he cut them down.-TNA Reporter
