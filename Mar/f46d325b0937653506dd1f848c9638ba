AS WE mark Human Rights Month this year, we should not only remember the victims of the Sharpeville Massacre of 1960, which saw 69 innocent black lives brutally taken away and scores of others injured under the apartheid regime.We should also remember many others who suffered the same fate under apartheid elsewhere and innumerable other innocent people who suffered petty crimes under its forces.As Davis James Smith put it: To be a black African in South Africa at the height of apartheid was to negotiate an impossible minefield of petty offences that might land you in jail. Chief among them, of course, were the pass laws. It was a common sight in the city to see a group of African men standing handcuffed together on a street corner, or sitting in a line on the kerb, or being marched through the commuter crowds to jail, having been arrest for pass offences. There is a dire need to fuse a multitude of local tales about the sufferings of apartheid victims into the ground-breaking story of the Sharpeville Massacre.This is particularly germane to this view as the event has enormous symbolic significance here at home and across the globe. Capitalising on this epoch-making moment with a view to highlighting the plight of the multitudes of others who suffered an assortment of human rights violations under apartheid despite possible opposing views from some quarters is crucial.Ironically, equally important, there is a need to research and to chronicle the narratives of white compatriots who were coerced into supporting the apartheid system as successive apartheid governments introduced and developed policy and legislative frameworks in a variety of sectors in order to exercise control over every aspect of people s lives.Remembering them within the context of human rights would not only increase the body of knowledge on a range of human rights abuses and the significance of their contribution to the contemporary South African society.It would also develop into a psychological state of shared affinities, which has the potential of galvanising South Africans of all races to support the measures taken to promote reconciliation as the country intensifies dialogues on consciousness raising about racism and the demystification of white supremacy.Additionally, this initiative would enable the country to approach its history in a more reflective way that would bring about something of a novelty in the way we interpret and celebrate this day.It would bring a new meaning to the significance of this day as it would illustrate that the humiliating pain inflicted on black Africans by the apartheid regime was also painfully shared by some among those it was supposed to benefit.Although this would be a step in the right direction, it is likely to deeply upset political bigots as well peacetime heroes and heroines found among us, who stand to benefit from any incident that is likely to derail the process of nation building to promote self-serving agendas.Taking more practical steps intended to realise the South African dream of a rainbow nation , as coined by the Anglican Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu, is desirable and possible.It is tragic that our country is still today confronted by debilitating incidents of racism, which find expression on social media platforms despite efforts intended to eradicate the scourge of racism.Western Cape Premier Helen Zille s remarks trending on social media platforms stating that colonialism wasn t that bad and headlining news bulletins is a case in point.It is unfortunate that there are some among us who have not yet harnessed the intrinsic good sense of the human spirit that should spur them in the right direction to support the country s nation building plan of action.This view is best articulated by Ivy (1986), in his article entitled Elements of Critical Psychology.He said: Each individual has a priority need for the development and actualisation of his or her potential for individuated functioning in harmony with other members of the community, and has, in potential, the rational capacity to adjudicate those needs and the means of their realisation. Each one of us is under an obligation to embrace and support initiatives that are intended to empower individual members of society to liberate themselves from hegemonic patterns of thought and action.As we contrive to build a non-racial, non-sexist, democratic society free of xenophobia and tribalism in multilingual and multicultural society in keeping with our Constitution.As I often say: my central argument is that the efforts by various stakeholders paying tribute to the memories of various leaders, and of recognising places of historical significance, are a step in the right direction, but they require augmentation by a national process of identifying more lowly positioned members of the society.-Sello Mokoena
