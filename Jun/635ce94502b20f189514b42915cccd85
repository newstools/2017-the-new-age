Eastern Cape songstress Amanda Black has been nominated for the BET Awards in the best international act category.The former Idols SA contestant walked away with two awards at the Metro FM Music Awards in February and recently scored three Samas. Black wrote on her Facebook page last week: Just got nominated for #BestInternationalAct #ViewersChoice for the BET Awards 2017 Ohhh my gaahd. Just made my great day even greater! #Amazulu #AmandaBlack. Black performed in her home town, Port Elizabeth, last month as part of her campaign to get votes for the Samas. I really appreciate the support that I get from my fans. To me they are no longer fans but family. I ve always known that I want to do music and my mum encouraged me to first go to school. Then I went to study music at NMMU. I feel honoured by the love and recognition that I ve received through Amazulu which is my first album, she said.Black said the support from her family is one of the things that keeps her going. Black will compete against Dave from the UK, Jorja Smith also from UK, RayVanny from Tanzania, Changmo from South Korea, Daniel Caesar from Canada, Remi from Australia and Skip Marley from Jamaica. I know a lot of young girls now look up to me and all I can say to them is to believe in their dreams. Stay positive and at all times one must work on one s craft and keep pushing. Nothing is impossible, she said.Amanda, Babes Wodumo, AKA and Nasty C are among the South African nominees at the BET Awards.
