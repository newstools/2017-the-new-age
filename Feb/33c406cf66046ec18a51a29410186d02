The constitutionality of the Financial Intelligence Centre Bill will be challenged in the country s highest court as soon as President Jacob Zuma has signed it into law.This was the prediction made yesterday by economic and political analyst Tshepo Kgadima.He made his pronouncement after Parliament s joint finance standing committee, which had been looking at the bill, after Zuma had referred it to Parliament, passed the legislation yesterday.All that remains now is for the bill to be adopted by Parliament before being sent to Zuma to sign the legislation into law.Kgadima slammed the bill as unconstitutional. He said that the bill violated the Constitution on 16 counts. We are going to court that s for sure. The Constitutional Court is the place where this law can be remedied once and for all. He blamed Zuma s lawyers for asking Parliament to look at the question of warrantless searches instead of all the concerns raised with Zuma.Kgadima s warning of litigation re-echoed a warning sounded last month at public hearings into the bill held by the joint standing committee by Mzwanele Manyi, president of the Progressive Professionals Forum.Despite Manyi and others being concerned about the bill empowering searches without warrants, two eminent senior lawyers Jeremy Gauntlet and Ishmael Semenya, told the standing committee at the hearing that Manyi attended that this was indeed constitutional.Yesterday, the joint standing committee chairperson, Yunus Carrim, told journalists: Although the committee could choose to return the bill as is, we decided to clarify a few things. He said in the amended version of the bill there was now clarity that FIC inspectors would not carry out searches that lead to criminal prosecutions.Carrim said: Warrantless searches can only take place in specific circumstances and we set out the behaviour of inspectors. We also elaborated on the need to observe people s rights to privacy and dignity. He did concede it was worrying that people seemed to think the FIC Bill gave more power to the banks. People are confusing the roles of the banks with that of the FIC, which is a supervisory body, Carim said.He said the public s concerns about the banking sector would be addressed when Parliament hosted public hearings on March 14 about the transformation and deracialisation of the banking sector. This search for transformation does not come from a reckless populism which, will in any case, undermine the interests of the poor, Carrim said.DENNIS CRUYWAGENnews@thenewage.co.za
