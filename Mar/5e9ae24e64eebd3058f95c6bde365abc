President Jacob Zuma has on Tuesday assured South Africans that social grants will be paid come the 1st of April.The President was speaking on the sidelines of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) Leaders Summit hosted in Jakarta, Indonesia.&#8220;There has been some anxiety in the country given what has happened. I have met with the minister of Social Development and her team who briefed me as to what has been happening since the Constitutional Court decision as well as what is happening currently to ensure that on the date set they receive their pay,&#8221; said Zuma&#8220;There is no way the country can fail to pay its pensioners and I would suggest that the country should calm down and wait for the date,&#8221; assured Zuma.President Zuma also spoke out against the alarm that has been created in the country, describing it as unfortunate.&#8220;It is unfortunate that some people are speaking as though the date has come and gone and the Minister has failed. Some are even calling for the dismissal of the Minister because she has failed but the date has not come,&#8221; said Zuma.The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) announced it had a new agreement with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) adding that all social grants will be paid as normal on April 1.Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini on Tuesday attempted to assure South Africans that social grants will be paid during an appearance before Paliament&#8217;s standing committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA).&#8220;We understand that when the 31st of March comes the tender will fall off automatically but the main elements of this have not been discussed. We have only been fighting one element of pension payouts and fighting about the date,&#8221; said Dlamini.&#8220;We can assure South Africans that we will be ready to make payments,&#8221; said Dlamini.Meanwhile on Tuesday President Zuma also appealed to Ministers to refrain from making public statements regarding social grant payments for concern that it would create further anxiety.&#8220;They must work on what we have agreed on and pay people on the date. Talking to the country and answering questions is not helping, in fact it helps to fertilise the situation where people make lots of speculation,&#8221; said Zuma.More than 17 million South Africans, among them 12 million children and 3.2 million elderly people, are fully dependent on social grants.
