South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (SATAWU) will embark on a nationwide strike along other unions in the South African Road Passenger Bargaining Council (SARPBAC).This comes after the SATAUWU was granted a certificate allowing them to go on a national bus strike. The five unions were logged on mediation process supervised by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) from Monday until Thursady.SATAWU spokesperson Zanele Sabela said despite them being engaged with employers for four days, which did not bear fruitful results. There is, however, a mandatory 30-day cooling off period unions have to observe before embarking on the strike. Parties can engage during this period if they choose but they are not obliged to, Sabela added.She revealed that negations started late January but they reached a deadlock in the second phase of last month, adding that, it was then parties decided to use CCMA as mediator. Meanwhile, Satawu accused employers of refusing to move despite labour s willingness to compromise. In fact, it would appear employers are hell-bent on having a strike as they refused to make significant shifts and even revoked offers they had made during the second phase of negotiations. Labour, on the other hand, showed good faith by dropping 10 or so items from the original demands list.And although employers were aware that labour only had a mandate to negotiate a one year agreement, they revoked the offer they had previously put on the table and replaced it with a three year 7% across-the-board (ATB) year-on-year offer, the statement read.However, the employer s spokesperson meko Magida said unions had 40 demands and that their initial demands was 30%. He further said the unions needed a minimum of R12 500 per month. We have an existing collective agreement that we signed in 2015 and that agreement expires on 31 of March this year. This agreement was negotiated by Satawu and other unions, but we didn t have Numsa then, now the union s wants to nullify the initial agreement, Magida added.The employer further said that Labour demanded 15% with one year agreement, and that they were offering 7% and a three year agreement.It is reported that employers in the Road Passenger refused to entertain the minimum wage of R8 000 per month, but they instead insisted that the current R5 575 be increased by the ATB.Satawu said it will survey its members across the country to seek a mandate for the mother of all strikes.-Sipho Jack
