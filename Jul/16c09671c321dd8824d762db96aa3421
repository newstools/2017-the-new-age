The Proteas will face one of their toughest tests in the ICC Women s World Cup when they meet host England at the Bristol cricket ground today. The South Africans are unbeaten in this competition following two victories against Pakistan and West Indies while the other match against New Zealand was called off due to rain.They were impressive against West Indies after they restricted them to 48 targets in their last match en route to winning by 10 wickets. They will face a tough England, one of the favourites to win the World Cup. But coach Hilton Moreeng is not daunted by facing the hosts who won two of their three matches. We know what we are good at and we know what we can do, Moreeng said. Our focus is what we do best and I think as far as the conditions are a concern, we have assessed what needs to happen and we used yesterday s practice to pick up what we can. England s batting unit is among the strongest in the competition with Sarah Taylor, Natalie Sciver and Fran Wilson forming a formidable middle-order.But South Africa have an impressive new-ball attack of Shabnim Ismail and Marizanne Kapp and will rely on them to make the breakthroughs. We know England are a good team. But at the moment the squad are in a good space, Moreeng said. The team are heading in the right direction and we are taking ut one step at a time. Every game that we play we approach as a final as there is no easy game at the World Cup. We need to make sure we pitch on the day and win the match. The Proteas came into the World Cup as underdogs but followed with two victories. If we can play as a unit like the players have been doing I don t see us struggling, Moreeng said. The players have been playing for each other. We feel we have a very fit squad and we can push England all the way. The top four top teams will qualify for the semifinals and South Africa, England and New Zealand are in the chasing pack behind Australia and India.-NEVILLE KHOZA|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
