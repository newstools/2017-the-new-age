If you want to buy one of the coolest classic cars of all time and you&#8217;ve got a few suitcases full of cash to pay for it, the opportunity is presenting itself in August at this year&#8217;s Gooding &amp; Company Pebble Beach auction in California. The car in question is the 1970 Porsche 917 that was used in the movie &#8220;Le Mans,&#8221; which starred none other than the legendary Steve McQueen.McQueen played the part of a Porsche factory racing driver who fought off the challenge from Ferrari to claim victory in the world-famous endurance race. This will actually be the second time this particularly special car has been offered for sale through Gooding &amp; Company, although it appeared not to sell the last time in 2014.Despite the car appearing in the film, it wasn&#8217;t actually driven by McQueen personally. But as well as appearing in the film, the 917 was also used as a camera car to capture some shots &#8212; as to keep up with the racing required something equally as fast. According to the auctioneers, the Porsche was also used as a test car for the 1970 running of the 24 Hours of Le Mans.After the Le Mans testing in 1970 the car was sold to Jo Stiffert, who was a real Porsche factory driver who then went on to lease it to McQueen&#8217;s film company a year later. After Stiffert passed away, the auction company says the car disappeared for a long time until it was eventually discovered in a French warehouse in 2001. Gooding &amp; Company have said the car has been thoroughly restored this year for the auction.The auction will take place at Gooding &amp; Company&#8217;s Pebble Beach event during this year&#8217;s concours, which is being held on Sunday, August 20. As for the price; don&#8217;t expect it to be sold for any less than somewhere in the region of the $13 million to $16 million range.-Relaxnews
