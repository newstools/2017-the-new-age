The Free State will this month be the third province to be treated to some of the best wines in the country, brought to it by an action group from the Western Cape, consisting of 13 black-owned brands and a BEE company in the wine industry.Following the resounding success of the launch of the Treasure Chest Wines (TCW) in both Kwazulu-Natal and Gauteng, the next launch will be held at the end of this month at the President Hotel in Bloemfontein.Brand publicity director Louise Hunt said TCW is a proudly South Africanendorsed wine, which will introduce retailers, wine buyers, the hospitality industry and the wine-loving public to the best of the country s most exciting black-owned wine brands. By showcasing a collection of some of the finest wines this country has to offer, not only does Chest aim to give the trade and public an opportunity to engage their world-class varietals but, on a higher level, seeks to spearhead transformation within the wine industry, addressing the importance of supporting local, black-owned wine brands, Hunt said.She said this group of self-made winepreneurs collectively possess over 125 years experience, 12 of whom are visionary women. Pathfinders to transformation in this 360-year-old wine agricultural sector, where less than 2% of the industry is black-owned, the Treasure Chest collective is certainly a force to be reckoned with. Their perseverance, determination and strong desire to work collectively to penetrate the untransformed wine industry and be more active in the retail mainstream of the economy is a prime example for entrepreneurs who are struggling to enter other industries in the country, Hunt said. She said TCW are world-class by any standard, having been the country s first wine served on American Airways, on shelves of leading retailers, and are winners of numerous international awards and are now exporting collectively to over 25 countries. Aimed primarily at trade, wine buyers, retail, hospitality and tourism industries, the wine-loving public and all wine enthusiasts are also invited to attend this historic exclusive event, Hunt said.Malcolm Green, owner of La RicMal wines, says the Treasure Chest road show is the first event in the country that will address growth, transformation and asset ownership to black-owned brands in the wine industry of South Africa.He said this initiative was long overdue and needs urgent partnership from all spheres of the South African economy. Wine brand owners will contribute significantly to the agricultural industry s growth, economic development and job creation, introducing and creating a new wine experience for the untapped market, Green said.
