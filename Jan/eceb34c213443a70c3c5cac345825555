The South African Premier Soccer League (PSL) has released an amended fixture list to include the fixtures that had either been postponed or abandoned in the first half of the season.The change is due to the Olympics, the African cup of Nations and the impact that the achievements of Mamelodi Sundowns had on the programme. The amended fixtures list also accommodates the four teams representing the country in the Caf Champions League and Caf confederations Cup.&#8220;Unfortunately the League has had to make provision for the possible need for further amendments in the month of April/May 2017. The nature of these changes (if any) will, to a large extent, be determined by how our four clubs participating in CAF competitions perform in the initial stages of their respective competitions,&#8221; the statement read.The league has also, after consent from SAFA with a view to address outstanding matches, scheduled the first Absa Premiership fixture in 2017 for Friday the 3rd of February.Friday 03 February 2017Bidvest Wits v Orlando Pirates Ellis Park 20:00Tuesday 07 February 2017Kaizer Chiefs v Free State Stars FNB Stadium 19:30Bidvest Wits v Ajax Cape Town Bidvest Stadium 19:30Cape Town City FC v Highlands Park Cape Town Stadium 19:30Wednesday 08 February 2017SuperSport United v Golden Arrows Lucas Moripe Stadium 19:30Polokwane City v Maritzburg United Peter Mokaba Stadium 19:30Platinum Stars v Orlando Pirates Royal Bafokeng Stadium 19:30Bloemfontein Celtic v Mamelodi Sundowns Dr Molemela Stadium 19:30Chippa United v Baroka FC Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium 19:30Saturday 11 February 2017Golden Arrows v Bloemfontein Celtic Chatsworth Stadium 15:30Ajax Cape Town v Cape Town City FC Cape Town Stadium 20:15Maritzburg United v Kaizer Chiefs Harry Gwala Stadium 20:15Sunday 12 February 2017Highlands Park v Polokwane City Makhulong Stadium 15:30Tuesday 14 February 2017Chippa United v Mamelodi Sundowns Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium 15:00Wednesday 15 February 2017Orlando Pirates v Bidvest Wits Orlando Stadium 19:30Free State Stars v SuperSport United Goble Park 19:30Baroka FC v Platinum Stars Peter Mokaba Stadium 19:30Saturday 18 February 2017Polokwane City v Ajax Cape Town Peter Mokaba Stadium 15:30Golden Arrows v Free State Stars Chatsworth Stadium 15:30Kaizer Chiefs v Highlands Park FNB Stadium 18:00Cape Town City FC v Orlando Pirates Cape Town Stadium 20:15SuperSport United v Maritzburg United Lucas Moripe Stadium 20:15Platinum Stars v Mamelodi Sundowns Royal Bafokeng Stadium 20:15Sunday 19 February 2017Bloemfontein Celtic v Chippa United Dr Molemela Stadium 15:30Bidvest Wits v Baroka FC Bidvest Stadium 15:30Tuesday 21 February 2017Highlands Park v SuperSport United Makhulong Stadium 19:30Wednesday 22 February 2017Mamelodi Sundowns v Bidvest Wits Lucas Moripe Stadium 19:30Bloemfontein Celtic v Platinum Stars Dr Molemela Stadium 19:30Saturday 25 February 2017Orlando Pirates v Polokwane City Orlando Stadium 15:30Chippa United v Golden Arrows Buffalo City Stadium 18:00Mamelodi Sundowns v Platinum Stars Loftus Versfeld Stadium 19:30Ajax Cape Town v Kaizer Chiefs Cape Town Stadium 20:15Sunday 26 February 2017Maritzburg United v Free State Stars Harry Gwala Stadium 15:30Baroka FC v Cape Town City FC Peter Mokaba Stadium 15:30Tuesday 28 February 2017 Mamelodi Sundowns v Chippa United Lucas Moripe Stadium 19:30 -Lehlogonolo Mashigo
