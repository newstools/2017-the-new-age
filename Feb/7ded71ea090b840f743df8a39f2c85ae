Nissan has hit upon a bright idea for taking the connected car mainstream: offer it as a retrofit option.All of the ultimate benefits that will come when the autonomous vehicles arrive can&#8217;t come to fruition until most cars on the road are of the connected variety.Only when cars can communicate with each other, and access the internet and cloud servers while on the go, will they start to avoid creating congestion, pause at junctions automatically because another car is coming, and activate the traction control because the vehicle ahead is slipping on the ice.And in terms of these levels of connected features, only marques such as Mercedes and Volvo are offering them as standard equipment on current generation cars.Nissan is hoping to change that by offering what it describes as &#8220;connectivity for all customers&#8221; and is about to start stocking connected devices at dealerships in Japan and India while at the same time creating an affordable tariff of connected services for customers in other countries who own Nissans that weren&#8217;t sold as connected cars.&#8220;Nissan Europe has a comprehensive long-term vision to develop more advanced technologies and services that offer our customers greater choice and personalisation than ever before, building on our existing investments in this space,&#8221; said Vincent Wijnen,Nissan Europe&#8217;s Vice President for After Sales, Customer Quality and Training.Nissan&#8217;s devices will offer simple connected car services such as advanced warning when maintenance or servicing is required, live traffic updates and route re-planning, stolen vehicle tracking and breakdown assistance.However, it also wants to use the data to help shape the next generation of Nissan cars and their range of customizable features.&#8220;We are committed to evolving and transforming car design and manufacturing, by offering a new level of sophistication and customisation in line with the lifestyles and aspirations of today&#8217;s customers. The ultimate goal is hyper-personalisation and greater control,&#8221; Wijnen said.-Relaxnews
