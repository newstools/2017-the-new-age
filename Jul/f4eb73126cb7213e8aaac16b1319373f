FORMER Orlando Pirates striker Phumudzmo Manenzhe has joined Bidvest Wits goalkeeper Moeneeb Josephs in blasting Bucs players. Josephs last month labelled Pirates players as Instagram players following the lack of commitment they showed this past season where they finished only 11th on the Absa Premiership log.They also failed to win any trophies on offer and were thumped 4-1 recently by SuperSport United in the Nedbank Cup final. Having watched his former team sinking Manenzhe feels the players are not playing for the club badge but only for themselves. Chairman Irvin Khoza always says when you are brought into the team, you come to make your own history, Manenzhe said during the Carling Black Label Champion Cup media briefing yesterday. And I think the players are making the wrong history. Having not qualified for the top eight was not ever done before at this club. Against SuperSport, they lost without dignity. The supporters want to see some heart, see that you are really trying. I really didn t see that hunger in the final or in the commitment from the players. While I was still there, we lost games but when you got into the change room, the management and the technical team would say unlucky today , but in Durban, I don t think that was said. Manenzhe said a change of attitude would turn things around. I had one of the best brand managers while I was still playing for the club in the late Zodwa Khoza. What she always said was to represent the badge, Manenzhe said. She used to say to us, you represent the badge first, the supporters and then your name and your family at the back of your jersey . I feel the players at the moment they are playing for their name at the back of the jersey first. They must play for the club and the supporters first. A total of 20000 tickets are still available for the Black Label Carling Cup match between Pirates and Chiefs on July 29 at FNB Stadium.nevillek@thenewage.co.za-Neville Khoza
