The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) has condemned the South African Police Service management for &#8216;unfair labour practice&#8217;.This comes after the union called on the SAPS to ensure that all 10111 workers are remunerated fairly, as they were all doing the same job. The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) calls on the South African Police Service management to ensure that the 10111 workers are remunerated fairly.At least 5000 call centre workers went on strike this week because the S-A-P-S violates the principle of equal pay for work of equal value, Numsa said in a statement.Numsa&#8217;s call comes amid reports that police have made alternative plans to deal with events of a strike by workers at the centre.Numsa said workers at the 10111 call centre did not earn the same as other workers in government institutions who do the same kind of work. NUMSA condemns this kind of unfair labour practice. This is precisely the kind of principle that employers in the Engineering sector wish to impose on our members, which is why we are now on the verge of a nationwide strike, the union reiterated.Numsa added that the current government cannot claim to be promoting radical economic transformation while state institutions were guilty of exploiting workers in the same way that greedy capitalists exploit workers every day. Police management is putting the lives of millions of South Africans at risk by exploiting SAPU members and forcing them to strike, the union said.-TNA Reporter
