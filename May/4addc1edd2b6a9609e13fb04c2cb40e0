Nothing for us without us.These were the emphatic words of young people as they launched Youth Month in Bloemfontein yesterday.Young people said they wanted streamlined development offices that had a budget and a proper plan on how they would address youth development challenges.Young people said from now on they would be at the centre stage of all decisions made about young people in the province.Gone is the era where the youth was told what it had to do.The appointment of a youth advisor in the premier s office, Tswelopele Manabile, has also given confidence to many young people who said finally there would be direct access to the premier through this office.Manabile together with the Free State Premier Ace Magashule, and other young people, launched the month yesterday during The New Age Business Briefing.They both said it was important to focus energy and resources on the youth and especially those with disabilities because they had somehow been left out of the periphery of development.Manabile said her appointment as a youth advisor was not just another appointment. We want these youth coordinators to be centred in one office and speak with one voice, she said. We want them to have a budget allocation so that they are able to do the work they were appointed to do. We have taken this challenge to focus on the youth because Africa has the youngest population of all continents, Magashule said. This means the future is in their hands, plus the youth have been very vocal about youth matters. Also on the panel was Tebogo Radebe, who is living with albinism.Radebe encouraged young people with disabilities to get involved in their communities and occupy the space that is rightfully theirs.Nyalleng Potlane, who is blind, said her inability to see did not mean that she did not have a vision about her life. She is also a manager in the department of the premier. I can cook, clean, wash and I lead people who have sight, Potlane said. So my visual impairment has not limited my ability to do what I want to do.
