Jeremy Cronin has called on President Jacob Zuma to step down and has also accused a narrow Africanist agenda of creeping into the ANC. Zuma must step down, he said in Cape Town, as he also called on all South Africans to recognise the danger the country was in and to unite in defence of the Constitution.He said the government must immediately cut ties with the Guptas.He also expressed his doubts as to whether speaker Baleka Mbete would allow a secret ballot on August 8 when Parliament was due to vote on a motion of no confidence in President Zuma.Speaking at a Cape Town Press Club lunch yesterday, the SACP deputy secretary-general also called for those ministers named in former public protector Thuli Madonsela s state capture report to be investigated.Cronin also stated his support for a Judicial Commission of Inquiry, as recommended by Madonsela, but stressed that such an inquiry should not be a whitewash as the Seriti Commission of Inquiry into the arms deal had been.Of the political situation in South Africa, Cronin said although there was Zanufication, the country had not reached a situation similar to that of Zimbabwe.Worrisome trends that were emerging in South Africa, Cronin said, was a new model of black empowerment, one of which was to milk parastatals.There was also the emergence of a shadow parallel state, a phenomenon that the SACP labelled a silent coup.Recalling President Zuma s words about wanting to be a dictator for six months, Cronin said he was also worried about growing authoritarianism in the country.He said South Africa had a powerful media, capitalist sectors with which he did not always agree, trade unions, a civil society and a faith-based sector.But he said: we are living in a world where populism or demagoguery is rising to the fore .In South Africa, the state capture agenda was deeply demagogic. Those involved are a well organised group.Other features included a return to PAC politics. It s a narrow Africanist agenda. It was also anti-intellectual, including a resort to all kinds of snake oil cures.All of this was not sufficient to disguise the heavy Gupta capture of key parts of the state and the ANC, he said.Of the no confidence debate, Cronin said it would not be a secret ballot because that was not what the ANC leadership wanted.Should Mbete rule against an open ballot, he said, the opposition parties would take this decision review to the courts, thus there was a possibility that no voting or debating would take place in August.He declined to say how he would vote though.-DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
