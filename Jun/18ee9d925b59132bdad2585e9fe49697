South African education experts and stakeholders and not colonial powers have crafted the country s education policy, which reflect the values of the Constitution.In addition, a number of scientific laws, such as Newton s Law and its applications, are part of the physical sciences curriculum. Scientific laws and applications thereof will remain part of any future curriculum as they provide foundational knowledge in science. This was part of an answer Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga gave in response to a parliamentary question.She was asked by DA member of Parliament James Vos whether her department had made any attempt to settle on a working definition of decolonisation as it pertained to the school curriculum.Motshekga replied: The Department of Basic Education has not formulated a definition of the term decolonisation , nor has it settled on a working definition of it as it pertains to the school curriculum. The reason for this was that decolonisation as a concept or term was not mentioned in the Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement. The policy was based on principles such as social transformation, human rights, inclusivity, environmental and social justice and valuing indigenous knowledge systems. Decolonisation of the curriculum is a process and not an event, as the development, review, assessment and strengthening of the curriculum in itself cannot be a once-off event. South Africa has developed and reviewed several school curricula since 1998. Part of this policy included steps to be taken to ensure that pupils were fully immersed in the indigenous knowledge systems through expos and site visits.It would also include the participation of indigenous knowledge holders in local communities to link indigenous knowledge and school knowledge and the integration of indigenous knowledge in social cohesion programmes. Scientific laws and applications will also remain part of any future curriculum as they provide foundational knowledge in science. DENNIS CRUYWAGENdennisc@thenewage.co.za
