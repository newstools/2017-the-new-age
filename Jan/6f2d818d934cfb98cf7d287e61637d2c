Several good second-nine recoveries saw world number two Rory McIlroy fire a first-round 67 in the South African Open Thursday to trail early leader Trevor Fisher junior by one shot.Experimenting with clubs from three manufacturers after previous supplier Nike withdrew from the market, the Irishman struggled off the tee as his round drew to a close.Wayward drives found the rough on his final three holes at Glendower Golf Club in the eastern outskirts of Johannesburg, but McIlroy showed his class with superb recovery shots.He scrambled pars at seven and nine &#8212; the Irishman played the back nine first &#8212; and birdied eight for a five-under round and a satisfactory seasonal debut.When the four-time major winner last changed clubs, to sign a multimillion-dollar deal with Nike four years ago, he initially battled to adapt.&#8220;I was a bit adventurous on my second nine,&#8221; admitted the 27-year-old, who hopes to replace Australian Jason Day at the top of ranking by the end of January.&#8220;As my round drew to a close, I had to scramble on a few holes and did my bit by salvaging some pars.&#8220;I played well, giving myself birdie chances,&#8221; he said after a round watched by a large, appreciative gallery in hot, partly cloudy conditions.McIlroy expressed satisfaction with his new clubs after a seven-birdie, two-bogey round over a 6,942-metre (7,100-yard) parkland course packed with water hazards.&#8220;It is nice to card a 67 in my first competitive round with new clubs. I am sure I will become accustomed to them. There will be some chopping and changing as time goes by.&#8221;After four pars from 10, the relaxed Irishman collected four consecutive birdies before completing his first nine with another par.His second nine had a rollercoaster feel as he picked up another birdie and bogeyed two straight par-fours before making two more birdies.South African Fisher &#8212; 442 places below McIlroy in the world rankings &#8212; owed his clubhouse lead on 66 to a purple eight-hole patch that delivered seven birdies.The lone slip by the recently off-form 37-year-old was a bogey five on 11 at a club hosting the second oldest national golf championship after the British Open for the third year in a row.Sharing second place with McIlroy were South Africans Thomas Aiken and Dean Burmester, who eagled the par-five 15th.The world number two was among five former major winners competing and fellow Irishman Darren Clarke carded a 70 and South African Ernie Els a 74.Nick Faldo of England, competing aged 59, and Retief Goosen of South Africa were among the later starters.Defending champion Brandon Stone of South Africa returned a disappointing four-bogey 74 having carded a practice-round 61 over the same course three days ago.-AFP
