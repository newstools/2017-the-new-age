The North Gauteng High Court has refused the Black Sash Trust leave to appeal in a matter that the organisation sought to prevent Net1 to deduct money from the accounts of social grant beneficiaries.Black Sash sought to intervene in the application to ensure beneficiaries were protected, and to maintain the integrity of the social assistance system. We asked the court, if it found in favour of Net1 on their interpretation of the regulations, to order that the Minister issue new regulations which protect grant beneficiaries, the trust argued.In May, the court ruled against the order by the Department of Social Development and South Africa Social Security Agency (Sassa) to stop Net1 from allowing deductions from accounts of grant beneficiaries.The court also denied Black Sash to be part of the proceedings.The trust said it was disappointed by the Gauteng Hight Court&#8217;s ruling. We are disappointed by today s outcome, especially given the Constitutional Court s March decision which recognised that grant beneficiaries accounts do require special protection, national director of the Black Sash Trust Lynette Maart said. We remain committed to protecting grant beneficiaries from exploitation and unlawful deductions from their social grants, Maart said.The court also found that there was no distinction between social grant beneficiaries accounts held at Grindrod Bank and any other bank account held at another bank, adding that the regulations did not operate to restrict beneficiaries in the operation of their bank account.-TNA Reporter
