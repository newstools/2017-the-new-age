The South African Music Rights Organisation (Samro) has denied being owed R400m by the SABC as well as allegations that the two parties had taken their copyright war to the copyright tribunal as indicated by recent media reports. We are not taking each other to the copyright tribunal and the SABC does not owe us R400m, Samro s Tiyani Maluleke told The New Age yesterday. In previous years, the SABC has consistently paid Samro a tariff for its radio airplay and we haven t had a problem as far as that is concerned. We are always in negotiations with the public broadcaster for the television tariffs, she further said.-Siyabonga Sithole
