African National Congress(ANC) Chief Whip on Thursday said the party must make use of its political power to transform the economy in favour of all people of South Africa, particularly black people.Speaking ahead of the State of the Nation Address(SONA), Mthembu said strong emphasis needs to be placed on radical transformation. As we know, even in the JSE, less than 3% of ownership is accounted for black directors, in a country that has 50 million people who are black, you only have 3% ownership that is accounted for black people? That can&#8217;t be correct, Mthembu said.The ANC Chief Whip said they will be listening attentively to &#8220;what plans our government, through our President, put on the table to fundamentally change this economic equation.&#8221;President Jacob Zuma is set to deliver the State of the Nation Address(SONA) on Thursday night at 7pm.About 441 soldiers will be on duty in the streets of Cape Town around Parliament to help keep law and order.They were called in by Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula on Sunday, in response to a request from the police and will be on duty until Friday. Zuma approved Mapisa-Nqakula s request.Addressing uproar surrounding the deployment, National Asembly speaker Baleka Mbete on Thursday morning said when the President deploys SANDF, whether locally or in other African countries, he has the constitutional obligation to inform Parliament. They are simply being allowed to be ready in case they are needed, to support the police. And even then, only when police indicate that they are not coping, Mbete said.TNA Reporter
