Inreased participation by black owned suppliers in the country s automotive sector and greater use of local components will come under the spotlight during the National Association of Automotive Component and Allied Manufacturers (Naacam) Show to be held in Durban in April. Besides an exhibition focus of bringing in and highlighting black supplier companies, there are two conference sessions, dedicated to black supplier development and transformation, which would reflect on industry s commitment while also showcasing existing success stories. Stakeholders will gather to engage on these and other pertinent issues relevant to this crucial South African manufacturing sector, Renai Moothilal, Naacam executive director said. He said there were opportunities to drive transformation and possibilities to develop a cache of black industrialists, reshaping the owner dynamics within this sector. The entire sector is committed to transformation objectives and is taking proactive steps to foster and accelerate this development. Given the levels of government support for the automotive industry through the current automotive Production and Development Programme (APDP), and other supporting instruments such as the Black Industrialists Scheme, it is accepted that government will continue to push the sector towards an ownership profile that matches demographic representation, Moothilal said.The mainstream automotive economy, represented by an estimated 400 executive level delegates, including black-owned manufacturers and stakeholders will gather to engage on these and other pertinent issues relevant to this crucial South African manufacturing sector.Moothilal believes the show would be a great platform for the sector to showcase its true capability . We must deepen our value chains and take control of the sector, he said.-TNA Reporter|business@thenewage.co.za
