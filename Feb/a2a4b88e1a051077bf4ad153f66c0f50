The Black First Land First movement (BLF) will on Saturday launch their counter Anti-Racism Bill at the Devonshire Hotel in Braamfontein .&nbsp; Black First Land First &#8216;s national spokesperson Lindsay Maraasdorp said that the movement aims to correctly identify what is racism. &#8220;We put forward a counter Anti-Racism Bill so that we can correctly identify what is racism for example black cant be resist ,understanding which organizations should be banned , example the AfriForum and so forth,&#8221; . Maraasdorp said .Maraasdorp said the bill is to identify amongst other issues the punishment of people who are found to be guilty of a racism crime.&#8220;So its a counter bill to the current one that is currently proposed in parliament , because the current one does not take into consideration that white people came into south Africa , stole this land . Reduced and destroyed our ways of living , example religion and culture ,&#8221; Maraasdorp said Maraasdorp said that the current bill in parliament does not acknowledge the fact that racism is based on the power to subjugate and that the only people who have the power in this country are white people and that the black majority including coloureds and Indians are subjugated under that power .He said that racism is not only a personal experience but more so an institutional or societal experience .However the BLF says that their counter bill is going to address the primary condition that blacks cannot be resist and also articulate why blacks cannot be racist in terms of land disposition and so forth .The BLF said that they are launching the bill so that all society can know about it , and they are making a submission to parliament . They will also do public engagement to inform people on what this Anti-Racism Bill is and what racism is . Furthermore BLF outlined that they want the bill to be passed , but while the parliament is still engaging on it they will continue to do the work of government .The Anti-Racism Bill of 2017 of BLF will be unveiled on Saturday by Blacks In Dialogue (BID) .The Panellists will be , Athi Mongezeleli Joja the co-author (New Frank Talk Editorial Collective) , Ndumiso Dladla (Teacher, author, founding member of the Azanian Philosophical Society) and the BLF national Convener , Andile Mngxitama .-TNA Reporter &nbsp;
