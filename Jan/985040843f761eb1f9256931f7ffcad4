Shell Gabon&#8217;s 400 staff have returned to work, ending an 11-day walkout after a deal was reached with management over the planned sale of the business, union sources said Monday.&#8220;Work has resumed at all sites operated by Shell Gabon,&#8221; after the government helped mediate a deal regarding workers&#8217; compensation, said the ONEP union which had originally organised the open-ended strike.Royal Dutch Shell, one of the two historic operators alongside French group Total, is selling its Gabon oil assets.The planned sale, worth an estimated $700 million, is part of a drive by Shell to spin off a total of $30 billion worth of assets to cut debt.But the sale plans have worried the workforce, with the union saying Shell&#8217;s withdrawal from Gabon was detrimental to staff and they should be paid damages.Shell is expected to sign a deal to sell the Gabon operations to US fund Carlyle this month, a source close to the talks said last week.&#8220;We don&#8217;t comment on market rumours and we have nothing to add on this occasion,&#8221; the group said.French group Perenco, present in Gabon since 1960, was also in the running to buy the Shell assets.The 400 staff are expected to be retained by the company&#8217;s new owners.Last week, the union said that the ongoing strike had led to production cuts of up to 50 percent, with lost output worth some $4.5 million.-AFP
