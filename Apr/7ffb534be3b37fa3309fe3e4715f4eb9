Eskom responded yesterday to the National Treasury s allegations regarding the coal contracts and prepayments made to Tegeta Exploration and Resources, saying certain conclusions in the Treasury compliance report are patently wrong .Eskom complained that the Treasury didn t seek a meeting with them for clarity on the information provided, yet went ahead and made the report available to the auditor-general and the parliamentary standing committee on public accounts (Scopa), despite an undertaking from then minister Pravin Gordhan that it would not do so. The Treasury s assertion that Eskom overpaid for coal demonstrates a lack of understanding and appreciation of coal supply agreements, Eskom said. The Treasury did not have enough information and documents to draw conclusions and released the draft report even though Eskom was still collating information that had been requested. Eskom said the Treasury was reckless and betrayed its lack of understanding when it referred to a coal purchase from Tegeta as fruitless and wasteful .Furthermore, the Treasury completely overlooked instances when the actual price Eskom paid for Tegeta coal was lower than the base price.In the Treasury s opinion that the R659m Eskom paid as an advance to Tegeta should be treated as a loan as the money was not used for capacity augmentation , Eskom said the argument was pure nonsense as prepayments were specifically made to mitigate blackout risks in the event of Eskom running out of coal.The advance was indeed used to open new drag lines, Eskom said, which helped increase production of coal in line with Eskom s requirements.Eskom denied ever having paid for reject coal from Tegeta, as claimed. This claim is baseless since tests were conducted and the Treasury was notified of this. It is only when a stockpile is approved by Eskom that the dispatch begins from the approved stockpile, Eskom said.-TNA REPORTER
