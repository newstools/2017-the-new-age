Western Sydney Wanderers ended Sydney FC&#8217;s unbeaten 19-game run with a spirited 1-0 win in a tempestuous A-League Sydney derby on Saturday.Brendon Santalab&#8217;s goal in the 26th minute proved the winner to give Wanderers their first derby win in three years before 45,000 fans at Sydney&#8217;s Olympic stadium.Santalab turned sharply inside the Sydney goal area to fire home from close range.But Sydney had strong claims for a penalty in stoppage time when defender Robbie Cornthwaite hung out a leg to bring down Sydney skipper Alex Brosque inside the box.The victory was a perfect tonic for Wanderers, who have struggled in this season&#8217;s A-League ahead of Tuesday&#8217;s AFC Champions League opener at home with Japan&#8217;s Urawa Red Diamonds.-AFP &nbsp;
