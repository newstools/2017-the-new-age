Bongekile Simelane, known as Babes Wodumo, is livid that she walked away empty-handed at the South African Music Awards ceremony held at the Sun City Superbowl on Saturday.Wodumo, who released the popular song Wololo, said the awards were unfair for not crowning her for any of the categories she was nominated in, namely: best newcomer, best female, best album and song of the year.In a video that has gone viral on Twitter, she lashed out and claimed that big corporates were buying awards, that is why she has not won anything. It is clear that awards in South Africa are being bought. There is no way that my song can trend the whole year and even scoop a BET nomination but fail to win an award here at home, she said.She&#8217;s really hurt #BabesWodumo #SAMA23 pic.twitter.com/UQXcaNs5Ji uNhlaka (@Mbovu_KN) May 27, 2017Supported by her partner Big Nuz s Mampintsha, who cussed the Samas and corporates, calling them rubbish. F**k all of this, all you big companies who come and buy awards are jealous of Babes and West Ink, he lashed out. The artist said how could the music awards board decide against Wololo for a song that even white kids were singing.#SAMA23 Mampintsha doing the most for #babeswodumo. The level of unprofessionalism though. pic.twitter.com/S9DDJl1Ev7 #StopAnimalAbuse (@fkay_b) May 27, 2017Social media was divided by Babes award-less night. Her fans said she was deserving, even music mogul Black Coffee said she at least deserved to be crowned Best Newcomer. However, others said she should stop feeling entitled to awards and continue working hard until her time comes.news@thenewage.co.za
