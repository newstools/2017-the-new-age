Despite a shortage of marigolds, the colourful Maduraiveeran prayer festival went ahead successfully at the Shri Mariammen Temple in Mount Edgecombe near Durban at the weekend.The centuries-old thanks giving eventsaw thousands of devotees and visitors paying homage to Mother Mariammen and Lord Maduraiveeran, with sacrificial offerings to signify their absolute faith, trust and love for the Hindu goddess.Observed annually from mid-July to mid-August, the festival uses a lot of marigolds and syringa leaves because of their traditional decorative and medicinal value, a belief believed to have originated in south India.However, there s been a short supply of marigolds and syringa leaves this year so followers were requested to rally around and help the temple source the symbolic leaves and flowers. As this is a difficult period for marigolds and syringa leaves, the Shri Mariammen Temple Society made an appeal to devotees to assist by bringing them to the temple, 63-year-old Dolly Naicker from Newcastle said.Head priest Deon Ramnarain attributed the shortage of the flowers and leaves to the continuous building developments, severe drought and climate change. Despite the economic challenges, devotees generously donated and contributed to the success of the divine prayer festival, Ramnarain said.He said in the past, marigolds and syringa leaves were abundant around Durban but this year the temple society and trust had to put in place extra measures, including buying flowers from farmers to assist pilgrims from as far as Cape Town. This prayer festival is a millenniaold event honouring the divine Mother Mariammen, healer and the mother of rain and fertility, and Maduraiveeran, the guardian, protector and brave warrior, Suresh Naidoo said.During the festival, devotees carry sacred brass and silver clay pots called garagams filled with holy water and decorated with marigolds and syringa leaves.Inside the temple, the 127-year-old Mother Mariammen puthu (the sacred anthill where a snake goddess is believed to live) was decorated with more than 9000 fresh marigold buds and more than 20000 flower buds.Elaborating on the temple s theme of Racism stops with me, Ramnarain said: Racism is a hate crime. The Hindu religion says we are all equal and all are children of God. The colour of our skin must not keep us in hate so we should treat others as we expect them to treat us.
