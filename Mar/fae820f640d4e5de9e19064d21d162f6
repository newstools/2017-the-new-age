The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) says it will tackle head-on, anybody who uses funerals to attack President Jacob Zuma and has vowed to physically disrupt such attempts in the future.This after the funeral of Anti-apartheid stalwart Ahmed Kathrada turned into an occasion where anti-Zuma sentiment was on display.Former President Kgalema Motlanthe quoted an open letter from the late Kathrada in which he called for Zuma s resignation.President Zuma skipped the funeral in accordance with the Kathrada family&#8217;s wishes.Youth League Secretary-General Njabulo Nzuza has accused Chairperson of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation and Minister of Tourism Derek Hanekom of leading an anti-Zuma charge.&#8220;The Chairperson of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation has shamelessly used his privileged position as Chair of this foundation to fight his own battles by barring the President from attending the funeral of his own comrade.&#8220;We respect and applaud President Zuma for respecting the &#8220;wishes of the family&#8221; and to declare the funeral as a state funeral, however the usage of this funeral to attack the President of the ANC will not be accepted by the ANC Youth League,&#8221; said Nzuza in a statement.ANC KwaZulu-Natal chairperson Sihle Zikalala accused Motlanthe of upstaging Kathrada s funeral. If they are concerned about the state of affairs of the ANC, they must use internal structures instead of using funerals to vent, Zikalala said.The Youth League on Thursday reaffirmed its support for Zuma saying &#8220;the ANC Youth League will remain the Family of President Zuma, he is welcomed all the time as a father figure and a struggle icon who played a big role to liberate this country in the ANC Youth League.&#8221;This is not the first time that a funeral was used to express anti-Zuma sentiment.Last year Anglogold Chairman Sipho Pityana delivered an anti-Zuma speech during the funeral of ANC veteran Makhenkhesi Stofile.Pityana has since become a vocal detractor of the Zuma administration and has established the Save SA campaign.
