Police in Welkom suspect a crime syndicate after two businesses were robbed in similar fashion two days in a row. Police spokesperson Const Kethabile Mofokeng said the modus operandi was the same in both robberies where men wearing balaclavas fled with an undisclosed amount of money. She said the victims in both cases were assaulted with a gun. In the first incident which happened on January 13 at the Engen garage in Flamingo Park, the first man came inside the premises and immediately went out while the second one was standing at the door. While that person was still at the door, another came in and went to the fridge pretending to buy something before going to the cashier to buy airtime, Mofokeng said. She said as the cashier opened the till the man pulled out a gun, pointed it at the cashier and demanded cash and the keys to the safe. A petrol attendant came in a few seconds later followed by the other two suspects with firearms. They instructed them to lie down. Then two customers entered the store and they were also instructed to lie on the floor. Mofokeng said one of the customers was robbed of cash and forced to withdraw more money from the ATM inside the garage before he was hit with a gun on his forehead. They left the garage with an undisclosed amount of cash from the till and cigarettes driving a white Toyota Corolla with an unknown registration. The following day at Rheederpark, a bottle store was robbed. The owner was with her sister, cousin and two male friends when three men arrived, threatened them with firearms and demanded money. Two robbers took the sister inside the house, demanding keys to the safe. When she said she did not have the keys, she was assaulted with a gun. The robbers managed to open the safe with a wire and took an undisclosed amount of cash before fleeing on foot. Mofokeng said anyone with the information that may lead to the arrest of the suspects should contact Det-WO Jerry Lenyane on 0714118251 or 0834268343. BECKER SEMELA
