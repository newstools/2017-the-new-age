THE Gupta family has dismissed reports of them having control of government officials and cabinet ministers as nothing but fake news .The family s lawyer, Gert van der Merwe, said the weekend reports relied on undisclosed documents and assumptions of impropriety, resulting in a clear intention to influence political perception. I invite the newsrooms relying on these documents to disclose them and the sources from which they were ostensibly obtained to my client for consideration and comment if possible, he said. Once the documents have been studied and verified, my client would be in a position to comment if necessary. The family deny any wrongdoing or paying any amounts to ministers or the president and reserve its rights. Two weekend publications yesterday ran reports based on explosive emails and letters that claim the Guptas were consulted in the appointment of Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane. The reports claimed Zwane s CV was sent to the family a month before his appointment.Among the claims in the reports was that the Gupta family had been central to a scheme for the president and his family to get residency in Dubai.The reports further stated that a letter circulated by President Jacob Zuma s son, Duduzane Zuma, and Tony Gupta addressed to senior officials in the United Arab Emirates suggest President Jacob Zuma wanted residency for himself and his family.The emails also implicate several ministers and politicians, showing how they were influenced by the Guptas and coached by them in responding to media queries.Van der Merwe said there had been severe haste to publish the stories yesterday so as to create a political perception. He said he was going to obtain the documents mentioned in the articles before taking any further action.TNA Reporter
