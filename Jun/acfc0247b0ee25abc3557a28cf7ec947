Mineral Resources Minister Msebenzi Zwane was on Friday forced to leave addressing a meeting held in Middleburg, Mpumalanga, as a section of the audience booed and disrupted the proceedings.Zwane was expected to brief the community on the newly announced Mining Charter which sought to increase percentage of black mining ownership to 30%.However, part of the audience attending the Imbizo proved rowdy resulting in the minister having to leave the meeting.&#8220;You cannot come to another man&#8217;s yard and do as you please,&#8221; the crowd shouted.Despite the pandemonium, Zwane said he was not embarrassed by what happened at the community hall. I am not embarrassed at all about the disruptions, the minister said.The reviewed mining charter has caused a lot of uncertainty for stakeholders and the markets, with claims by the Chamber of Mines, among others, that there had been no consultation.The chamber rejected it out rightly, saying there had been no meaningful consultations before the introduction of some of the items, and thus it would approach the courts to interdict its implementation.-Sipho Jack
