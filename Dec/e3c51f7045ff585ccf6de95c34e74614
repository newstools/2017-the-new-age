Amnesty International has welcomed the prosecution of five Lesotho soldiers for allegedly trying to kill a newspaper journalist in the country in July 2016. The editor of the Lesotho Times Lloyd Mutungamiri was shot outside his house in Maseru on 6 July after his newspaper published a story alleging that the outgoing Lesotho Defence Force head, Tlali Kamoli, was to receive an exit package of approximately US$3.5 million. Mutungamiri was shot two times and left in a critical condition after one of the bullets shattered his lower jaw, requiring him to undergo extensive facial surgery. A brigadier and four soldiers are due to stand trial for the attack. The soldiers will make their first court appearance on Wednesday. Amnesty International Director for Southern Africa, Deprose Muchena said the trial needs to send a message to those targeting journalists. “This trial needs to send a clear message that the targeting of journalists will no longer be tolerated in Lesotho. The press must be allowed to do their job without living in constant fear of reprisals.” “Lloyd Mutungamiri’s world has been turned upside down since the shooting. He was forced to abandon his job and flee the country.” According to Amnesty International, On 24 June 2016, the day after the Tlali Kamoli article was published, Mutungamiri and Lesotho Times reporter, Keiso Mohloboli, were interrogated by police and members of LDF about what had been published, before being released. Amnesty International said following this, Mutungamiri and Lesotho Times owner Basildon Peta were interrogated on 5 July, four days before the shooting. “Our hope is that, through a fair, independent and impartial trial, justice is served and journalists can carry out their work in a safe environment,” Muchena Said. -TNA Reporter
