Five key moments in German coach Uli Stielike&#8217;s tenure with South Korea, after his departure was announced on Thursday:&#8211; Asian Cup final, January 2015 &#8211;After Stielike&#8217;s appointment in September 2014, South Korea reach the Asian Cup final without conceding a goal, before going down 2-1 after extra time to hosts Australia in Sydney. South Korea had been showered with toffees, a Korean insult, after returning winless from the 2014 World Cup, but this time they are treated as heros.&#8211; Defeat to Spain, June 2016 &#8211;South Korea&#8217;s unbeaten run of 16 games since the Asian Cup final comes crashing to a halt as they are outclassed 6-1 by Spain in a friendly in Austria.&#8211; China challenge, September 2016 &#8211;South Korea open their final World Cup qualifying group with a 3-2 victory over China in Seoul, but they are made to sweat as China storm back from 3-0 down and threaten to snatch a draw.&#8211; The Lippi effect, March 2017 &#8211;Yu Dabao scores the only goal as China, now led by World Cup-winning coach Marcello Lippi, stun South Korea 1-0 in Changsha in World Cup qualifying. Yu&#8217;s first-half header gives China only their second win over South Korea in 32 attempts.&#8211; Disaster in Doha, June 2017 &#8211;Stielike&#8217;s team suffer a shock 3-2 defeat to Qatar &#8212; who register their first win over South Korea in 32 years &#8212; to leave their direct qualification for next year&#8217;s World Cup hanging in the balance.
