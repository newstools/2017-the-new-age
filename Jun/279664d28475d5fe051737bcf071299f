African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) in the Free State has today made a call on its mother body to recall all South African Communist Party (SACP) members deployed in government including MPs and members of provincial legislature (MPL).The call by the ANCYL follows the announcement by the provincial SACP to withdraw its support for the provincial ANC.The provincial SACP said it would contest the upcoming election on its own, arguing that the ANC was no longer advancing the National Democratic Revolution (NDR) the party stood for.ANCYL spokesperson Sello Pieterson urged the provincial leadership to replace SACP members serving in government with those of our own . We call on the leadership of the ANC to act swiftly to replace all deployees representing the SACP with the ANCYL vibrant and focused members and graduates. We wish the SACP well on its lonely and politically faulty road against the people s liberation movement, Pieterson said.He also send a stern warning to Cosatu, warning that no alliance partner should make threats to the ANC and start believing they are the only ones entitled to talking radical political decisions .The young lions claimed the SACP had abandoned its socialist struggles and was now focused on personality cult . Today the SACP is bold to attribute all that its anti-progressive to the ANC as though they have not taken active part in the collective decisions of the Alliance.We dare the SACP and its general secretary Blade Nzimande to contest elections alone as they had threatened, and demonstrate their willingness to be hammered at the polls, he said.-Sipho Jack
