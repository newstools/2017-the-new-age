Taskin Ahmed claimed New Zealand batting talisman Kane Williamson for his maiden Test wicket as Bangladesh continued to control the first Test on the third day in Wellington on Saturday.Williamson, attempting a rescue mission with Tom Latham, had just reached his half-century when he was caught behind and New Zealand went to tea at 186-2 in reply to Bangladesh&#8217;s 595-8 declared.On a pitch that no longer appears to hold any demons, Latham was not out 65 with Ross Taylor on 36.Williamson and Latham put on 77 for the second wicket after Jeet Ravel went before lunch for 27.Both wickets were caught behind by Imrul Kayes, filling in as the gloveman while Mushfiqur Rahim has an injured hand attended to.After resuming the day at 542-7, Bangladesh continued long enough for Sabbir Rahman to become their fifth player to pass the half-century mark in an innings headlined by Shakib Al Hasan&#8217;s 217.Sabbir, dropped on 31 by Latham, was unbeaten on 54 when Bangladesh declared and immediately put pressure on New Zealand with the unorthodox decision to have spinner Mehedi Hasan open the bowling.It nearly paid dividends when he found the edge of Raval&#8217;s bat in his second over but the ball went through the vacant second slip position.Raval was later dropped on 24 off Taskin before Kayes made no mistake with the third offering from the New Zealand opener.Williamson had looked comfortable until he moved to 53 with a boundary off Taskin and then prodded at the next delivery outside his off stump to be caught behind.Taylor, who needs one more century to equal his late mentor Martin Crowe on the New Zealand record of 17 hundreds, has peppered the boundaries in his short time in the middle.His 36 has come off 33 deliveries and includes six fours while Latham has faced 131 balls for his 65.AFP
