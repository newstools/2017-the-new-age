Two men will appear in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court in Cape Town today for allegedly being found with an assortment of firearms and explosives after their case was postponed on Monday. Western Cape police said brothers, Matthew Broderick Breet and Sheldon Jaret Breet were arrested by the Hawks on Saturday in connection with the alleged murder of Brian Wainstein. Police spokesperson Lloyd Ramovha said the two will face additional charges after further investigations uncovered a stockpile of ammunition, four grenades, firearms and military hand radios. “Some of the finds were made in the car that Matthew had driven before the arrest,” Ramovha said. He said Wainstein was reportedly shot and killed in front of his wife and child in the early hours of 18 August at their Constantia home. The gunmen allegedly took cellphones before they fled, leaving the wife and child unharmed. Another man, Fabian Cupido was arrested in October for his alleged involvement in the murder. -TNA Reporter
