President Jacob Zuma has left the nation guessing.In a dramatic move yesterday, he recalled Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan from an overseas road show. Gordhan boarded a flight from London to Johannesburg last night with speculation rife that he is about to be axed.His deputy Mcebisi Jonas who was set to join Gordhan on the US leg of the road show was also forced to cancel his trip last night. Zuma s long-awaited and likely Cabinet reshuffle could be prompted, according to sources, by rising tensions in the top echelons of the ANC.The timing for a reshuffle now seems right. Last weekend s national executive committee (NEC) was the penultimate before the mid-meeting policy conference. Parliament goes into recess at the end of this week, while Zuma has already moved to take charge of key cabinet subcommittees such as communications and social development.Incessant pressure from ANC loyalists to wield the axe in the Cabinet has reached a peak. Zuma has adopted hard-line positions on fundamental policy issues such as land reform and economic transformation.But if he is about to throw down the gauntlet, Luthuli House claims it is out of the loop.In a terse six-minute question and answer session with the media on the outcome of the party s NEC meeting in Johannesburg, ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe said the ANC could not be held to account for Zuma s decision on the matter.Mantashe said the linking of Gordhan s unexpected return to the country to corridor whispers of a looming Cabinet reshuffle should remain in the realm of speculation .His comments came on the eve of Gordhan s bid to the Gauteng high court in Pretoria to seek a ruling that he does not have the power to intervene in matters between banks and clients.Yesterday morning the rand had led gains by developing nations, advancing 11% against dollar but by the afternoon it was the worst performer in emerging markets.Political analyst Sipho Seepe said that the nature of the recall was unusual, while the DA described Zuma s action as a setback for the economy.DA shadow minister of finance David Maynier hit out at Zuma for not offering an explanation for his decision which is fuelling speculation .While Gordhan will comply with the order, according to a person familiar with the situation, the road show is still going ahead, Kevin Daly, a money manager at Aberdeen Asset Management said. Whether this is a reshuffle or not, the timing is definitely picked to inflict pain and embarrassment on an already live-wire situation, George Herman, chief investment officer at Citadel Investment Services in Cape Town, said.Moody s Investors Service, which rates South Africa s debt at two levels above junk and with a negative outlook, is scheduled to publish a review of the nation s creditworthiness on April 7.BONOLO SELEBANO AND BERNARD SATHEKGE&nbsp;
