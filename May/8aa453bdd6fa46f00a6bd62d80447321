A spate of withdrawals has hit the upcoming Tel Aviv International LGBT Film Festival which takes place from June 1-10.The withdrawals follow after pressure group Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) called for the mass boycott of Israel and all its government sponsored initiatives.Among those who have withdrawn their films from the festival is South African film director John Trengove, the brains behind The Wound, a local film about the traditional Xhosa initiation ceremony.Trengove cited human rights violations and pressure from activists groups as reason for the boycott.The filmmaker says he supports the festival and what it stands for as a progressive and open-minded festival, but feels that as long as circumstances in Israel prevail, a rigorous boycott against all government funded initiatives is necessary. In the last few days I have been approached by activist organisations as well as members of the South African film community, urging me to respect the cultural boycott against Israel and specifically TLVfest. It is impossible to look past the fact that the festival (and my participation in it) could serve as a diversion from the human rights violations being committed by the state of Israel. Trengove apologised for the last minute notification and said it was not a personal attack on the festival, but motivated by realisation of what deeply personal and political convictions require of me .The film festival which has been around for more than a decade, showcases LGBTI films from Israel and abroad in a bid to promote full social and political equality to all, regardless of religion, race, sex or sexual orientation.Fawzia Mirza, a Pakistani-Canadian actress and filmmaker who was scheduled to be a jurist, also pulled out of her commitment to the festival, citing her identity as a Muslim queer person as the primary reason for pulling out .The festival s jury is made up of filmmakers and activists from around the world including Samira Saraya and Maysaloun Hamoud who self-identify as Palestinian-Israelis.Some of the prominent attendees still scheduled to take part include American actress Mink Stole and Italian director Fabio Mollo.SIYABONGA SITHOLEsiyabongas@thenewage.co.za
