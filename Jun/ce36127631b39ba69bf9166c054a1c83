Brazil&#8217;s Supreme Court on Thursday sent a corruption charge against President Michel Temer to Congress, which is due to decide on whether the president should be put on trial.&#8220;The House of Deputies received the bribery charge against the president of the republic, Michel Temer, this morning,&#8221; the lower chamber said in a statement.A lower house committee will take up the case, hearing arguments by Temer&#8217;s defense before voting a recommendation on how to proceed.The full chamber will then vote on whether to accept the charge. A two thirds majority would be needed to trigger the suspension of Temer for six months and the start of a trial in the Supreme Court.Temer this week became the first sitting president in Brazil&#8217;s history to be indicted for a crime.Prosecutors, who have already uncovered a vast network of bribery and embezzlement in top political and business circles, say Temer took bribes from the JBS meatpacking company.Temer denies the allegation, calling it &#8220;fiction&#8221; and his aides believe he can muster enough votes in Congress to get the charge thrown out. The prosecutor general, Rodrigo Janot, says that two more corruption charges could follow.-AFP
