President Jacob Zuma has sidestepped a written Parliamentary question regarding whether he has reported those responsible for corruption to the police.However, he has reiterated his government s determination to do even more to defeat the scourge of corruption.Last November, the President claimed at a meeting in Pietermaritzburg that he knew who was responsible for corruption.He reportedly said: It s like those who steal today they say Zuma steals while they are the worst thieves. They have investigated me all over but they are finding nothing because I m not doing anything. If they have found it, it would be over (for me). Those are the thieves and I know they are stealing. I m just watching them. I know them. Cope member of Parliament Deidre Carter has asked him in writing whether in the light of these claims he has reported these corrupt transactions to the South African Police Service.The President replied that he had instructed the anti-corruption task team to work tirelessly to root out corruption at all levels of the public service.A lot of good work has been done as reported recently by the anti-corruption interministerial committee. Since April 2013, he had signed more than 27 proclamation orders which resulted in the special investigating unit recovering cash or assets worth R204m, Zuma said.Contracts valued at R755m have been cancelled, while in the past three years 32 people involved in corruption cases totalling R3bn were arrested. In addition, 58 people were convicted following their involvement in fraud to the value of R200m. We are committed to do even more to defeat the scourge of corruption. We do not only talk about fighting corruption, but we are doing something about it, Zuma said.The cases he had mentioned, Zuma said, attested to the seriousness of this commitment. We will continue to speak out to discourage unethical behaviour.DENNIS CRUYWAGENnews@thenewage.co.za
