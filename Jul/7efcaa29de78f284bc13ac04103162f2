Reckless, unsafe overtaking can be fatal, with serious consequences for those involved in these crashes and for their loved ones. These roads also had to be closed until the crash sites had been cleared, which caused serious traffic delays and congestion. :Drivers under the influence put their own lives and those of their passengers in danger and they endanger the lives of other road users. If you re drinking, don t drive or walk on roads. Help create booze-free roads. If you have friends or family who still drive under the influence, speak to them before they get into trouble with the law.
