The South African Police Service (Saps) says the police in Kimberley and all over the Northern Cape are out in full swing, to make sure that communities are and feel safe during the festive season. Vehicle, bicycle, air and foot patrols in town, shopping centres and malls have become more visible than ever before. Provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Mohale Ramatseba said the police were also visiting ATMs and conversing with bank staff and the community about safety and vigilance around the withdrawing and carrying of money. “The police also had talks with business owners and even car guards on how to safe guard their property and that of others,” Ramatseba said. Mobile Community Service Centres have been placed at malls and shopping centres to protect shoppers during the festive season. Ramatseba said vehicle check points are held randomly in residential areas and at all entrances of towns and cities in the Northern Cape. These operations will continue during the festive season and beyond. -TNA Reporter
