The ANC has called on South Africans celebrating Freedom Day to reflect on the role that each citizen has to play in ensuring a national democratic society.&#8221; Such a society is one that is based on the best in human civilisation in terms of political and human freedoms, socio-economic rights, value systems and identity,&#8221;&#8221; It is also one that guarantees social emancipation and a better quality of life for all, especially the poor,&#8221;&#8221; Its attainment requires ongoing decisive action by society led by the ANC government to effect thorough-going economic transformation and democratic consolidation,&#8221; said the party in a statement.According to the ANC while South Africa in 2017 is a better place to live in than it was in 1994 the governing party has acknowledged that there remains many challenges to overcome.&#8221; South Africa continues to represent the most acute manifestation of most of the social fault-lines that define humanity s current challenges: race, class, gender and geographic location.&#8221; Income inequality and inequitable distribution of assets are at their most intense. Poverty and unbridled opulence live side by side &#8221; reads the ANC statement.The party has also called on South Africans to guard against certain sectors of its population who wish to reverse the gains of the democratic society.&#8221; We must at all times remain vigilant of certain sections of our population who were the beneficiaries of the old order and are bent on either reversing this achievement or at best stall the progress, &#8221;&#8221; Ours is to confront those elements intent undermining the popular electoral mandate in order to reverse the gains of our hard-won democracy,&#8221; said the ANC.Meanwhile the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has criticised the ANC saying despite securing the right to vote the majority of black people remain poor.&#8221; The right to vote managed to secure political power for black people in the form of the government which was supposed to be used to deliver the total economic emancipation of our people,&#8221;&#8221; However, over 23 years, the ANC has weakened the state and its institutions through corruption and thus undermined all claims that ours is a prosperous society,&#8221; said EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi in a statement.-TNA Reporter
