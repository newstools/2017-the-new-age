It is that time of the year when all one hears are compliments of the season, so, compliments to you all. Now back to the business of writing my thoughts on the sporting arena.With all that s been happening since my last column in December, one feels like a mosquito in a nudist camp. So much to say and so little space.It would be great to explore the Keagan Dolly versus Mamelodi Sundowns saga further, but will it really get us anywhere?One may be wrong but one gets the feeling that Dolly is being short-changed here. Whether what was earlier said by the African champions coach, Pitso Jingles Mosimane, that no player in South Africa is worth R10m, referred only as far as movement within local clubs was concerned or not was not made clear.Well, we know better now. There are those worth double that and more for overseas clubs considering the fluctuating state of the rand.If only everything in life was decided the way the Premier Soccer League s dispute resolution committee did with this issue, accepting the excuse Sundowns gave of a mistake having been made on a signed contract.Days later, in what seemed to be the real reason why Sundowns fought this case so much, Mosimane said Dolly isn t ready to go overseas as there are areas he still has to improve on.Here are some quick stats to ponder; Mosimane was 25 years old when he joined Greek side Ionikos in 1989 and earned four Bafana Bafana caps between 1993 and 1994. He started coaching at 37 in 2001 at Supersport United and at 46 he was at the helm of the national team. Six years later at 52 he is the best coach on the continent. How did he achieve that? By being given opportunities at an early age with no one standing in his way.Dolly is 23 years old, captained the U-23 side admirably until qualification for the Rio 2016 Olympics, is a regular for Bafana Bafana, plays week in and week out for Sundowns and is a CAF Champions League winnerHe played at the Fifa Club World Cup, was nominated for CAF player of the year based in Africa and has been named in CAF Africa finest XI alongside illustrious company in Leicester City s Riyad Mahrez of Algeria and Liverpool s Sadio Mane of Senegal among others.With all these accolades we are told he is not ready. You be the judge.-Sello Rabothata
