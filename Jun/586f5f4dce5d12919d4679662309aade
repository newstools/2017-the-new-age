A prominent opposition leader jailed in Venezuela, Leopoldo Lopez, urged more street protests against the &#8220;tyranny&#8221; of President Nicolas Maduro, in a video message made in his cell and released on Sunday.Lopez, 46, however stressed several times that he backed only &#8220;peaceful&#8221; demonstrations.Prosecutors in Venezuela say 65 people have died since April 1, when near-daily pro- and anti-Maduro rallies turned more violent, with protesters and security forces targeted.The opposition and anti-Maduro protesters are demanding early elections to force out the widely unpopular president, who has ruled over the country&#8217;s sharply declining economy.Lopez, looking fit and wearing a white t-shirt and a crucifix around his neck in the video, expressed his &#8220;admiration for the hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans&#8221; who had gone into the streets &#8220;for democracy.&#8221;He added that &#8220;rebellion, resistance and the protests are legitimate&#8221; against a government that was &#8220;despotic,&#8221; &#8220;tyrannical&#8221; and hapless in the face of the economic crisis.The struggle evinced by the protests, he said, was &#8220;historic&#8221; and &#8220;cannot end until we have reached victory.&#8221;It was not clear when exactly the video was recorded. The version released on YouTube on Sunday was timestamped &#8220;June 2017.&#8221;It was made public after Lopez, who was detained in 2014 and sentenced to 14 years behind bars on charges of inciting violence in anti-government protests, was visited in prison by Spanish former prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero.Zapatero is leading an effort to build dialogue between the opposition and Maduro&#8217;s government to de-escalate the situation.Lopez and Zapatero held a &#8220;conversation with much respect,&#8221; according to a message on the opposition leader&#8217;s Twitter account, which is handled by his wife Lilian Tintori.Zapatero was accompanied by Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez and her brother Jorge Rodriguez, who is mayor of a Caracas district, the account said.-AFP
