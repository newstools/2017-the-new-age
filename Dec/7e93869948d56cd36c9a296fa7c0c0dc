The Interpol has reportedly arrested Cuban fugitive Nelson Pablo Yester-Garrido in Rome, Italy. Yester-Garrido has been on the most wanted list in the United States for his alleged role in smuggling large quantities of cocaine in the 1990s and negotiating to buy a Soviet-era submarine for a Colombian drug cartel. Garrido has been living in South Africa and was based in Sandton Johannesburg. The Hawks arrested him in 2002 acting on an Interpol warrant that detailed charges including racketeering and conspiracy to import narcotics to the United States, but was never prosecuted after it is alleged Radovan Krejcir paid a bribe to let him off the hook. During Yester-Garrido’s arrest, police seized a Mercedes Benz SL500, R30 000 and fraudulent passports were found. While he was in the country disguised as Antonio Lamas Pablo Yester-Garrido has been living in Johannesburg since 2002. At this time of publication of this report, it’s still unclear what Garrido was doing in Rome. Previously it would seem that Yester-Garrido has a long history of arrests. In addition to the 2002 arrest, he was arrested in South Africa in October 2011 on an Interpol red notice. At the time it was expected that he would be extradited to the US to face charges but the charges were also dropped. He was released on R600 000 bail by the Motherwell Magistrate’s Court. At the time he was allegedly associated with drug-trade network Radovan Krejcir. His name has also cropped up in regard to former national police boss Jackie Selebi and convicted drug dealer Glenn Agliotti. Garrido was, in January this year, also at the centre of allegations that a briefcase containing R700 000 was dropped off in Port Elizabeth to stop a drug prosecution which he was involved was in. -Tna Reporter
