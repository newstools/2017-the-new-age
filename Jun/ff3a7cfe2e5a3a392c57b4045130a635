The kid from the Cape Flats who rebelled against apartheid ends up supporting those same monopoly interests that once oppressed him Friedrich Nietzsche reminds us sometimes people don t want to hear the truth, because they don t want their illusions destroyed .I thought of this when I heard Trevor Manuel unequivocally denying the existence of white-monopoly capital.Manuel, the longest serving finance minister, dared to say there is no such thing as white monopoly capital; reduces it to be the invention of public relations company Bell Pottinger.Manuel was hardly the first to arrive at this dismissive conclusion. He cannot get the credit for originality since he is merely re-echoing from the comfort of his Rothschilds captured position this untruth.For those who regard themselves white it is an identity, from Eurocentric origin, white within the historical trajectory of the human race is a measurement of supremacy. James Baldwin the American essayist and social critic reminded us decades ago there are no white people, only those who think they are white .White therefore as a construct and identity is a living reality the world over as functional in expression of supremacy, which suggests dominance, and therefore control.Therefore to deny that white identity in relation to its historical and prevailing context is to be consciously oblivious to that reality.Manuel, the child from the Cape Flats life defined in claim of liberation struggle, was because there existed a white identity in SA that implemented a system of apartheid that declared Manuel and his family coloured.In resistance to that he was influenced by black consciousness and he therefore adopted a black identity in resistance to that white supremacist notion.Hence Manuel cannot in 2017 venture to deny the white identity he fought against.Webster s dictionary defines a monopoly as the exclusive possession or control of the supply of or trade in a commodity or service . The history of South Africa attests that of a monopoly, the fundamental assets in land and therefore economy is the epicentre of that monopoly claim.The current reality of land ownership confirms that over 83% of the land is still controlled by 12% of the population and that percentage carries the denotation of white for their human agency.A quick review of how the idea of nationality on the part of the Afrikaans-speaking whites took form and became rooted confirms the centrality of the advancement of capitalism in South Africa in the interpretation and defining of a claim of being a nation on the part of the Afrikaans-speaking whites.Motala and Vally, in their reflection of Neville Alexander s epistemology on the unresolved national question help us appreciate how for Alexander the National Party s theory and reasoning for nationality was informed by their struggle for hegemony against the backdrop of the post-war development of capitalism in South Africa.Alexander asserted the overall intentions of the bantustan strategy on the part of the Afrikaans-speaking whites shows definite direct linkages to the growth and development of capitalism in South Africa. The bantustans were crucial for forcing labour into the emerging industrial, agricultural, and commercial economy.More significant was the fact that it became the base for the presence of legislation of various land acts that necessarily and consciously limited land access for the majority of the population and that controlled the movement of and supply of black labour and restraining its resistance to exploitative and oppressive conditions.We refer to the economy as apartheid based because the economy was designed around and for the prevailing interest of those who consider themselves white and therefore supreme.It is in the light of that reality of monopolised dominance that policies like BEE, employment equity and others, came to see the light. Granted these have their own anomalies and contradictions yet it remains a serious attempt at dislodging that monopoly.For Manuel today to argue that the South African society is not monopolised is to hear someone who has betrayed his own ideals and back slid from what he fought against.Capital is defined as wealth in the form of money or other assets owned by a person or organisation or available for a purpose such as starting a company or investing .The central effort of all forms of colonialism was always dispossession of the indigenous people, it was always about robbing others those with the aim of translating that into capital.South Africa therefore fits the profile of a country that successfully served the interest of white monopoly and the ultimate product of that white identity that sought to monopolise everything that remotely was defined in its capitalist interest.The ultimate aim was capital, wealth of assets owned by white individuals and the group that sees themselves as white.What Manuel knows but today denies: He knows that all if not the finest wine farms where he had his second marriage is controlled by that same white identity that have monopolised and therefore own the farms today. He knows the University of Stellenbosch where he serves as chancellor, is the bastion of white interest. He knows that the game farms where he may have hunting expeditions are exclusively owned by that white identity confirming the monopoly. He knows that the banks in South Africa regardless of a white-approved thin slice of black faces, remain white controlled, owned, and managed at a critical level. He knows that the media were for a long time controlled in monopolised ownership by that same white identity. He knows that the construction companies that define the construction economy are the same who colluded to rob the government in the erection of sports infrastructure for the 2010 World Cup and attests to white dominance. He knows anuel that rugby, a sport he loves, is still white controlled, which is abnormal in a society of a black majority, hence his once defiant support for the All Blacks team. He knows that the high-heeled fully capitalised new pseudo civil society formations like Save SA, with its explicit political agenda of removing president, is controlled by the benevolence of white wealth.So Manuel with his new doctrine on capital denies there exists a white identity that has monopolised the economy and controls the vestiges of what makes up South Africa.It is amazing what being associated with the Rothschild family the bastion of white monopoly capital does to a former activist.They first render you a black diamond (the ultimate insult of black identity) then they pummel you with resources and access. Finally you speak for them and repeat their claims in stark contrast to your upbringing and fight for the factory workers of the Cape Flats.Yes, was Manuel not a person who purely by accident became very important in a sphere of financial management and economy for which he was not remotely qualified?I am on record for categorically asserting Manuel rose to be in Mandela s racially inclusive government of national unity thanks to the false notion of a coloured identity, no different to the tricameral leaders like Allan Hendrickse in the apartheid system.Manuel owes his political and now economic success to that social construct of a coloured identity no matter how he may protest.Manuel, who today is the voice of that same colonial, white monopoly capital, has the audacity to lecture us from the comfort of his exceptional wealth, claiming that there is no case for a claim of white monopoly capital.Clyde NS Ramalaine, Weekly Xpose analyst (this article first appeared in Weekly Xpose)
