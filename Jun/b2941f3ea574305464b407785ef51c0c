Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders agreed Sunday to resume talks later this month on reunifying the divided island, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said.The agreement to resume negotiations on a historic deal was reached during a four-hour meeting between the two leaders and Guterres at UN headquarters.Guterres had invited Greek Cypriot leader Nicos Anastasiades and his Turkish Cypriot counterpart Mustafa Akinci for talks to salvage a two-year diplomatic effort aimed at achieving a settlement in Cyprus.Flanked by the two leaders, Guterres told reporters that all three had &#8220;agreed on the need to reconvene the conference on Cyprus in June.&#8221;No firm date was announced and Guterres said he would consult with Britain, the European Union, Greece and Turkey on the timing.The UN-led talks hit a wall nine days ago after the sides failed to agree on the terms to advance the reunification talks toward a final summit.The eastern Mediterranean island has been divided since 1974, when Turkish troops invaded its northern third in response to an Athens-inspired coup seeking union with Greece.The Greek Cypriot side demanded that the withdrawal of Turkish troops be discussed at a conference in Geneva as part of security arrangements.The Turkish Cypriots maintained that the conference should focus on broader issues of power-sharing, property rights and territory for the creation of a new federation.Turkey maintains some 30,000 troops in the north of the island.Following the meeting, Guterres said that &#8220;all agreed that the chapter on security and guarantees is of vital importance to the two communities.&#8221;&#8220;Progress in this chapter is an essential element in reaching an overall agreement and in building trust between the two communities in relation to their future security,&#8221; he said.The leaders agreed to continue negotiations on &#8220;all other outstanding issues, starting with territory, property and governance and power-sharing,&#8221; said Guterres.&#8220;All issues will be negotiated interdependently,&#8221; said Guterres, stressing that &#8220;nothing is agreed till everything is agreed.&#8221;-AFP
