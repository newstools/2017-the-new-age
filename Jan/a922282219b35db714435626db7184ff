Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce voiced his concern over Premier League games being played on the final day of the January window, saying players will struggle to maintain concentration levels amid a whirlwind of transfer activity.Palace, who are third-bottom of the table and two points away from safety, make the trip to the south coast to face 12th-placed Bournemouth on Tuesday.&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to start getting results, beginning with Bournemouth. Games are slipping by,&#8221; Allardyce told reporters on Monday.&#8220;Playing a game right on the last day of the window affects the mentality of the players. Constant rumours are disruptive. It&#8217;s not very productive, trying to focus and prepare the team for one of the most important games of the season.&#8221;Allardyce, however, expects a busy deadline day at Selhurst Park.&#8220;Martin Caceres (former Juventus defender) is one who may appear after the window as he&#8217;s not attached to a club. Yes, I have an interest,&#8221; he said.&#8220;We&#8217;re still hunting for at least two players. We&#8217;re sitting with as many people as we possibly can. Whatever happens in the next 48 hours is frantic: could be many, could be none.&#8221;Allardyce is yet to win a league match since taking over from Alan Pardew last month.&#8220;I&#8217;d be so happy with a 0-0 draw tomorrow. It would please me immensely. It&#8217;s a starting point for our survival,&#8221; the former England manager said.-Reuters
