Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has on Tuesday confirmed that there are only 20 000 places left in the province s for grades ones and eights.To date the department has received more than 300 000 applications for the 2018 academic year.&#8220;I want to thank South Africans especially people from Gauteng. Last year by this time we had about 100 000 applications but this year we have reached 300 000 applications,&#8221; said Lesufi.He added this had put his department on a strong footing.&#8220;So now if a parent comes to me around January stating that they are looking for space, I will give them space but it won&#8217;t be at the place of their choice. So if there is a space in Tembisa and you live in Centurion (that is where the child will be placed).&#8221;On the 2 May, MEC Lesufi together with the Premier of Gauteng David Makhura launched the improved online application registration system in Orange Farm multipurpose centre for grade 1 and grade 8 learners for the 2018 school year.At least 23 000 applications were captured in the first hour of the online application registration system being live.Applications will run until 12 June midnight.-TNA Reporter
