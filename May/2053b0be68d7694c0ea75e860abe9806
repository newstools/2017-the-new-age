Supersport United are hoping to take a leaf out of Mamelodi Sundowns good run in continental football when they take on DR Congo giants TP Mazembe on Sunday in the CAF Confederation Cup.Having watched their neighbours Sundowns beat Mazembe in the CAF Super Cup at the beginning of the season, United are confident that they too can beat them. The only challenge is that Stuart Baxter s men will play the DR Congo side at a packed Stade du TP Mazembe in Lumumbashi. Having started the group stages well and sitting pretty at the top of their group with four points with Mazembe second with the same number of points, striker Jeremy Brockie believes United have what it takes to stun the defending Confed Cup champions. It will be a big game for the club. We started the group well. We are on top. To play there will be intimidating. We will be on an artificial pitch. We have a good team to overcome, Brockie said. The main thing is to come back with the points. They are a big physical team. They gave Sundowns a run for their money when they were at the top of their game. It won t be easy. With two teams qualifying out of the group, we are hoping to be one of them.It is taxing to play Mazembe and then Pirates, but it is what you want. It is a good thing for us to have a prefinal meeting against strong opposition before the Nedbank Cup final. That will be good preparation for us. SuperSport won their previous Confederation Cup game against Gabon side CF Mounana 5-3, with Brockie scoring a brace. However, it was not enough to earn Brockie a call-up to the New Zealand national team that will face Ireland on Friday.While that has left him disappointed, the striker, who is attracting interest from Sundowns and Orlando Pirates, said he saw it coming. I got a feeling that it might come. It is disappointing. I have to get over that pretty quickly and focus on the Nedbank Cup final, Brockie said.-MMASEKEPE MATSEBANE|mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
