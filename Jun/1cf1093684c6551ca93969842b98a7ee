Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba has rubbished reports that he paved the way for the Gupta family to receive South African citizenship.&#8220;It is not true that Minister Gigaba &#8216;opened the gates&#8217; for the Gupta family as the family has been permanent residents in South Africa since 2008. And there is no bombshell in relation to this matter, given that everything was done within the prescripts of the law,&#8221; said Treasury in a statement.According to Gigaba documents circulated through social media on Monday with respect to the Gupta family naturalisation application are genuine.&#8220;The application was handled in line with the procedure that requires that the Department of Home Affairs submits recommendations to the Minister for consideration,&#8221; said Gigaba.He added that the granting of naturalisation certificates of this nature is not unusual.&#8220;Similar courtesies have been extended to prominent businessmen, including executives of multi-nationals, and sports people. There is no impropriety on the part of the Minister in relation to how the application in question has been handled,&#8221; said Gigaba.In the interest of transparency, Minister Gigaba has requested the Department of Home Affairs to make the motivation pertaining to this particular application, and any other issue relating to the Gupta family, available to the media. I have requested the Department of Home Affairs to provide chronological details of how all applications by the Gupta family have been handled by the Department of Home Affairs from the beginning. We have no doubt that the whole process has been handled by the book in terms of our laws, said Gigaba.-TNA Reporter
