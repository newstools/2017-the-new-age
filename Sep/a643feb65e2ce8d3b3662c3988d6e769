MEC for Infrastructure Development (DID) in Gauteng, Jacob Mamabolo has began his site visits to nab the non-performance of the contractor in the goverment infrastructures.On Monday Mamabolo visited Randfontein High School in the West Rand where the department is doing renovations and refurbishments that cost about R34 million.The visit comes after complaints that were lodged by the school principal, that the work was lagging behind schedule and had caused massive inconvenience and expense to the school.&#8220;Government will not tolerate the emerging culture of treating the state as an outlet for incompetence and mediocrity. We are committed to intensify efforts to ensure that projects are delivered in time, quality and within cost, in line with the key objectives of the Project Readiness Matrix,&#8221; Mamabolo said in a statement.Last week the minister pronounce the Project Readiness Matrix (PRM) as a proprietary tool developed by the Department to rigorously track the more than 160 steps required for the successful completion of all infrastructure projects undertaken by the Department.The PRM is a tracking tool within Lutsinga Infrastructure House that empowers the department not only to swifly identify non-performing of contractors and address issues as they occur.-ANN7 Reporter
