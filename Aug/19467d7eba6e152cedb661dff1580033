Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela s problems seem to be far from over as his side continues with a winless streak of the 2017/18 season.The Soweto giants were knocked out in the first stage of the MTN8 Cup by SuperSport United, before drawing 1-1 with Bloemfontein Celtic in their opening match of the league.However, the situation deteriorated when they lost again to SuperSport United in the league on Wednesday at the FNB Stadium. The outspoken coach said that people do not understand his decisions. Sometimes the decision taken by the coaches are crazy but at the end of the match, you start to understand. People will never understand what you say but will understand what you said. That needs a lot of reflections and processes but when they look back they see that this guy was trying to say this. I am the biggest casualty that when I say something is not understood but after sometime, it gets to be understood. You don t need to explain too much because it becomes otherwise, said Komphela.Things don&#8217;t look good for Komphela as he will travel to Cape Town to face Cape Town City on 13 September who have not lost a single match this season. After that tough clash, they will travel back to take on the defending champions Bidvest Wits.After that tough clash, they will travel back to take on the defending champions Bidvest Wits.
