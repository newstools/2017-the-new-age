FOLLOWING the success of the match officials and league administrators course held by South African Breweries (SAB) and Safa, the country s largest grassroots football development league will once again host the SAB League Skills camp.This year, 52 coaches from different Safa regions will be invited to participate in the CAF C licence coaching course to be held at the High Performance Centre in Pretoria from February 5 until the 15th.The invaluable skills initiative stems from SAB s vision of using football as an effective tool in making a meaningful contribution to local communities. More than 30000 young football players from different parts of the country compete in the SAB League, which has already produced a number of the country s top footballers.Beyond the playing pitch, the SAB League study assistance programme also provides opportunity for players to further their education at tertiary level. SAB s firm belief in development has now been extended to coaches through the CAF C licence coaching course which introduces them to the most recent coaching methods exclusively developed by technical instructors and coaches from the governing body. Senior national team assistant coach and SAB League coach in Limpopo Thabo Senong is among top coaches expected to share their knowledge of the course. It is always rewarding to witness such programmes for coaches at a grassroots level, Senong said. I myself am a SAB League coach graduate and it is highly important that courses such as these are offered to ensure that there is a high level of professionalism during early developmental stages. This also contributes to the standard and quality of coaches produced in the country. SAB economic development manager Octavius Phukubye emphasised SAB s commitment to football development ahead of the course. Our investment in grassroots football development continues to evolve in a manner that empowers various role players across the value chain of football in South Africa, Phukubye said.news@thenewage.co.za-TNA Reporter
