controversy marred the provincial finals of the Danone U-12 Nations Cup after perennial campaigners BM Mokitime Primary School was disqualified at a time it looked poised to win.The Mahikeng school came under scrutiny following player eligibility issues. This opened room for Mmamitlwa Primary School to emerge almost through the back door.The school took full advantage of the opportunity and won the provincial title and with it the right to represent the province at the competition s national finals in Boksburg in July.Mmamitlwa had finished third on the log after the round-robin stage of last Saturday s provincial finals in Klerksdorp, but the team that finished top of the log, BM Mokitime, was disqualified because of player eligibility issues, which elevated the former into the final.There, they met Inyatelo Primary School in the final, which ended in a one-all draw.Mmamitlwa went on to win the penalty shoot-out to become the provincial champions in their first appearance in the finals.Moses Mahau, coach of Mmamitlwa, was very impressed by the standard of his team. It exceeded my expectations. The competition was tough and it was clear that all the schools came with the aim of winning the North West title, Mahau said.There was a lot of talent on display and it was disappointing that the undoubted star of the day was from the disqualified school. I m thrilled that we won, even though it seemed that we wouldn t have made it in the beginning. After the disqualification, the players were excited to be given a second opportunity to fight to win the title and were not going to let it go to waste, Mahau said.The team made a number of mistakes on the day that will have to be corrected if they are to do well at the national finals, the coach said.In their first match, against BM Mokitime Primary School, they lost 1-0 and Mahau admitted they were beaten by a better team.Their second match was against Inyatelo Primary School, the team they were to meet again in the final. They lost 1-0, but Mahau was not discouraged because it was their first time playing in the provincial finals.They put it together in the final pool game against Tshwaraganelo Primary School, winning 4-1 and the team was upbeat and confident going into the final.Neither team were willing to lose this opportunity to play at the national finals.Mmamitlwa managed to convert all their penalties, while Inyatelo Primary could only score once.The team now has its sights set on the national trophy that comes with a berth at the world stage.ELFAS TORERAIelfast@thenewage.co.za
