UNBEKNOWN to many, this week marks national marriage week, (September 1 to 7), an annual celebration dedicated to equipping couples with knowledge and inspiration to build happy and strong marriages.So don t be surprised if you come across several Yes Your Marriage Matters themed messages, if your are married of course, in your email inbox or social media time lines at least until tomorrow when the initiative comes to a close.The annual campaign comes at a time when many prospective brides and grooms are wondering if is it really worth getting married? , given marriages have an approximately 50% chance of lasting. The purpose of SA Marriage Week 2017 is to sow the maximum amount of good seed in marriages, Liezel van der Merwe, founder of SA Marriage Week, said. We want to encourage the restoration of marriages and remind couples that what you sow, you will reap, also in your marriage. According to recent data by Stats SA, there s an 8.1% decline in registered marriages from 2014 to 2015.Another shocking finding revealed that in 2015, there were 14.045 (55.6%) divorces with children aged under 18 years affected.So the big question should be, is there really hope for marriages in the 21st century, with money touted as the number one thing that couples fight about? Money really touches everything. It impacts people s lives, Emmet Burns, brand MD for SunTrust, who conducted a survey showing money as a key contributor to the divorce scourge.However, Marriage Week International is convinced marriage is a brilliant institution and healthy relationships can be cultivated, hence Marriage Week, a time to say wake up , marriage is a great idea, reads a message from its website.According to its founders, a great marriage can be learnt, just the same way as a person can learn to read a book, drive a car or ski down a mountain. Where it all startedPart of Marriage Week International, which is held in various countries around Valentine s Day, SA Marriage Week first came to the attention of South Africans last September when the Department of Social Development caused an uproar tweeting marriage advice which seemed to be nothing more than dangerous assumptions.The department was hosting a Take a Stand for Your Marriage workshop as part of the 4th edition of SA Marriage Week.However it rubbed many the wrong when it live-tweeted some of the statements of the speakers such as: Children do better when they live with married parent .Another tweet, which appeared to have been the straw that actually broke the camel s back and caught the wrath of black Twitter, read: Marriages of today are failing because (of a) lack of submission.
