Tshwane University of Technology has extended its registration until Friday following recent student protest action which led to the closure of the Pretoria (west), Arcadia and Arts Campuses.&nbsp; The University&#8217;s spokesperson Willa de Ruyter denied the rumour that the extension of the registration was as a result of a below minimum number of students who have registered. It was reported that the Institution had blocked students with outstanding debts from 2016 from registering.Ruyter however denied that the university had not blocked NSFAS students who have debts from 2016.&#8220;The extension was due to the time lost during the protest action. This decision was taken in view of the protest action at the Pretoria west and Arcadia that resulted to the suspension of activities on 16 and 17 February, activities resumed yesterday, the 20th of February. But because of the time lost for students who could not register on those days, a decision was taken to extend registration until February the 24th,&#8221; Ruyter said.She said the extension will not affect the academic year &#8220;students are already in class, they started on the 23rd of January and registration is just a formality for students to be part of the administration process.&#8221;Meanwhile De Ruyter said &#8220;as for the exams that were scheduled until the 20th of February, they took place as scheduled and there was no disturbance of any exams.&#8221;She added that everything is calm and continuing as scheduled at all Campuses at the moment. &#8221;We are basically more than 90% done with the registration process,&#8221; she said.De Ruyter adds that by Monday the institution had already registered about 57000 students for 2017. The University will have 60505 registered students for the 2017 Academic year.-TNA Reporter
