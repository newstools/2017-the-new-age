The Special Investigation Unit (SIU) enquiry into the Mhlatuze Water Board was not an enquiry into a particular person but the institution.This was the response of President Jacob Zuma in response to a question from DA member of Parliament Hendrik Schmidt.In his written enquiry, Schmidt asked about the findings of the SIU investigation. The person he was referring to was the head of the SAA Board, Dudu Miyeni.Zuma said: My assumption is that the question by the honourable member is in relation to the investigation that was done by the SIU into the affairs of Mhlatuze Water Board in Richards Bay. The investigation by the SIU was not an investigation into a particular individual but was in relation to Mhlatuze Water Board as an institution and as such, no findings were made in relation to a particular individual. Meanwhile, Justice Minister Michael Masutha said there was still a considerable amount of investigation outstanding into the burglary at the offices of the chief justice.Masutha said the police submitted the docket to the prosecution on May 9 this year. Further investigations were currently under way, he said. Owing to this fact, on May 17 the prosecution postponed the matter in court to July 11. The accused were released on bail, Masutha said.He said the prosecutor had examined the docket and provided further guidance for police enquiries.Masutha gave this explanation in reply to a question from DA chief whip John Steenhuisen.The MP had inquired if the National Prosecuting Authority has received a case for prosecution from the SAPS with regard to its investigations into the break-in at the office of the chief justice on March 18.DENNIS CRUYWAGENdennisc@thenewage.co.za
