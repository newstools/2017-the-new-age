French presidential election favourite Emmanuel Macron said Friday he had already chosen the name of his future prime minister &#8212; but even the person concerned has not been told.&#8220;Yes, this choice has been made &#8216;in petto&#8217;,&#8221; he told Europe 1 radio, using an Italian expression meaning &#8220;in my heart&#8221;.But he said he had not told the person concerned &#8220;because it&#8217;s in my head&#8221;.&#8220;If I&#8217;m elected, I will work to finalise my government next week,&#8221; Macron said.The 39-year-old centrist has come under pressure from Le Pen to reveal his hand ahead of Sunday&#8217;s run-off.Le Pen has said she will appoint eurosceptic ally Nicolas Dupont-Aignan &#8212; who was knocked out in the first round of the election &#8212; as her premier if victorious.Macron said he would only announce his choice after he took over from President Francois Hollande, if he wins.&#8220;I will not announce it before,&#8221; he said.Macron had previously said he was considering various candidates to lead a government he says will be &#8220;neither of the right nor the left&#8221;.In the past, he has said he would prefer to have a woman as prime minister.Macron has a 20-point lead over Le Pen going into the run-off, according to the latest polls.-AFP
