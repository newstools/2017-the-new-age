EXCITEMENT is mounting for Johannesburg party lovers ahead of the highly anticipated global Afropunk festival on December 30-31 at Constitution Hill. The festival annually hosted in New York, Atlanta, London and Paris will be in Joburg for the first time welcoming artists such as Solange Knowles, Anderson Paak and The Free Nationals, Laura Mvula and King Tha. The partnership between these two iconic organisations, Afropunk and Constitution Hill, aims to bring people from all backgrounds and races together. Afropunk is a community celebrating black culture within an openness to multiculturalism, making it a perfect fit for a precinct like Constitution Hill that commemorates what a brutal culture of unconstitutionalism did to South Africa and is now the home of the Constitution that secures South Africans’ rights. Afropunk chose South Africa because of “the South African Constitution, the possibilities, the beauty, the creativity”. “It is known that Constitution Hill was historically a place of degradation. “Prisoners were compelled to take part in the ‘tauza dance’, to ensure that they had nothing hidden in their rectums,” Organisers said. “The prison was closed in 1983, ‘leaving a scar on Joburg’s metropolis a bleak reminder of our painful past. “But now a different, lighter kind of dancing happens on the site which has been creatively transformed into a human rights precinct and is now the home of justice.” In preparation for Afropunk, Constitution Hill has launched a unique tourism collective, “I am Joburg”, for both local and international festival-goers that will descend on Joburg this festive season.
