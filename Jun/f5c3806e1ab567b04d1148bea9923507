We will also have a campaign to improve the working conditions of those in the Expanded Public Works Programme and the quality of training and skills development programmes to increase the employability of young people, Fakude said.Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi said at the rally: There also needs to be urgency in fighting against all forms of corruption and state capture allegations where they emerge must be fully investigated so that those in the wrong should be held accountable.

It is expected to be addressed by ANC deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa.REFILWE MAGASHULE
