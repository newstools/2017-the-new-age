Tshwane city manager Moeketsi Mosola has confirmed receiving a forensic report on Tshwane metro police director Johanna Estresia Trish Armstrong s alleged possession of fraudulent qualifications.Mosola said he was studying the report based on a probe by the city s group audit and risk department in 2014. Mosola has raised the matter of Armstrong with the metro police management and once he has finished studying the forensic report, he will apply his mind and determine the way forward, city of Tshwane group communication and marketing spokesperson Selby Bokaba said.He said Armstrong was suspended and dismissed from the metro police in 2015, but she appealed the judgment in the Labour Court, which set aside the sanction. At the time of her suspension and subsequent dismissal on June 3, 2015, Armstrong was employed as director: research and resource development.Upon her reinstatement to the Tshwane police on May 1, 2016, she was redeployed to the position director: tactical police operations, Bokaba said.The alleged fraudulent documents include a diploma she allegedly claimed she attained from Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Police Training academy, an honours degree from the University of the Witswatersrand, an LLB and a SAPS training certificate. While we understand that the matter has generated a lot of public interest, Mosola wishes to appeal to the media to afford him reasonable time to mull over the report and make an appropriate decision that accords with the law, Bokaba said.The South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) said it was concerned and disappointed after noting the allegations against Armstrong. She is accused of forging her traffic diploma and SAPS training certificate, which serve as a prerequisite to become a metro police officer. Having noted the said allegations, Samwu will engage both the acting chief of police and the city manager to clarify the said allegations, Samwu regional secretary Mpho Tladinyane said. If it is found that indeed her qualifications are fraudulent, then we will call for her immediate suspension and that necessary disciplinary processes unfold. It cannot be correct that qualified applicants are undermined in favour of those alleged to be unqualified.Members of the Tshwane metro police department are supposed to be fit and proper and beyond reproach, Tladinyane said.NTOMBI NKOSIntombin@thenewage.co.za
