The South African government in its determination to overcome the legacy of inequality and injustice created by colonialism and apartheid has already paid out R19.9bn on acquisition of land for restitution purposes.Land Reform Deputy Minister Mcebisi Skwatsha says the restoration of land to its rightful owners was a fundamental pillar of the liberation struggles over the years. We are determined to overcome the legacy of inequality and injustice created by colonialism and apartheid in a swift, progressive and principled way and to develop a sustainable economy and state infrastructure that will progressively improve the quality of life of all South Africans, Skwatshasaid. According to the Commission on Restitution of Land Rights, 7419 old land claims are yet to be settled while about 80000 land claims were lodged with the commission by December 31, 1998. The settlements have resulted in the award of 3.32 million hectares with 1.9 million hectares having been transferred to beneficiaries and R10.2bn paid as financial compensation.A total of 399116 households, consisting of 1.9 million South Africans, have benefited from the restitution programme. The government has spent R19.9bn on the acquisition of land for restitution purposes.Skwatsha said the government wants to change the lives of ordinary South Africans and is following the path of radical socio-economic transformation. We realised that communities do not always have the necessary tools to deal with challenges they are facing regarding their land. As the government we are in pursuit of an inclusive economy. Our aim is to turn South Africa into a construction site, he said.However, it has since emerged that in some communities there have been squabbles over money with trusts and community property associations accused of mismanagement and corruption.Land and Accountability Research Centre (LARC) senior researcher Brendan Boyle said millions of rands were going into palaces and offshore accounts while communities languished in abject poverty.The LARC assists at least, 150 communities annually and some of the cases have gone as far as the Constitutional Court. A few traditional leaders and elites do deals which are largely to their benefit and subvert the flow of revenue. It s a huge problem across the former homeland areas, Boyle said.MTHOKOZISI DUBEmtokozisid@thenewage.co.za
