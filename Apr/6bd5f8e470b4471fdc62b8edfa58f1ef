Due to continued high demand for its highest performance Pony car, Ford is prolonging the life of the Shelby GT350 and its even more track-focused sibling, the GT350R Mustang, for the 2018 model year.Thanks to a 5.2-liter 526hp turbo-less V8 with a flat-plane crankshaft, the biggest brakes ever fitted to a production Mustang, a MagnaRide damping system and the first carbon fiber wheels ever fitted to a series production vehicle, the GT350 is essentially the most complete Mustang in history, combining all of the best elements of American muscle with the handling composure expected from a European sportscar.&#8220;When we started working on this car, we wanted to build the best possible Mustang for the places we most love to drive &#8212; challenging back roads with a variety of corners and elevation changes, and at the track on weekends,&#8221; said Raj Nair, Ford group vice president, Global Product Development. &#8220;Every change we made to this car was driven by the functional requirements of a powerful, responsive powerplant &#8212; nimble, precise handling and massive stopping power.&#8221;The result is a car that&#8217;s scooped a host of awards over the past 12 months including from Automobile Magazine, Car and Driver &#8212; which voted it to its 2016 10 Best List, and Road &amp; Track, which declared the GT350R its performance car of the year. All of which has helped the Mustang become the world&#8217;s most popular sportscar in 2016.However, thanks to its continued production run, there&#8217;s one accolade the car is in danger of losing.Thanks to its rarity and capability, in January, Kelley Blue Book named the GT350 the high-performance car with the best resale value.Still, even if the car is destined to become a future classic, it would be an act of sacrilege to buy a modern Mustang purely for investment purposes.The 2018 Shelby GT350 and GT350R Mustangs will arrive in dealerships this fall.-Relaxnews
