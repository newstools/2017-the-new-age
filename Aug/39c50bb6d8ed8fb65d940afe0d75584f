THE KZN ANC Youth League has thrown its weight behind Edward Zuma saying he has the right to freedom of speech and was not speaking on behalf of the ANC when he cornered axed finance minister Pravin Gordhan at the Gandhi Memorial Lecture in Pietermaritzburg on Friday.There Zuma called Gordhan a liar and a disgrace to the ANC . Zuma has been relentless in his criticism of Gordhan as he had in an open letter previously called Gordhan a stooge of white monopoly capital . Pravin is a liar, he has stolen people s monies in this country. He has shares in almost everything you can think of in this country and yet he is able to tell lies to people. He must not be allowed to continue telling lies to people. The ANC should deal with him, Zuma said. You sold the country to the white men in Stellenbosch. Tell people that you sold the country to Rupert. You are lying to these people, you are deceiving them, Zuma said.Zuma stood with a group of people holding placards reading, among other things, #Gordhan is a #WMC Puppet and Who has captured you Pravin??? Zuma told The New Age he was uncomfortable with Gordhan speaking at events because he benefits from speaking engagements where he lies . Gordhan goes around the country telling people lies about the ANC and its leaders, using state money, my comments were appropriate and I won t face ANC disciplinary action. That was not an ANC event and I was not there as an ANC member, the president s son said.Zuma further said even when he apologised for the open letter, he was apologising to the ANC and not Gordhan.The KZN ANCYL said: If Gordhan can go around slandering the ANC, what stops us from defending the movement? Why must different rules apply for Pravin Gordhan? If he continues in his tirade he will find us ready for him. news@thenewage.co.za
