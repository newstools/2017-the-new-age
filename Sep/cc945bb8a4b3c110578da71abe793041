A man is in court for possession of child pornography and for failing to report knowledge of the commission of the sexual offence with children.The 26-year-old pastor, employed by a church in Rondebosch, Western Cape, was arrested by the South African Police Service s Serial and Electronic Crimes Investigation (SECI) section of the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences (FCS) Unit.This comes after the parents of an alleged 14-year-old victim reported the case to the police on 31 August 2017.During the arrest, police seized several electronic items that include cell phones, laptop, tablet and memory cards, which will be sent for analysis.Additional charges will probably be added at a later stage as the investigation progresses as it is suspected that as many as 60 children may have fallen victim to this suspect.-TNA Reporter &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
