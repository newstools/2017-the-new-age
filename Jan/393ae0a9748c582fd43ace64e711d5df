Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has promised that his team will not hold back when they visit Atletico Madrid for the first leg of their King&#8217;s Cup semi-final on Wednesday.&#8220;I expect a very complicated tie,&#8221; he told a news conference on Tuesday. &#8220;They have always caused us problems. We have very clear what our aim is. We want to win our first game.&#8221;He expected the usual battle of wits with his Atletico counterpart Diego Simeone.&#8220;I don&#8217;t think Simeone or I will change our style,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They are a difficult rival for us just as we are for them.&#8221;Barca are still without injured midfielders Andres Iniesta and Sergio Busquets who are also set to miss next week&#8217;s return leg.&#8220;Throughout the season, you have to overcome the absence of important players,&#8221; Luis Enrique said. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to make rotations in the games that I can.&#8221;-Reuters
