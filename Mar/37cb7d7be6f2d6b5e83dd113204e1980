It takes a real man to own up to his mistakes and Stanley Menzo did exactly that after Ajax Cape Town were knocked out of the Nedbank Cup last 32 by minnows KwaDukuza United in Durban at the weekend.The Ajax coach stuck to his promise prior the match to give fringe players a run and the move backfired as his side were taught a lesson by the ABC Motsepe League team. Facing the media after the game, Menzo put on a brave face and admitted to have dug his own grave. A win, he said, would have served as a morale booster for his side that last won a match in December ahead of the gruelling PSL programme. I don t want to blame one person, I don t want to blame players. I blame myself and everyone who was here, because we all disappointed our fans and the club, Menzo said. The Ajax coach seemed to underestimated the opponents from the sugar mining town by leaving experienced striker Nathan Paulse, midfielder Bantu Mzwakali, defender Abel Mabaso and striker Lebohang Mokoena on the bench.By the time Paulse, Mabaso and Mzwakali were introduced late in the game, KwaDukuza had grown in confidence and threatened with a few scoring chances. Also missing in action were Bafana Bafana defender Rivaldo Coetze and enterprising midfielder Mark Mayambela. Menzo said Coetze picked up an injury two days before the match but could not give clarity on Mayambela s absence.The Urban Warriors will now solely focus their attention on trying to pull away from teams in the relegation zone as they lie 12th on the PSL table, four points clear of Highlands Park who are second from bottom. They host third from bottom Free State Stars at the Athlone Stadium on Friday.-Linda Ximba|news@thenewage.co.za
