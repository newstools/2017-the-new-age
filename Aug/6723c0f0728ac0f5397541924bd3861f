THE ANC Youth League in the Western Cape has urged President Jacob Zuma to fire Deputy Minister of Higher Education Mduduzi Manana and called on the party’s Integrity Commission to investigate him. The provincial ANCYL chairperson Muhammad Sayed yesterday said its stance on Manana was a united one. “We are not going to allow people to trivialise the abuse of women. The issue is violence against women,” he said. Manana had admitted to assaulting a woman at Cubana nightclub in Fourways last weekend. “He brutally assaulted the woman. He has been responsible for violence against women. Through his action he undermines what we stand for as the ANC and as a country.” Apparently Manana, who has issued a public apology for his conduct, was called a gay before the alleged assault. “We are not impressed with his apology because his behaviour provokes homophobia. As he is supposed to lead young people,” Sayed said. He said the ANCYL found Manana’s behaviour disgusting and disappointing because he is a former national executive member of the organisation. “Therefore we are calling on President Zuma to remove Manana. We also want the ANC Integrity Commission to do its work. Manana has made an admission of guilt therefore the commission should have met immediately and recommended his suspension to the Disciplinary Committee.” Sayed said the ANCYL was confident that President Zuma would act appropriately. “We have not heard from the president. We are giving him space because we have confidence in him.” Manana appeared in Randburg Magistrate’s Court last week. He was released on R5000 bail. He is due to reappear in court on September 13.
