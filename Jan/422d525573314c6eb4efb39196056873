Parents are still clamouring for private schools although class and boarding fees are quite steep.They cite better performance rates and smaller class sizes which make it easier for teachers to attend to the needs of each and every pupil.The number of private schools has been rising steadily in South Africa over the past decades while public schools, especially in the black townships, have shrunk in size because of migration to the formerly white, coloured and Indian suburban schools.The parents who send their children to private schools are also adamant that non-government schools deliver a better quality education than state schools.They are also emphatic that their priority lies in providing their children with a school that is in a good condition, has a good reputation, especially when it comes to pass rates and accountability.Nompucuko Maage, a parent who takes her son to Jacaranda College says her son s performance improved after she enrolled him at the private school. The foundation is different. I sent my son to a public school and I felt my son wasn t learning much. I then sent my child to a private school and his performance was better. The teachers pay more attention to the foundation education, Maage said.Another parent, Collete Makondo says she will remove her child from her area into a private school because she is concerned about drug abuse in her neighbourhood. I will be taking my child to a private high school because most high schools around my residential area are affected by drugs. The children are taking drugs.
