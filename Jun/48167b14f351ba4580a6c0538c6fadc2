The city of Cape Town has marked the start of work on the Ravensmead Park Incremental Development Area with a sod-turning ceremony to address the need for housing.The city said the establishment of an Incremental Development Area (IDA) would provide much relief to the residents of the Ravensmead Park informal settlement as a total of 51 housing opportunities would be created.The upgrade project was allowing for formalised roads and an internal water supply network, including erf connections and internal sewers in the settlement. The Ravensmead Park IDA project is in line with our commitment to improving the lives of our residents by incrementally formalising settlements and focusing on large-scale developments with full amenities and opportunities overtime, the city s mayoral committee member for informal settlements, water and waste services and energy, Xanthea Limberg, said. The city s informal settlements department is truly excited to now be able to implement our plans for this area as IDAs in general are a relatively new concept for the city. The establishment of the IDA was in line with the city s organisational development transformation plan which focused on ensuring greater parity of services for all the people of Cape Town, with one of the priorities being the mainstreaming of basic service delivery to informal settlements.About 38 families lived in Ravensmead Park but through the IDA project the city aimed to yield 51 housing opportunities with the available space and the planned densification of the area to be developed. The Ravensmead Park IDA will surely restore dignity to the families and residents who live there as the various upgrades will improve their living conditions vastly and provide services and infrastructure they have never had access to before, the city s mayoral committee member for area central Siyabulela Mamkeli said. The city s new area-based approach allows us to hone in on various areas within the central region to identify the very unique needs of each informal settlement. The city also said due to population growth, they would share the remaining opportunities to accommodate more families. Due to the growth of the families within the settlement, many of the households now have adult children with their own families, Limberg said. The remaining opportunities will be split among the households with the greater requirement for additional accommodation. The city will ensure that some of the remaining housing opportunities created accommodate some of the disabled and visually impaired residents from Ravensmead Park. Apart from the road infrastructure and housing opportunities planned for each erven within the site, the residents of Ravensmead Park would also benefit from the civil engineering services which would be provided to the area. These services include roads and storm water infrastructure as the area will now tie into the existing storm water network, an internal water supply and internal sewers, Limberg said.Residents have been reminded that only those who qualified in accordance with the subsidised housing criteria would be eligible for a future top structure.Residents had to earn less than R3500 for their households to qualify for a government-subsidised house and must not have owned a house previously.Non-qualifiers would not be eligible for a future top structure but would still receive a site and service or a serviced structure.NADINE FORD-KRITZINGERnadinef@thenewage.co.za
