The North West ANC PEC has dismissed claims made by an unidentified man who appeared on Special Assignment show on SABC 3 making that he was promised money by Provincial leadership. ANC Provincial Secretary Dakota Legoete said that the man who made the claims is still not known to the ANC. “We view these allegations in a serious light and want to urge this person not to hide, but to rather come out and present his story to the ANC instead of the media. “His decision to run to the media instead of reporting this to the ANC and/or law enforcement agencies make it look like he was forced to make these unsubstantiated and unfounded claims,” Legoete said. The man indicated that Provincial Chairperson Supra Mahumapelo, Deputy Provincial Chairperson Sello Lehari and Provincial Secretary Dakota Legoete tried to bribe him by promising him R100 000 to change his support and allegiance from ANC Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to ANC NEC member Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma. “We want to categorically denounce this cheap political ploy by this faceless person, whose intention is clearly to taint the image of our provincial leadership with his lame tactics, which to us are a pure fallacy and grandstanding to imply that our leadership is bad with no morals,” he said. Legoete also urged members of the ANC to remain calm and focused on the upcoming 54th
National Conference instead of having their attention diverted by such claims. -TNA Reporter
