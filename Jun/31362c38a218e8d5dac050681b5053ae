The Constitutional Court ruling in their favour would will give National Assembly power to fire unethical leaders, United Democratic Movement (UDM) Bantu Holomisa said today. Should today s Constitutional Court judgment be in his favour, it will give Parliament the authority to be able to fire questionable presidents, Holomisa said.The Constitutional Court will today give out judgement on whether Parliament should conduct a secret ballot in the no-confidence motion against President Jacob Zuma.Last month legal teams and opposition parties argued that lodged an application led by the UDM to determine whether a no-confidence motion in President Jacob Zuma could be held by secret ballot.Democratic Alliance James Selfe said they hoped the court would find that the speaker had discretion to allow the secret ballot, because in principle the people were elected to represent the voters. We hope the court will find that the speaker has discretion in calling for a secret ballot. Because we believe that it is the right outcome, in principle people are elected to represent the voters and the voters have a right to know how they are represented, selfe said.However, the National Speaker Baleka Mbete had initially argued that it was not within her powers to grant a request for a secret ballot, as the Constitution did not specifically require this.Opposition parties want MPs to vote with their conscience in the vote of no-confidence against the president, believing that that ruling party would vote against Zuma if the secret ballot was held in secret.-Sipho Jack
