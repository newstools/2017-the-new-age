NURSES will this week take part in a national march aimed at highlighting their plight.The Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa (Denosa) has called on nurses to march against bad working conditions, long queues in healthcare facilities and poor healthcare services among others.Workers will also take to the streets in honour of a nurse who collapsed and later died in a queue at the South African Nursing Council s only office in Pretoria.The incident has been met with outrage by those who have long called for the decentralisation of the SANC office.The march is also aimed to highlight the issue of security and the killing and attack of nurses while on duty. We call on nurses to join the march in honour of all the nurses who died in the line of duty. The nurse murdered in Limpopo by a patient, the nurses attacked by the community in Tembisa and all other health facilities in the country, Denosa said.It previously reacted with anger following the death of a Limpopo nurse at the hands of a psychiatric patient, threatening to take serious action should another nurse be attacked while on duty.The nurse, 52, was strangled and killed by a mentally ill patient earlier last year at Hayani Psychiatric Hospital near Thohoyandou.Two female nurses were also attacked at Tembisa Hospital by family members of a patient at the facility in 2015.The union has on numerous occasions called for security measures to be put into place at healthcare facilities.Both nurses and South Africans who are tired of poor healthcare and long queues have been called to join the march. It is in the interest of all nurses to join hands to show the government that we are not happy with the status quo, the union said.The national march comes after Denosa in Gauteng postponed its planned provincial march to the Gauteng department of health and the Government Employees Medical Scheme over fee hikes and what they say is poor service by the scheme.-LERATO DIALE
