A reading revolution is taking over South African primary schools through the Story Powered Schools initiative spearheaded by the national reading for enjoyment campaign, Nal ibali, that believes inculcating a love for reading in every child can positively impact their academic success.Nal ibali, which is a IsiXhosa phrase that translates to Here is a story , has partnered with the US Agency for International Development to bring the campaign s proven approach to literacy development to 720 rural schools in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal provinces.The Nal ibali campaign is built on the logic that a well-established culture of reading can be a real game-changer for education in the country. Indeed, research has shown a direct link between reading for pleasure and children s school success. We ve seen evidence of this in the 1120 reading clubs we work with across the country and are excited to be putting stories into the hearts of the classrooms that need them most, Nal ibali managing director Jade Jacobsohn said.Research indicates that the majority of South African children are not reading well and close to one third of children lack the literacy skills needed for daily living and school learning. With most of these children living in rural areas, Jacobsohn says the Story Powered Schools drive will not only show these children new ways to experience books and stories, but demonstrate to educators how motivation and linking language to children s real-life experiences through reading for pleasure can assist in language development. It helps teachers bring to life stories in a way that supports their curriculum and also helps them to use the often unused reading period. We ll have story sparkers who are going to be working at schools and train teachers and volunteers and other reading champions who are interested in helping children to run reading clubs and competitions, she said.Endorsed by the Department of Education and embedded in the broader Nal ibali campaign, the project will work with the chosen primary schools over a three-year period. Through special training, regular site visits as well as the provision of books and other literacy materials in home languages as well as English, school staff and community volunteers will be supported in bringing the compulsory reading period and literacy time included in the curriculum in grade R to grade 4 classrooms.Broadening the project s reach, these adults will be helped in establishing after-school reading clubs to allow children from other grades to enjoy reading and reap these benefits. Additionally, schools and their surrounding communities will be encouraged to participate in special literacy events and competitions run by the Story Powered Schools drive and supported by Nal ibali at national and provincial levels each year.NOKUTHULA NTULInokuthulan@thenewage.co.za
