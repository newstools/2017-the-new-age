The DA investigation into one of its most high profile female leaders in the Western Cape, Patricia de Lille, is complete.Cape Town mayor De Lille has been investigated for allegedly leaking party documents. Party members close to her, such as Shaun August, the DA chief whip in the city of Cape Town, are also being probed.The head of the DA federal legal commission, Glynnis Breytenbach, yesterday confirmed she had completed her investigation, adding all that remained was to write the report.De Lille unexpectedly resigned at the end of January as leader of the DA in the Western Cape.At the time, she said that she wanted to concentrate on her role as mayor.The investigation into her, which was done parallel to the one against Western Cape Premier Helen Zille for her pro-colonialism tweets, meant that the two most visible females in the DA leadership hierarchy in the province were being probed.Zille s sanctions were announced last week. She has been barred from speaking on DA matters or attending official party events but has been allowed to remain as Premier.Any move against De Lille will depend on the contents of Breytenbach s report.TNA REPORTERnews@thenewage.co.za
