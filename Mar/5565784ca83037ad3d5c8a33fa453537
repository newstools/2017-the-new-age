Classes have resumed at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University(NMMU) after students were evacuated from residences due to a veld fire. The university said the veld fire which affected some of its campuses has been brought under control. NMMU spokesperson Zandile Mbalela: &#8220;following a risk assessment made on North, South and Ocean sciences campuses, it was deemed safe to proceed with lectures so as to minimise impact on the academic programme.&#8221; &#8220;Lectures are advised to be considerate of those who may not be able to attend, in particular the residence students who were subject to evacuations in the early hours of this morning,&#8221; said Mbalela. The university said the massive fire led to the evacuation of dozens of students staying at Sanlam Village on Tuesday night with large tracts of bush veld destroyed on the university&#8217;s South and North Cumpuses. &#8220;Lectures will make alternative arrangement regarding extended deadlines for assignments that were due today(Wednesday) and will provide make up opportunities for tests that were due to be written as well as all other academic work that was missed today,&#8221; said Mbalela. It is believed that the fire started around midnight on the piece of land along side the nature reserve running along the boundary line and into the South Campus. The University said the firefighters will continue to monitor the situation and are attending to any outbursts. &#8220;Investigation as to the root cause of the fire are underway and the university will be liaising with the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality on improving fire breaks and other preventative measures,&#8221; Mbalela said.
