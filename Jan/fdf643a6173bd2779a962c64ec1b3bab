Pupils of pupils at the newly opened Vezirhono Secondary School in Sun City AA near KwaMhlanga have accused the provincial department of education of abusing their children s rights.The parents said the school had a shortage of desks and the situation compelled the pupils to carry their own chairs to class.Those who could not bring along their own chairs would have to access lessons while sitting on the floor and standing.When The New Age visited the school on Tuesday, the classrooms had a few old desks seemingly sourced from the nearby schools.Others had to write and read while placing books on their laps. One desk was being shared by either three pupils or more instead of two.One of the parents, Joyce Matlala, told The New Age although they appreciated their dream to have the first school in the village, which was established in 2006 eventually became a reality, the education authorities should have made all the resources available before allowing the school to function. As parents, we are disappointed about the manner in which our children s rights to access education are being abused by the school, because they need to carry their own chairs from home as the new school has limited desks.Desks are part of the needed resources before a school can function, Matlala said.Another parent, Vusi Mahlangu, said: We feel that such a poor situation will deny our children an opportunity to put necessary concentration on their studies.Imagine a pupil receiving lessons sitting on the floor and leaning against the wall.We demand responses from the education authorities. Acting school principal Fana Motla said he was pleased about the manner in which the school was progressing despite some challenges such as a shortage of staff. He referred further enquiries to education MEC Reginah Mhaule s office.Mhaule s spokesperson Jasper Zwane said they were working towards addressing the lack of necessary resources at the school. We are fully aware of the shortage of resources like desks at the new school. The situation was caused by the parents who did not register their children on time and then spoiled our planning according to the number of pupils we already had. We have already requested the school to compile a detailed report about their needs so that we can attend to them as soon as possible, Zwane said.FRANCE NYAKAfrancen@thenewage.co.za
