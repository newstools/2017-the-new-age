Despite Raven Klaasen and Ruan Roelofse helping South Africa to clinch victory in the Davis Cup tie over Estonia, Klaasen believes the Estonians made it difficult for them on the court.SA won the tie after taking a 3-0 lead following the victory by Roelofse and Klaasen in the doubles on Saturday at the Irene Country Club in Pretoria.SA won the first round 4-1 and will play the winner of the tie between Slovenia and Monaco.The pair defeated Kenneth Raisma and Mattias Siimar 6-7(4) 6-3 6-4 7-5 after the Estonians had a powerful start and won the first set.SA went into the second day of the tie leading 2-0 after Nick Scholtz and Lloyd Harris both won their singles rubbers.Scholtz was leading J rgen Zopp 4-6 6-4 6-3 before the Estonian fell to the ground with an abdominal injury and was forced to retire from after 2 hours and 11 minutes of play. In the second singles rubber Harris impressively beat Vladimir Ivanov 6-4 6-3 6-2 in 1 hour and 56 minutes.The country s top-ranked doubles player and world No 13, Klaasen, didn t expect the youthful Estonian team to be much of a problem for SA. We didn t get off to the start we would have liked and had to come back from a set down, Klaasen said. But that s Davis Cup for you. You never have anything the way you expect, players when playing for their country tend to play better than usual and these Estonian youngsters came out swinging and did themselves proud. Klaasen and Roelofse played together for the fourth time and they are yet to lose as a team.SA team captain Marcos Ondruska echoed Klaasen s words about the performance of the opponents in the doubles tie. That rubber was tougher than we expected. We knew the Estonian youngsters could play good doubles but we really didn t expect them to come out firing like they did and after my boys lost the opening set we had to step up and make the most of all the opportunities thrown, Ondruska said after claiming the victory. Raven and Ruan did just that and capitalised on their experience which resulted in them winning the next three sets to clinch the rubber and tie. SITHEMBISO DINDIsithembisod@thenewage.co.za
