Samsung has accidentally leaked an image of its upcoming Samsung Galaxy Note 8 after weeks of rumours. The flagship, which is set to be the company s biggest comeback after the tragic failure of the Galaxy Note 7, is set to launch in August.Even Ice Universe, one of the Twitter users who got the Galaxy S8 design in February, correctly issued a matter of fact tweet confirming that yes, this is the Note 8 . Tech giant Samsung Electronics used its official Twitter account for its Exynos chipsets tweeting a promotion for the Exynos 8895 the chipset used in the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus giving us a good look at the new smartphone with an Infinity display.As much as the flagship matches up almost exactly with the recently leaked features, the angle of the handset Samsung shown does not address the most important aspect on whether the fingerprint sensor will be integrated into the bottom of the display or not. Forbes said three Foxconn employees confirmed the following features. It looks most like the middle version in both leaked images. There is a new dual rear camera with vertical alignment. The front bezel will be thinner on the Y-axis.Test units have Touch ID under the glass but performance and yield rates were not good . No version is planned with a rear fingerprint scanner. AuthenTech s long-standing Touch ID capacitive touch module has been replaced. There will be facial detection and a retina scanner and plural front facing camera modules . RAM remains at 3GB like the iPhone 7 Plus. The aluminium unibody is replaced by composite glass .There s wireless charging via a rear panel. It will again be water resistant (no word if the rating has increased). There is no USB-C, Apple is sticking with Lightning. Production is indeed delayed. -INDIE BOYCE|indiphileb@thenewage.co.za
