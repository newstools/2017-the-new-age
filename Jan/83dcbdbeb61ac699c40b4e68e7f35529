Mayor of Ngwathe Local Municipality in the Northern Free State Joey Mochela has on Thursday encouraged all residents to pay municipality services, especially those who were not on the indigent policy.The mayor s plea follows Eskom s planned power interruptions across the country targeting all municipalities that owned monies to the power utility.Municipality s spokesperson Steve Naale said even though the municipality was not included in the Eskom s power interruptions that does not mean the municipality doesn&#8217;t owe Eskom.Naale said the municipality was currently implementing strict conditions against people who are using electricity illegally, whom were putting the lives of innocent people at risk under the municipality s Operation Tsipolla. The operation includes electricity meter auditing while verifying payment of municipal services, we started with businesses before moving to residential sites.&#8220;Most of the findings, were unbelievable in a terrible manner, during the visit to these outlets, including physiotherapists, restaurants, liquor stores, furniture shops even residential sites of owners of some of these stores. We discovered that they have been stealing electricity deliberately.He added that during the raids officials managed to record confessions of people who were supplying residents and business owners with illegal electricity.Ngwathe municipality is one of the smallest municipalities under Fezile Dabi District Municipality, which falls under category B. The municipality has a total population of about 120520 of which 86% of it are black African and 10,3% of it are white people. Majority of the residents in the area are unemployed.Acting Municipal Manager Pule Tsekedi told the New Age that he was disappointed by the number of individuals, who were constantly complaining about the Eskom electricity situation but they did not purchase electricity from the municipality outlets but they instead purchased from these illegal runners.The municipal manager further said the culprits failed to provide evidence of purchase for their unlimited units on meter boxes while there was no record of purchase in the municipal system. One of the stores was found with illegal electricity to the value of R32 000 and the units were written off immediately.&#8221;The municipal revenue exceeded R233 000 within twenty four hours of the implementation of the operation, while the finance department was still receiving payments from 231 defaulters, in Parys only.Naale also eluded that most of the estate properties and apartments had also not been buying electricity from the municipality for years and that their electricity meters were tampered with as well.He said some of the business owners who were caught, resorted to threatening officials by name dropping names of the politicians.-Sipho Jack
