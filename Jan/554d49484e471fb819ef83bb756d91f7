Gauteng is expected to reap significant benefits from the ANC s 105th anniversary celebration at Orlando stadium in Soweto on Sunday, particularly from a tourism perspective, Throngs of ANC supporters from across the country are expected to descend on the city and hotels, restaurants, tourism attractions, hawkers and entertainment venues will benefit from the financial injection. Coming at the close of the festive season, this event will provide an additional welcome visitor windfall, Gauteng Tourism Authority CEO Siphiwe Ngwenya said. The event will yield long-term spinoffs for Soweto in particular and the province in general. Ngwenya says Gauteng leverages such events to promote the province as a must-see, big city region. Event tourism anchors our strategy of attracting visitors to the golden city region and we are hopeful this celebration will make a singular contribution to our efforts. He said that the main event takes place at the Orlando stadium and links up with the provincial administration s drive to prioritise the development of township economies. Soweto is steeped in a rich heritage that offers the world-famous Vilakazi Street, the Hector Pieterson Memorial and Museum, Regina Mundi Catholic Church, Walter Sisulu Square in Kliptown and the popular Soweto Towers for a bungee jump or quad bike experience. We urge those at the celebrations to make it a weekend experience that could possibly include a visit to Maropeng at the Cradle of Humankind world heritage site among many other tourism gems Gauteng has to offer, Ngwenya said.
