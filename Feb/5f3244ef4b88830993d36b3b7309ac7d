THE owner of a hotel in Oudtshoorn has been arrested for theft and discharging a firearm within a municipal area in full view of the public during an argument with a customer. The 69-year-old suspect was arrested by members of the public order police on Sunday after he allegedly discharged a firearm during an argument over car keys with Southern Cape Land Committee (SCLIC) staff member Ricardo Betsha. Police said the suspect was detained at the Oudtshoorn police holding cells on Sunday. The non-governmental organisation that works to advance land, agrarian, justice and transformation, hosted a two-day workshop on labour rights for 70 farm workers when the incident occurred. According to eyewitnesses the argument came after the hotel owner reportedly confiscated Betsha s car keys saying that he was disturbed by loud music coming from his vehicle. We are disturbed by what happened and deserve to be treated with respect, an eyewitness said. It is sad that we have to witness this kind of incident in a country that is making so much effort for some people to change. We believe the police and justice will not fail us when it comes to dealing with the case. Southern Cape police spokesperson Capt Malcolm Pojie confirmed the incident and said the suspect was arrested at his place of residence on Sunday and appeared in the Oudtshoorn Magistrate s Court on Tuesday. It is alleged that the suspect threatened and refused to return the complainant s car keys he had in his possession the previous night. The complainant requested members of the Oudtshoorn police to accompany him to fetch his car keys, but the suspect refused to return the keys and allegedly discharged a firearm into the ground. No one was injured. The suspect was then arrested, he said. The SCLIC condemned the action by the suspect and called on the police and justice system to deal with the offender accordingly.
