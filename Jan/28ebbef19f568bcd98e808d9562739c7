SIPHELELE Mthembu s hopes of rejuvenating his fast waning career were severely dashed when Bloemfontein Celtic decided against signing him.The 29-year-old striker was hoping to rejoin Celtic on loan from Kaizer Chiefs after enduring two unproductive seasons at Naturena.He fell down the pecking order and was subsequently sent to the MultiChoice Diski Challenge squad to get some game time under the tutelage of Arthur Zwane.After featuring in the friendly against Lesotho, Celtic co-head coach John Maduka revealed Mthembu was not what they were looking for and was similar to the strikers they already have on their books. After the Lesotho game we let him go despite doing well. The problem is that he is similar to the strikers we have. Remember we have Atusaye Nyondo, Ayanda Dlamini, Fiston Abdul Razak and Moeketsi Mvula. And if you look at all those players you can see they are similar to him. We were looking for something different, Maduka said.The Mangaung side are now searching for a striker before the window closes on Tuesday.Elsewhere, unsettled Chiefs midfielder Enocent Mkhabela looks set to rejoin Platinum Stars on loan.Mkhabela has struggled to break into the starting line-up since his move from SuperSport United before the start of the season.LINDA XIMBAnews@thenewage.co.za
