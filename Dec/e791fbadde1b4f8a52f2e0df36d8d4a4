Limpopo police have called on parents and child minders to exercise maximum caution and to always know what their children are up to, at all times. The call comes after a child drowned and another disappeared in the province. Provincial police spokesperson Moatshe Ngoepe said in the first case, a two-year-old went missing while walking with her sister and parents, who were intoxicated, in Witpoort outside Lephalale. “The couple decided to rest under a tree and subsequently they fell asleep. When they woke up at around 7pm, they found that the two-year-old child was missing,” Ngoepe said. Ngoepe said the couple then alerted the police, who launched a manhunt. So far, he said, the toddler has not been found. Anyone with information about the child’s whereabouts can contact the police on 0860010111 or SMS 32211. In the second case, the police have launched an inquest investigation after a child drowned in a swimming pool in the Senwamokgope township on Saturday. Ngwepe said it is alleged that eight-year-old Tsholofelo Lekukela from Ga-Mohokong village in Bolobedu outside Tzaneen was on a crèche tour when she drowned. Ngwepe said no foul play is suspected and investigations are continuing. -TNA Reporter
