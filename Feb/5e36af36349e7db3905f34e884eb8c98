 Never let the truth get in the way of good speculation. This is what SuperSport United coach Stuart Baxter has said about widespread speculation doing the rounds about his apparent imminent return to Bafana Bafana.The Briton, who is a former Bafana coach, is one of the candidates in the running to replace former Bafana coach Shakes Mashaba. With Safa looking for a coach who will hit the ground running with the Africa Cup of Nations and World Cup qualifiers this year, Baxter s knowledge of Bafana makes him one of the best candidates together with Carlos Queiroz, Pitso Mosimane, Ruud Krol and Gavin Hunt. I m not too fazed by that, to be honest.There is always speculation all the time, Baxter said. I ve had a story this week from a colleague in England that says, in one of the papers, I will be succeeding Carlos Queiroz in Iran. That s far from my thoughts but it s there. So I don t know, I think people say things that may be taken and blown out a little bit, but I m not too fazed about it because it s just part of our game. It also helps you guys write your articles and speculate a little bit. There was a journalist in England, he said to me never let the truth get in the way of good speculation . I don t want to fuel that speculation. I would say, I have been a national team coach and a club coach.There are attractions to both jobs but when you are the national coach it s an honour no matter where you are, Baxter said. When I was in Finland, I was honoured to be the Finnish national coach. -NevIlle Khoza|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
