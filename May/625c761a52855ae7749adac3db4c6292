Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka on Friday reversed his decision to resign, saying he would instead seek the removal of Finance Minister Andrej Babis, his main political rival, to end a dispute in his centre-left government.Earlier this week Sobotka had said he would resign along with the whole government.He changed his mind after President Milos Zeman indicated he would treat the resignation as Sobotka&#8217;s own, not the departure of the entire cabinet, a stance that would leave Babis in his post.-Reuters
