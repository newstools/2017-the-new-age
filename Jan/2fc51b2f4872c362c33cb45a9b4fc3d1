STRUGGLING Orlando Pirates will have their work cut out when they resume their league fixtures next month. The Buccaneers, who had a dismal performance towards the end of last year following back-to-back defeats to Maritzburg United and Bloemfontein Celtic, will resume their campaign with a daunting fixture against Bidvest Wits on February 3. In fact, February will test the coachless Pirates as they will play Wits twice in the space of 12 days after their firstround match was postponed last year due to the Fees Must Fall campaign.In between, there is also a tough fixture against CAF Champions League champions Mamelodi Sundowns on February 11 at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria. In the past seasons, Pirates have struggled to beat Sundowns and Wits and if their performance towards the end of last year is anything to go by, they will be lucky to come out with three points, or even one.Pirates will also play Platinum Stars, Cape Town City and Polokwane City to complete their six matches for the month of February. The tricky streak bleeds over into March, with the Buccaneers scheduled to play Soweto rivals Kaizer Chiefs on March 4, followed by an encounter with hoodoo team SuperSport United three days later. Meanwhile, the PSL also released an amended fixture list for the remainder of the season, which will end on June 24 with the Nedbank Cup final.This is because the season started late due to the Rio Olympics in August as well as Mamelodi Sundowns going all the way to the final of the Champions League and participating in the Fifa Club World Cup in Japan. The fixtures also accommodate the four South African clubs taking part in the continental competitions this year. Sundowns and Wits will represent the country at the Champions League, while SuperSport United and Platinum Stars will take part in the CAF Confederation Cup.-Neville Khoza
