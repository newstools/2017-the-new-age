Defense arguments in the corruption trial of Brazil&#8217;s firebrand ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will close June 20, the judge said Monday.Based on previous cases handled by the judge, Sergio Moro, that could mean a verdict being announced three to 15 days later. However, Moro did not give any further indication.Lula is accused of receiving a seaside apartment as a bribe for helping the OAS construction company during his 2003-2010 presidency to get lucrative deals with state oil firm Petrobras.Moro, who heads a huge graft probe called &#8220;Operation Car Wash&#8221; in the southern city of Curitiba, said in a court document that prosecutors would have between May 25 to June 2 for their closing arguments. The defense would have from June 7 to 20.If Lula is found guilty and loses his appeal, he would be barred from seeking a comeback in the October 2018 presidential elections and could be jailed. The leftist leader currently leads in opinion polls, although he is deeply unpopular on the right.Lula, 71, underwent nearly five hours of questioning in Curitiba last week and says he is the victim of a political witch hunt. He faces four other corruption trials, all of which could derail his election bid if he is convicted and fails in his appeals.-AFP
