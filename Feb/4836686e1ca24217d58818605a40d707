Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir has ordered the release of a Czech Christian aid worker sentenced to 24 years in jail on charges of spying and inciting hatred, a minister said Sunday.Petr Jasek, 53, was arrested in December 2015 and a court sentenced him last month.Jasek, a member of a small Protestant Czech church called Cirkev Bratrska, had travelled to Sudan to help local Christians, according to Czech media reports.Sudanese authorities said he had entered the country &#8220;illegally&#8221; from neighbouring South Sudan and gone to the conflict-riven state of South Kordofan.In January, a court found him guilty of entering Sudan without a visa, spying, taking pictures of military installations and inciting hatred, according to his lawyer.But Foreign Minister Ibrahim Ghandour announced on Sunday at a joint press conference with his visiting Czech counterpart Lubomir Zaoralek that Bashir had ordered Jasek&#8217;s release.&#8220;President Bashir has pardoned Czech national Petr Jasek because of good relations between Sudan and the Czech Republic,&#8221; Ghandour said, adding that Jasek was to be handed over to Zaoralek later on Sunday.&#8220;Mr Jasek will accompany the Czech foreign minister to his homeland,&#8221; Ghandour said.Zaoralek flew in to Khartoum earlier Sunday to press for Jasek&#8217;s release.&#8220;I am very glad that we are able today to conclude the case of Mr Jasek,&#8221; said Zaoralek, speaking in English.He said that Khartoum was convinced that Jasek &#8220;had no intention to undermine&#8221; Sudan.Release International, a group which says its mission is to helps persecuted Christians worldwide, said Jasek and three Sudanese men were detained after helping to finance the medical treatment of a student from the conflict-hit region of Darfur who had suffered burns during a rally.-AFP
