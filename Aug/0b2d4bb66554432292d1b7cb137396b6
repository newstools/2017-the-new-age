The South African Police Union (SAPU) has announced that workers at the 10111 police call centre have resumed their strike with immediate effect.SAPU General Secretary, Oscar Skommere, confirmed the strike saying despite concerted attempts, they had failed to reach a compromise with the South African Police Service (SAPS) management.&#8220;We had hoped to be able to meet the demands of the workers but over the past two weeks we have been struggling with the SAPS management,&#8221; said Skommere.At the heart of the dispute is a demand by workers to be elevated from their current salary level five up to salary level seven.The two parties had previously agreed to suspend the strike for two weeks to allow for negotiations to end the dispute.The union said that following a job evaluation and a study into the matter, it was confirmed that 10111 call centre agents earn less than their counterparts at other call centres for other government institutions like Home Affairs, SARS and SASSA.&#8220;We do not see any willingness on their side moving forward hence workers and the unions were not satisfied with the progress made in the past two weeks and that&#8217;s why we are calling to resume the strike,&#8221; said Skommere.Back In June, the workers marched to the Police Minister, Fikile Mbalula to express their frustrations.&#8211;TNA Reporter
