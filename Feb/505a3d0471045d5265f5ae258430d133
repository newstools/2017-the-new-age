The thugs did not ask for anything, they shot me and three other people. The three of us survived unfortunately one died, he said. I am lucky to survive, this took close to two minutes but it felt like a life-time. They just randomly shot at us. Charles Charlie Makhubela, 35, was the victim who died on the scene. He left behind two siblings and a five-year-old daughter.Makhubela s heartbroken twin brother Eric, yesterday described his sibling as a people s person. He hugged and told me that he loved me just a few minutes before I left him. I told him I loved him back. As I drove away, I heard a gunshot, but I continued since gunshots are a norm here, Makhubela said.Makhubela said the injured survivors including the DJ were taken to Kalafong Hospital in Pretoria.ntombin@thenewage.co.za
