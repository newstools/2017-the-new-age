By Carl NiehausTHE 14th congress of the South African Communist Party (SACP) concludes today. As a member of the national executive committee of MKMVA, I deliberately did not attend. This is in line with our decision not to accept the invitation that we received from the SACP to participate.I have been observing from a distance how the congress is unfolding. But distance is not always a bad thing and can help one to see the wood as well as the trees.I have read the political report that comrade Blade Nzimande presented on Tuesday and watched with growing indifference the live TV broadcast as he ploughed through the report, filled with the usual communist party jargon.I deliberately watched with a couple of young people who by the way are politically active and members of the ANC Youth League because I wanted to gauge their response. Halfway through the speech their indifference outpaced mine and I could see from their remarks that the general secretary had lost them.I could not help but note that some of these young people were born in 1998 when Nzimande was for the first time elected (always unopposed) as general secretary.Nor could I resist a smile when one of my young friends his chatting with a friend interrupted by the volume of the crescendo of indignation about all the wrongs of the Zuma administration that comrade Blade was reaching towards the end of his speech asked about what the comrade had actually done about all these concerns of his, since he has now been a member of the NEC of the ANC for donkey s years and in Cabinet since 2009 as minister of Higher Education? The unasked, but very real question was: If he is so unhappy, why is he staying on?I must say in all the reporting and media commentary that I read since Tuesday I have not encountered a more incisive response. Yes, indeed, why?There is something to be said for the cleareyed straightforwardness of youth. Before I return to my young comrade s questions let me for those who may not have seen the MKMVA media statement about why we stayed away explain why I was sitting on the couch in my living room watching comrade Blade, rather than joining my communist comrades in their deliberations.Within the first few paragraphs of his speech he provided the answer himself when he referred to those (ANC) NEC members, ANC parliamentary caucus (members) veterans, stalwarts and genuine MK veterans , who resist the pathological developments in the ANC.For good measure he emphasised that he wanted to underline genuine MK veterans. So Nzimande, with the dubious meanderings of his political career via the Inkatha Freedom Party and not a single day of training as a liberation soldier or membership of Umkhonto we Sizwe, wants to judge who is a genuine MK veteran?This is arrogance of the worst kind. Nobody could have articulated the problem with the current stance of the SACP better than its general secretary himself. In my mothertongue Afrikaans there is an apt word for this kind of arrogance, it is called beterweterig (roughly translated as a know it all attitude, although the English does not entirely do justice to it).So, according to the general secretary of the party (as they like to refer to themselves) that knows it all , because of their so-called superior analytical capabilities as communists, the ANC leadership under President Zuma is pathological, captured and corrupt. Only those in the ANC who follow the leadership of the party , are worthy.For those who find it hard to believe this kind of arrogance from the SACP of JB Marks, Yusuf Dadoo and Chris Hani, I promise you, I am not making it up, it is right there on page four of the political report but hey, then again, Nzimande cannot by any shot of the imagination be compared with the very genuine MK chief of staff, Chris Hani.I have always believed that arrogance and factionalism go hand in hand. The SACP s political report that Nzimande delivered confirmed this.In this report the SACP holds the yardstick and only they measure who according to them the true genuine revolutionary cadres are. It is that simple: Those who believe and think like they do are revolutionaries and the others who don t are counter-revolutionary riff-raff.There can be nothing more poisonous and destructive for the continuation of the tripartite alliance than this attitude.In our MKMVA statement we pointed out that it is a well-established tradition that alliance partners do not prescribe to each other about internal organisational matters by trying to prescribe who should be its president, or ban the leader of one alliance partner from attending the meetings of another.We also pointed out that it has always been the case that the ANC, as the leader of society, is the leader of the alliance. Thus, by staying away we decided to bring home as strongly as possible that with the prevailing arrogant attitude of the SACP they are endeavouring to place themselves above the ANC.Clearly for the SACP, membership of the party is paramount and more important than their membership of the ANC. With such an approach the dual ANC and SACP membership is being abused.When it suits SACP members to advance their careers to get appointed into positions as MECs and ministers, they emphasise that they are ANC members, but when it does not suit them they are first and foremost SACP members who do not consider themselves to be bound by constitutional organisational structures and discipline of the ANC.It actually goes even further, because when they do not get their way inside the democratic constitutional structures of the ANC, as Jeremy Cronin, the former deputy general secretary alluded, they intend to form alliances with other so-called civil society structures and mobilise for the change they could not democratically achieve as ANC members inside the ANC, outside the ANC.This is a classical case of wanting to have your cake and eat it.The consequence of all this is on display as the congress is in session. Only those ANC members whom the SACP agrees with are given a platform. Zuma was banned from attending, but Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa invited to address the congress. Thus, the SACP now tries to select and literally choose for the ANC.The members of MKMVA as the tried and tested soldiers of our liberation struggle have always been the revolutionary backbone of the ANC. We cannot and will not allow such a situation.We ask ourselves why Nzimande is behaving in this manner and why is he also literally contradicting himself about a critically important matter such as the correct definition of the economic exploitation of the majority of black people (especially Africans), as being carried out by white monopoly capital?Why did Nzimande dedicate a whole page in his political report to remove the word white as the aptly descriptive reference to monopoly capital in South Africa, being white?Why is he repeating the blatant lie that a British PR company called Bell Pottinger coined the term, while he himself had used the very same term in many of his speeches, including his address to Cosatu s congress on September 18, 1997? Why is Nzimande now campaigning against himself?Together with my young ANCYL comrades I ask since comrade Blade has several times repeated in the political report that the SACP considers itself to be the vanguard of the working class what concrete actions has the SACP taken to provide solidarity to workers and their communities and their day-to-day struggles?What is the SACP doing with regards to the #FeesMustFall campaign , the battles for #OutsourcingMustFall and the thousands of service delivery protests?Indeed, why is he still holding (sometimes it seems for dear life) onto his Cabinet post as minister of Higher Education? Is there still possibly a hidden SACP strategy, so deeply disguised that it has become invisible, or is it just simply careerism?So many questions.As I have observed at the beginning of this article, the SACP congress comes to an end today.We in MKMVA will carefully watch to see if real answers are forthcoming. Hopefully resolutions and answers that will demonstrate working class commitment and revolutionary humility, rather than arrogance.It is high time to reposition the SACP to again play the important and constructive role that it used to play in the tripartite alliance and for the party to unambiguously acknowledge the leadership of the ANC.Carl Niehaus is a former member of the NEC of the ANC and an NEC member of the Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association.
