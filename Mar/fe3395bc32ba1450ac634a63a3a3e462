Report every request for video &amp; mute every1 who gleefully encourages the illegal &amp; immoral abuse of children SnoopyBez (@SnoopyBez) March 23, 2017Naidoo stated that a specialised team has been informed of the video that is trending on both Facebook and Twitter.&#8220;Anyone who is in possession of the video and has distributed can face criminal charges. When you receive this video, contact the nearest police station or call CrimeStop on 086 00 1011,&#8221; said Naidoo.He also stated that in the past they have been able to trace the origins of images and videos of child pornography and prosecuted the suspects.According to Doctor Monique Emser from the University of the Free State child porn in South Africa is on the rise.Speaking to SABC, Emser was unpacking some alarming and highly disturbing trends such as baby porn, live video streaming of sexual acts with children, for so-called bespoke material.&#8220;It is estimated that there was a 70% increase in child sexual material focused on girls under the age of 10 with abuse material involving toddlers and babies not being uncommon.We see also a significant number of forums and online channels that openly advertise videos of brutal sexual assault. What s even more valuable and has replaced actual currency is the production of more child abuse material to pay for access,&#8221; said Emser.-Simangele Legodi
