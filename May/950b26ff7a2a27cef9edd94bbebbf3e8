Wits also announced that new fossil remains were found in close proximity to where the first Homo naledi skeletons were found.The new chamber, named Lesedi Chamber yielded a partial skeleton and a wonderfully complete skull which the team has named Neo (the Sesotho word for a gift), John Hawks of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Wits University said.The Lesedi Chamber is described as only slightly easier to get to but more difficult to work in due to its tight spaces.Hawks points out that while the Lesedi Chamber is easier to get into than the Dinaledi Chamber, the term is relative. I have never been inside either of the chambers and never will be. In fact, I watchedLee Berger being stuck for almost an hour, trying to get out of the narrow underground squeeze of the Lesedi Chamber. Berger eventually had to be extracted using ropes tied to his wrists. This adds weight to the hypothesis that Homo naledi was using dark, remote places to cache its dead, says Hawks.More than 52 scientists from 35 departments and institutions were involved in the research.Wits Vice-Chancellor Professor Adam Habib said: The search for human origins on thecontinent of Africa began at Wits and it is wonderful to see this legacy continue with such important discoveries Blob The original fossils of this exciting new discovery, as well as Homo naledi fossils from the first Rising Star Expedition will be put on public display at Maropeng, the Official Visitor Center for the Cradle ofHumankind World Heritage Site from May 25th. This exhibit of the largest display of original fossil hominin material in history, form part of an exhibition called Almost Human.TNA Reporter
