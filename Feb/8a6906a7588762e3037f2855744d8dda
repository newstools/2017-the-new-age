The Department of Environmental Affairs funded programme conducts annual recruitments, KZN general manager Winnie Ndlovu, said. This process assists us to make sure that all the teams are at full strength at all times. In the 30 teams of KZN, Each team has a total of 25 participants, that are physically fit and well trained in terms of integrated fire management activities. WOF has hired 34 new participants and is still recruiting. By the end of February, 51 new recruits will undergo vigorous 25-day training at the training academy in Nelspruit.
