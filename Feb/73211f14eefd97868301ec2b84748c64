German luxury carmaker BMW will recall around 41,500 vehicles in China due to faulty airbags, according to the country&#8217;s quality regulator.Some 3,926 cars produced between January-December 2012, and a second group of 37,759 vehicles produced between January-December 2012 will be recalled, according to a statement posted on the website of China&#8217;s General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (ASDIQ).Gas generators in the defective airbags of the recalled cars could break unexpectedly, creating debris that poses a threat to riders&#8217; safety, ASDIQ said.The company will replace the flawed gas generators in the airbags for free, it said.In December BMW China said they would recall some 220,000 imported BMW and Rolls-Royce vehicles also with flawed airbags.-AFP
