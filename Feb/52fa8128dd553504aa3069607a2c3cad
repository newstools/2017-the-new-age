The Democratic Alliance (DA) is on Friday set to lay formal charges against former Gauteng Health MEC Qedani Mahlangu amid the ongoing fall out over the deaths of 94 mentally ill patients.The move comes after the African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) on Thursday laid corruption and culpable homicide charges against Mahlangu at Johannesburg Central police station.Calls for Mahlangu to face prosecution are the result of a damning report by Health Ombudsman Prof Malegapuru Makgoba which highlighted negligence in the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the 94 mentally ill patients who were moved to unlicensed NGOs.The report found that Mahlangu and her former senior officials decision to relocate more than 1 000 psychiatric patients from Life Healthcare Esidimeni was reckless and negligent.&#8220;The Ombud s Report in numerous instances describes the conduct of the Gauteng Department of Health (GDoH) and by extension the MEC, as negligent,&#8221; said DA Gauteng Shadow MEC for Health Jack Bloom in a statement.&#8220;There can be no doubt that the deaths of the patients are as a direct consequence of that conduct, and that the conduct was not in accordance with the National Health Act, the Mental Health Care Act and the Constitution,&#8221; Bloom said.The DA is also taking Mahlangu to task for having made a false statement regarding the number of deceased patients last year in September.Releasing his report on Wednesday, Makgoba said at least 94 psychiatric patients died between March 23 and December 19 last year in Gauteng as opposed to the 36 deaths the department repeatedly claimed.&#8220;The MEC s false statement in the Legislature on 13 September 2016 in which she said that 36 patients had died whereas the true figure was 77 patients is a prima facie misrepresentation of a fact in a report&#8230;&#8221; said Bloom.Mahlangu has already resigned in the wake of the damning report.&#8220;I have laid these charges as it is important that there are consequences for contraventions of the law by politicians and also because I am not confident that the provincial government will lay similar charges against former MEC Mahlangu,&#8221; said Bloom.The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) on Thursday also laid charges against both Mahlangu and Gauteng Premier David Makhura at the Johannesburg Central police station.-TNA Reporter
