We may have not mentioned white monopoly capital in the strategy and tactic of the African National Congress (ANC), as a document because it s a long term document, says ANC free State chairperson Ace Magashule.Magashule reiterated the existence of white monopoly capital, saying it still exists currently, and that was a reality. White monopoly capital exist, there is no Black monopoly capital. That s why most of the delegates talk about existence of white monopoly capital, Magashule said.However, the party s strategy and tactics head Joel Netshitenze told media that the policy conference has rejected the characterisation of monopoly capital as white monopoly capital but it was rather that the economy is dominated by white dominance.Netshitenze says nine commissions have rejected the idea of white monopoly capital, out of eleven. But he emphasised that the party can t shy away from the radicalised nature of the economy. We cannot run away from the reality of white dominance in the economy in the context of assets and income, he said.But Magashule differed with, the party s strategy and tactics head, saying one cannot talk about Radical Economic Transformation (RET) when there is no existence of white monopoly capital, adding that they decided to adopt the RET because they wanted to address the reality of today. The reality of South Africa today is that the economy of our country is in the hands of the few of which are white people. We are not blaming whites. Is that not reality, Magashule proclaimed.-Sipho Jack
