Siboniso Gaxa believes it is time for Bidvest Wits to shake off their also-ran tag when it comes to winning the Premier Soccer League title.The Clever Boys are yet to win their first league title but are one of the favourites to walk away with the prestigious trophy and a cheque of R10m this season. In past years Wits have been strong contenders for the title only to fail at the end. Last season they finished second to Mamelodi Sundowns.Gaxa has won the league three times with SuperSport United and Kaizer Chiefs and now he aims to be counted among the first players to win it with Wits. The 32-year-old right-back says Wits have been consistently impressive in recent seasons and earning the title this season will be clear proof of that. Wits are second on the log with 38 points from 19 matches, one point behind Cape Town City.However, Wits still have two games in hand as they are also involved in the CAF Confederations Cup. They have been part of the top three in the past couple of years, so it s a great opportunity for the club to now go further, Gaxa said. It s always there for them to win it and I hope this season is going to be a special one for us. We are all wishing for it to come our way. Gaxa earned his first league title in 2008 while at SuperSport and the other two titles came when he was with Amakhosi in 2013 and 2015. As a player who has done it all before, the former Bafana Bafana defender understands it will take more than a wish to realise the club s dream and shake off its also-ran tag.We have to continue working hard, take it one game at a time and make sure that we get positive results. The good thing about Wits is that we give 150% on the field and we will continue to give our all. Wits have already won the MTN8 this season and are still in the Nedbank Cup and play Jomo Cosmos in the last 16. They resume their league campaign by hosting Platinum Stars on Saturday at Bidvest stadium at 6pm.-Sithembiso Dindi|sithembisod@thenewage.co.za
