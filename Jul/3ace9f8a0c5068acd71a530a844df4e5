West Bromwich Albion have signed Jay Rodriguez from Premier League rivals Southampton, the England striker&#8217;s new club confirmed Sunday.The 27-year-old has long been linked with a move to The Hawthorns and West Brom chose an unusual away to confirm the deal.Responding to a tweet from a fan asking if they had signed anyone ahead of the new season, Midlands club Albion replied with a four-second clip of Rodriguez saying &#8220;yes we have&#8221;.Southampton said they had received an undisclosed fee for Rodriguez who made 126 appearances for them after joining from Burnley in 2012.But while his time with the south-coast club saw Rodriguez make his England debut in a friendly against Chile in November 2013, it also saw him sidelined for 11 months with a knee injury that ruled him out of the 2014 World Cup.&#8220;After one or two near misses I&#8217;m absolutely buzzing to be here,&#8221; Rodriguez said.&#8220;The most important thing for any player is to be wanted &#8212; and Tony Pulis and Albion have made it clear just how much they have wanted me to join. That&#8217;s fantastic for any footballer to hear.&#8220;I&#8217;m genuinely delighted to be joining a club of Albion&#8217;s stature. The team is full of top players and it&#8217;s pretty clear that they are also a great set of lads.&#8221;West Brom finished tenth in the Premier League last season, a point and two places behind Southampton.&#8211; AFP
