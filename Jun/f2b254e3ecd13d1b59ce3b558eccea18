The Gauteng education department says teaching has been taking place normally in Winterveldt north of Pretoria after parents last week removed children from a number of schools following an alleged kidnapping spree of pupils.It was reported that students had been abducted within the vicinity of Dr Sam Motswenyane Secondary, Dikgakologo and Tswaing primary schools. This led to parents withdrawing their children from the affected schools.Gauteng education acting spokesperson Oupa Bodibe said they were concerned about rumours of children who get abducted, adding that this was disrupting learning and teaching in schools.&#8220;However, there is no evidence of such activities taking place in our schools,&#8221; Bodibe said.Bodibe said the they have requested that the SAPS verify the reports of the abductions. However, the police were of the view that this was a hoax, and that no such cases have been reported.Last week Gauteng police spokesperson Lieutenant Kay Makhubela said the police had not received any reports of such kidnappings.The department said it cooperated and partnered with the local SAPS and the Tshwane metro police to visibly monitor the area.&#8220;We would also like to urge parents and educators to always caution learners not to use unknown transport offered to them by strangers,&#8221; Bodibe said.The department has appealed to the members of the community to help the police to arrest the suspects.-TNA Reporter
