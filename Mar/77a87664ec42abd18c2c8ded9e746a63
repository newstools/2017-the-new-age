Although the threat of life-threatening diseases is always real, a global infectious disease threat is tuberculosis (TB). This has been the case for centuries and for the foreseeable future.The statistics on TB are astonishing. It kills more than two million people every year. One third of the world s population is infected.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said that more than 50000 South Africans (more than 1% of the population) develop active TB each year and it is a leading cause of death.Working together, we have seen significant progress.Over the past decade mortality and prevalence rates have declined significantly, and detection rates a key to treating the disease timeously have increased. However, more can and must be done, this is not a once-off battle, it must be a sustained campaign against a determined foe.March 24, 1882The world commemorates World TB Day today. On this day, we recognise the day in 1882 when Dr Robert Koch announced that he had discovered the cause of tuberculosis, the TB bacillus.This discovery led to the eventual development of a cure.We acknowledge that TB remains an epidemic in many parts of the developing world. It is not an insignificant threat but an ongoing and continuing challenge to our health and our future.It is therefore an appropriate time to propose that investment in TB control and other core public health functions is perhaps the best way to take the fight against TB to the next level.So why is it so difficult to eradicate the scourge of TB altogether?TB is an airborne disease that principally affects the lungs. It is passed on, in part, through coughing and sneezing. This means that most South Africans have been exposed to TB.Tuberculosis is able to remain dormant in a person, becoming active again in the event that the patient s immune system is weakened, as in the case of HIV infection.Due to the socio-economic conditions a sizeable part of the population still suffer with TB, even outside of TB infection.Actively addressing the various socioeconomic factors still remains a critical way to curb TB infection. Although treatable, TB is potentially deadly, especially for those who have Aids.It is the leading cause of death among Africans infected with HIV. According to statistics from the WHO, 90% of people living with HIV-Aids in Africa die within months of contracting TB.Once a person is found to have TB, state and local health officials follow the case aggressively. That may mean requiring patients to visit a clinic day or each week for medication or in some cases, sending public health nurses to their homes to manage the medication effectively.Patients may feel better before the disease is truly gone and family, nurses and/or colleagues must make sure the patients stay on their medication for six months to a year.If not, the disease may return, threatening the patient s life and jeopardising the people around him or her.A patient who has stopped medication may see the disease return in a drug-resistant form.Indeed, although our country has been strengthening the anti-TB initiatives, the emergence of extremely drug resistant (XDR) TB has also been threatening to undermine gains made in the fight against the disease.According to researchers, it is an added challenge that people who have both TB and HIV infection experience a unique and overlapping double stigma .In some areas, TB seems to sends a signal that the person also has HIV. As a consequence, some co-infected individuals put TB in the foreground, underplay the HIV, to minimise the HIV stigma.This finding may have implications for the uptake of services which integrate TB and HIV care.The WHO said so far, many TB and HIV programmes in the continent or anywhere in the world, do not cooperate with one another, despite the strong connection that exists between HIV and TB.Researchers said 75% to 80% of the people living with TB are co-infected with HIV. The researchers said HIV has always been the big kid on the block, with TB being the little brother. HIV programmes and organisations seem to be afraid that TB may takes away HIV attention and funding.These funding tensions cause an unfortunate lack of collaboration between HIV and TB programmes.Tuberculosis in Africa cannot be adequately dealt with until TB and HIV-Aids organisations set aside their differences. This has been a major drive in South Africa and headway has been made in a few areas.So how can we reduce the prevalence of TB?Unlike flu, which follows known seasonal patterns and allowing for simulated preparation, TB is a constant presence that requires real-time responses that carry real-time consequences.Mass screening, public notification, treatment regimens that include drug-resistant ones, isolation where required and in-home support are key.Monitoring the disease is important and is run mainly by the state at present, typically at special TB clinics.To my mind, the ongoing practice of high quality TB control is the best way to deal with the disease.Curing those with TB is only part of the battle. Vaccines that can prevent TB infection are also critically important.Although the major international development agencies are providing significant support to treat people with TB, investment in TB vaccine development.Moreover, an effective TB response requires that local and provincial and private health care facilities and private funders to work closely and creatively together with clinical physicians, private and public hospital systems to drastically reduce the infection rate. Ongoing discussions should delineate a path whereby prevention, treatment, referral and funding can be shared across all the roleplayers.You can also participate in reducing the prevalence of this disease.By learning more about TB and encouraging friends and family members to practice simple preventive steps, you become part of the cure. Together, we can take the next giant leap in combating TB in South Africa.Dr Lungi Nyathi is executive director for Medscheme/ AfroCentric Health
