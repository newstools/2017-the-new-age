The National Prosecuting Authority has welcomed the seven life terms imposed on serial killer Lentsha Molefe by the Free State High Court last week.The 34-year-old Lesotho national was found guilty of killing seven of his relatives and a family friend and burying them in shallow graves from 2008 to 2015.He was sentenced by judge Joseph Mhlambi last week.According to evidence presented in court, Molefe murdered his first victim, Ntswaki Lefatsa in January 2008 at Geduld farm in Kestell.The second murder took place in June 2010 when he murdered Ntswaki s mother, Mantswaki Lefatsa.Molefe continued his killing spree when he murdered Makamohelo Molefe in June 2014 and three months later in September, he took the life of Matukiso Lefatsa.Two months later he murdered Matukiso s three-year- old son, Tukiso.Molefe murdered two more women, Daisy Mokhonoanaze in August 2015 and Lieketso Lefatsa the following month.The six relatives were from Mokhotlong in Lesotho while Mokhoanaze hailed from Reitz.His crimes were uncovered when a community member, Chitoni Mokoena was looking for discarded scrap metal in the forest at the farm and picked up a foul smell emanating from a nearby spot. When he followed the stench he stumbled upon two graves.Police exhumed two bodies from the graves. The bodies were later identified as those of Daisy Mokhoanaze, 26, and Ntswaki Lefatsa, 17. Four more bodies were later exhumed from the farm.Molefe was arrested in October 2015 in Carletonville where he had fled to.Arguing in aggravation of sentence, the state prosecutor, advocate Jannie Botha, told the court all the murders were premeditated and the accused did not show any remorse. The accused committed these crimes over a period of seven years and the murders were committed in cold blood. One of the victims was burnt after being killed and if it was not because of a community member who came across the graves, his heinous crimes would have probably not been revealed. The community needs protection from serious offenders like the accused, Botha said.In sentencing Molefe, Mhlambi saidthat he failed to provide the court with any substantial and compelling circumstances to deviate from the prescribed sentence.He subsequently sentenced Molefe to life imprisonment on each count of murder. He further declared him unfit to possess a firearm.The director of public prosecutions in the Free State, advocate Xolisile Khanyile, applauded the good work by the prosecutor and the investigating officers Lt-Col Teboho Peete and Lt-Col Morena Motloung in ensuring that this remorseless murderer was removed from society. We hope that this sentence will serve as a deterrent to would-be offenders and the NPA is very pleased with the conviction and sentence. Justice has really been served, Khanyile said.KAMOGELO SEEKOEIkamogelos@thenewage.co.za
