SUSPECTED cable thieves learnt the hard way that the law does not take a break when the rest of the country winds down over the festive period.Two Ghanaians were arrested on the N1 Freeway near De Doorns in the Western Cape when the vehicle they were travelling in was stopped by SAPS officers.Upon inspection, more than 1 200m of copper cable, identified as belonging to Eskom, was found in the vehicle.The suspects were arrested on the scene and a case was opened at the Nyanga SAPS. Further investigation linked the suspects to others who were previously detained in the Western Cape for similar crimes. We believe the arrest in the Western Cape has brought us a step closer to dismantling what seems to be a syndicate that specialises in cable theft in the province, a spokesperson for Eskom s security investigations said. Our thanks go to all the members of the various law enforcement agencies in South Africa who work tirelessly, even over public holidays, to help create a safe environment for all inhabitants of this country, he said.The arrests were among many others reported in recent months as Eskom continues to intensify its fight against cable theft and electricity theft. Tip-offs relating to suspected cable theft or electricity theft can be sent anonymously via SMS to Operation Khanyisa, Eskom s campaign that fights electricity theft, on 32211 (R1/SMS).In Johannesburg, December 16 started off as normal for one of the suspects, a Zimbabwean national who runs a scrap metal dealership in one of Johannesburg s northern suburbs.This scrap yard was fully operational, even on a public holiday. Things quickly changed when Eskom investigators, following up on a tip-off, pounced on the scrap yard and found the owner busy processing copper cable from a stolen Eskom transformer.The copper cable and transformer box were confiscated as evidence while the scrap yard owner was arrested and handed over to the Ivory Park SAPS.-TNA Reporter
