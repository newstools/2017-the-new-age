Labour at Vantage Goldfields Lily Gold Mine in Barberton have shamed mining bosses and the government for the snail s pace taken in retrieving the bodies of three trapped mineworkers who were buried in a sinkhole at the mine, over a year ago.The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) president Joseph Mathunjwa, making reference to yesterday s one-year anniversary of the Lily mine disaster, laid the logjam squarely on the doorstep of businesses and government.He slammed mining industry stakeholders for the laissez-faire attitude in bringing closure to the bereaved families, exactly 12 months since a container carrying the employees plunged 80m underground during a cave-in. It s a shame and a disgrace for the entire mining industry, for the Department of Minerals and Resources and the government in its entirety that one year after the Lily Mine disaster there is no closure for the families of Yvonne Mnisi, Pretty Nkambule and Solomon Nyarenda, their comrades and the community of Barberton, Mathunjwa said.He decried the apparent callousness from industry stakeholders in finding a solution to the tragedy. As we come full circle since the tragic collapse of a crown pillar that swallowed three miners into the belly of the earth, we mourn the derelict apathy from authorities to decisively deal with this matter.The mining industry has been the bedrock of South African vampire capitalism, whose tree has been watered by the sweat and blood of cheap black migrant labour. Lily mine management cancelled a memorial service for the three employees amid fears it could renew fresh hostilities between unions at the mine.BONOLO SELEBANObonolos@thenewage.co.za
