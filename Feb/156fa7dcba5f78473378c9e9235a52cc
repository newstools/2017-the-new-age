FREE State Stars have started preparing for a future without highly valued players Moeketsi Sekola and Thato Thlone. Thlone and Sekola have made the decision to leave Ea Lla Koto at the end of the season after each had spent four years with the Bethlehem outfit. The 26-year-old Thlone has signed a pre-contract with Absa Premiership title contenders Bidvest Wits, while Sekola will be leaving for relegation-threatened Highlands Park.The two players have been key players for Stars in past seasons and it was no surprise they drew a lot of interest from other PSL clubs. Ea Lla Koto coach Serame Letsoaka said there was a huge need to bring in players who have been identified as replacements for the two and that s why the club brought in Thabang Matuka from Bloemfontein Celtic and Gabonese striker Allen Nono. It is known that Thlone is leaving us at the end of the season so we needed someone who will take over his role when that happens and we believe Matuka is the right person for that, Letsoaka said. For now he will be a backup to Thlone because you never know what will happen in football, so we need a proper backup in that position. Sekola has signed a pre-contract with Highlands Park, we saw Nono as a player who will be a perfect replacement for him. Nono is a striker who is strong and powerful on the ball with a lot of experience as he has played for a number of clubs in his home country, I believe he will make a positive difference. We are looking now because we don t want to start looking after Thlone and Sekola have already left. Stars have also roped in three more players in Simphiwe Mtsweni, Mohammad Anas and Nhlakanipho Ntuli from FC Twente of Holland.sithembisod@thenewage.co.za-Sithembiso Dindi
