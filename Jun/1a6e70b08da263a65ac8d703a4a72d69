Several cases that will clarify the legal obligation of motorists to pay e-tolls are expected to appear before the courts soon.Thousands of motorists are sitting with summonses, according to Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi. Some of these matters are far advanced and several court cases are foreseen shortly that will clarify the legal obligation to pay toll for the Gauteg Freeways Improvement Project toll-roads, he said in reply to a question from EFF MP Thilivhali Mulaudzi. This is an ongoing process, Maswanganyi said.He said that from last November to June this year, a total of 199 729 account units were registered. Sanral, as the agency responsible for national roads and the GFIP is issuing civil summonses to thousands of debtors. Some of these matters are far advanced and several court cases are foreseen shortly that will clarify the legal obligation to pay toll for the GFIP toll-roads, he said.Responding to a question from DA MP Ian Ollis, Maswanganyi said Sanral was aware that the concrete palisade fence along the N3 freeway near Alexandra township was continuously being vandalised. The community (pedestrians) removes the fence uprights to gain access into the road reserve in order to walk a shorter distance to the Industrial area across the freeway, through the N3 freeway and Marlboro Drive, he said.As part of its maintenance programme, he said, Sanral continuously has the national road network supervised by Routine Road Maintenance (RRM) engineering consultants and contractors. They patrolled their respective routes daily. Regarding the above-mentioned route, the RRM engineering consultant and contractor has inspected the area. The fence has been broken in two localised areas. The fence is being repaired continuously due to vandalism by pedestrians. The contractor has also been instructed to repair the fence and will commence with the work as soon as the funds were available.DENNIS CRUYWAGENdennisc@thenewage.co.za
