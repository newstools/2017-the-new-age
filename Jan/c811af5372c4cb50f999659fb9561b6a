Ivory Coast&#8217;s President Alassane Ouattara named former prime minister Daniel Kablan Duncan as vice-president, a new post created under a constitution approved by referendum late last year.Duncan, 73, an economist, has served in posts at the West African central bank and as finance minister and is among Ouattara&#8217;s closest long-time collaborators. He resigned as prime minister on Monday.&#8220;This is a person of experience, a great servant of the state, who has demonstrated his exceptional personal and professional qualities in all the high functions he has occupied,&#8221; Ouattara said in a speech to lawmakers.In Duncan, Ouattara &#8211; himself an economist and former senior International Monetary Fund official &#8211; has chosen a vice-president largely in his own image.The post of vice-president was included in a new constitution enacted in November to help ensure a smooth succession of power in the event the sitting president dies or is incapacitated while in office.It has also been seen by many in Ivory Coast as a vehicle to allow Ouattara to groom a successor for when he finishes his second and final term in 2020.Duncan dissolved the government on Monday, a move that had been expected after last month&#8217;s election but which was delayed by two days by an army mutiny.Ouattara dismissed the heads of the army, police and gendarmes after the two-day mutiny by soldiers demanding the payment of bonuses and wage rises.-Reuters
