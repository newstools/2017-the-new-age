THE National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said it still has to study the findings from an investigation into a police shooting which left a woman dead in Dunoon. Last year Pumeza Fudumele was shot dead in a reported case of mistaken identity. Police officers opened fire on a taxi in the area as they believed the vehicle had been used in an ATM robbery. Early last year, two McDonald s workers were killed after police mistakenly shot at a taxi they were travelling in, in the Blue Downs area. A week prior to that incident, officers opened fire on a taxi transporting Nando s employees in Dunoon, killing Fudumele. In both cases it is reported police mistook the vehicles the workers were travelling in as getaway vehicles used in armed robberies. McDonald s said it provided support and legal assistance to the affected workers and the families of the deceased. The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) said it had concluded its investigations and had referred both cases to the director of public prosecutions. Ipid s Moses Dlamini said it had concluded its investigation and had handed the case to the NPA. Ipid recommended that some of the police officers involved in the shooting be prosecuted, but it will all depend on the director of public prosecutions. Forensic scientist David Klatzow has been appointed by Nando s and its attorneys to investigate the shooting involving two Nando s staff members and police in Dunoon. The taxi was transporting a group of Nando s workers at the end of their shift when the shooting occurred. One woman was killed and another wounded. Klatzow said it appeared the directorate, together with the South African Police Service, had done very little to investigate this case so far. TATENDA CHIRISERI
