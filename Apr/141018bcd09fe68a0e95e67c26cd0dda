Pepsi faced massive social media backlash after they debuted their latest ad campaign on Tuesday which many feels it undermines the Black Lives Matter movement.The ad shows model Kendall Jenner abandoning her photoshoot to join a protest. She is then seen handing a police officer a Pepsi, seemingly imitating a black woman who was pictured at a Black Lives Matter protest in July last year.The Rep Project @TheRepProject 8h 8 hours ago Here are some of the reactions:Who knew if Black lives matter had changed changed the slogan to hands up here s a Pepsi , we would have solved everything #pepsi&mdash; Barack O (@BObamathoughts) April 5, 2017Here&#39;s a question&#8230; What did #Pepsi gain with that black lives matter pandering?
