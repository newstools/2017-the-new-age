The South African Weather Service warned that fog patches could be expected in places between Cunene River and Cape Point, spreading along the south-coast reaching East London tomorrow evening. </p> This may cause poor visibility at sea. </p> This as the National Sea Rescue Institute in East London spent Saturday night trying to ensure that two men in a yacht stayed alive at sea. </p> The NSRI in East London received a panicked call from two men, aged 53 and 44, who were on their way to deliver a yacht to its owner in Mossel Bay, but had run out of fuel at sea. </p> On top of that, they were battling heavy weather. </p> However, they could not be helped immediately. </p> NSRI East London, East London Port Control and Telkom Maritime Radio Services monitored the yacht through the night and NSRI East London duty crew remained on alert and prepared to launch at any time, the NSIR said. </p> When help arrived, the two men told the crew they were already tired and that they had run out of fuel off Port Edward. </p> They had sailed comfortably in 2m swells and a 15 knot North Easterly wind to where they believed they were not far from East London. They then turned around and sailed with the wind which had changed to a Southerly, picking up to 30 knots and a sea swell of up to seven meters, which forced them to remain awake and to sail through the rough seas, the NSIR said. </p> At sunrise TNPA East London Port Control requested the NSRI East London duty crew to launch to assist the yacht after sea conditions had deteriorated. </p> But after coordinates provided by the crew of Sticky Fingers appeared not to correspond with where we thought that they may be, the Eastern Cape government health EMS dispatched a rescue helicopter from Umtata. Following a search the helicopter crew found them off Bashee on the Transkei Coast. </p> The two men were examined by paramedics. One had a sprained ankle while the other was unharmed. </p> They flew back home yesterday morning. 701198 TNA Reporter
