Apple CEO Tim Cook has revealed for the first time the company s plans in the automotive market. Cook had a wide-ranging interview with Bloomberg Businessweek where he said Apple viewed autonomous driving systems as a core technology for the future.He confirmed that his company was working on self-driving car technology. Cook told Bloomberg television that Apple wanted to move into the automotive sector because there is a major disruption looming from new technologies. We re not really saying from a product point of view, what we will do. It s a core technology that we view as very important, Cook said in the interview.The motoring sector, Cook said, was being transformed by artificial intelligence and autonomous driving technology as well as by the development of better electric cars and the growth of ride-sharing. We are focusing on autonomous systems, he said. He said Apple saw this as the mother of all artificial intelligence projects and that this was a core technology that we view as very important . While Apple has given no indication of specific projects for autonomous vehicles, it has joined the list of companies with permits to test self-driving cars in California, according to state records.The California-based tech giant is expected to focus on software systems, letting partners manufacture vehicles, but would understandably want to be able to test its navigation technology in cars. Meanwhile, California and other states will be barred from setting their own rules governing design and testing of self-driving cars, while federal regulators will be blocked from demanding pre-market approval for autonomous vehicle technology, according to a US House Republican proposal reviewed by Reuters.According to Reuters, the draft legislation, while far from becoming law, still represents a victory for General Motors, Alphabet, Tesla and other car makers and technology companies seeking to persuade Congress and the Trump administration to pre-empt rules under consideration in California, New York and other states that could limit deployment of self-driving vehicles.-INDIE BOYCE|indiphileb@thenewage.co.za
