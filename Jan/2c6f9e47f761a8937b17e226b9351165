THE port of Ngqura is poised to play a vital role in ensuring the security of South Africa s fuel supply while creating a new petroleum trading hub for southern Africa in anticipation of the relocation of existing liquid bulk facilities from Port Elizabeth.This follows the conclusion of an agreement between Transnet National Ports Authority (TNPA) and Oil-Tanking Grindrod Calulo (OTGC) to plan, fund, construct, own and operate a new liquid bulk handling facility at Ngqura. The project is one of the Section 56 initiatives that TNPA has identified to encourage private sector participation as a key element of the company s market demand strategy.It will provide storage and marine infrastructure to support the overall petroleum demand projections for South Africa. Bulk liquids such as petroleum, diesel, jet fuel, illuminating paraffin and liquid petroleum gas, will be transported to Ngqura via ship and piped to the tank farm prior to local supply and/or local and global re-export.The facility will create a new tank farm for the province when the existing lease for petroleum storage facilities at the Port Elizabeth harbour expires.OTGC was appointed as the preferred bidder following an open and transparent tender process. We are excited that the agreement with OTGC has been concluded and that we can welcome a world-class independent storage operator to the Port of Ngqura, Richard Vallihu, chief executive of TNPA, said. When the Ngqura facility becomes operational, the Port Elizabeth tank farm will be decommissioned and the site will be rehabilitated, which will free up port land for future expansion plans at Port Elizabeth. OTGC, a majority South African owned Level 2 BBBEE company, is an independent bulk liquid storage provider which combines Oiltanking GmbH s world-class expertise in handling bulk liquids with the local expertise and the full BEE credentials of Grindrod South Africa and Calulo Terminals.It is one of the world s leading independent storage partners for oils, chemicals, gases and dry bulk and owns and operates 81 terminals in 23 countries with a total storage capacity of 21 million cubic meters. As an independent bulk liquid logistics operator, OTGC has been investigating the petroleum and chemical market in South Africa for several years. Petroleum demand projections for South Africa strongly support the need for significant investments in tank storage infrastructure to cater for the country s liquid fuel supply, Gideon Loudon, OTGC CEO, said. OTGC s main objective in the Port of Ngqura is to develop a world-class, highly efficient and responsibly operated liquid bulk terminal facility in South Africa.OTGC will build the terminal facility in strict accordance with the oil-tanking global technical, operating and HSSEQ standards. Construction of the facility is estimated to begin in September and continue until June 2019.It will be commissioned during JuneJuly 2019 and the planned operational date is August 2019. The liquid bulk facility at the port includes the loading and offloading facilities at berth B100, the services and equipment to perform operations at the berth, pipeline connectivity to the liquid bulk facility, the buildings, tanks, structures, paving and surfacing on the 20 hectare site designated as the liquid bulk facility.Ngqura became operational in October 2009 and is the newest port owned and managed by TNPA. Port infrastructure for the liquid bulk facility is in place at the port and bulk services and road access to the facility have already been completed.Ngqura is strategically placed to service southern African, Asian and South American trade routes and, with access to excellent deep water, has the potential to establish itself as a global transhipment hub focussed on these major trade routes.Phase 1 of the liquid bulk facility will provide for 158000 cubic metres of storage capacity for refined products such as petroleum, diesel, jet fuel, illuminated paraffin and liquid petroleum gas.Products will be received via vessel and distributed by road and the annual throughput is expected to be 1 250000 cubic metres. Future phases will provide for an additional 550000 cubic metres of storage capacity available for third party storage.The liquid bulk facility will create socio-economic benefits and will boost the economies of the Eastern Cape and Nelson Mandela Bay municipality. 701198TNA REPORTER
