Chinese e-commerce titan Alibaba will take control of domestic department store Intime through a $2.6 billion privatisation scheme, the companies said Tuesday, sending shares of the mall operator surging.Alibaba, and Intime founder Shen Guojun have together offered to pay HK$10 per share to buy the shares they do not already own of the Hong Kong-listed chain. The deal will increase Alibaba&#8217;s stake from 28 percent to 74 percent after it first invested $692 million in the firm in 2014.News of the deal sent Intime&#8217;s shares soaring 35.7 percent to HK$9.54 in Hong Kong Tuesday. The maximum cash required for the proposal is expected to be HK$19.8 billion ($2.6 billion), the statement said.The deal will see Alibaba expand further into physical stores, which founder Jack Ma envisions integrating with the company&#8217;s online platforms and logistics network. Intime operates 29 department stores and 17 shopping malls throughout China. The move came after Ma &#8212; China&#8217;s richest man &#8212; met US President-elect Donald Trump in New York Monday to discuss how Alibaba can help create US jobs.Alibaba is China&#8217;s dominant player in online commerce, with its Taobao platform estimated to hold more than 90 percent of the consumer-to-consumer market, while its Tmall platform is believed to have more than half of business-to-consumer transactions.The deal shows department store chains &#8220;are still relevant and of value&#8221; to e-commerce players, Catherine Lim, analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence told Bloomberg News. &#8220;We could be seeing renewal of a sunset industry,&#8221; she added.Alibaba chief executive Daniel Zhang said in the statement that bricks-and-mortar businesses will be able to create value for consumers if they are integrated with the power of mobile reach . Nearly 80 percent of its business comes from mobile sales as of September, Alibaba said in the statement.The offer represented a 54 percent premium over the two-month average closing price before shares were suspended in December.-AFP
