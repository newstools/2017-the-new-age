ADARYLL Simpson, 29, who obtained a BPharm degree from the University of the Western Cape yesterday, is proof that something good can come out of gang-infested Elsies River. He beat the odds, resisted the temptation of drugs and gangsterism that have permeated the area and showed that with perseverance, commitment and faith, one can rise to the occasion. Yesterday he became the first person in his family to obtain a degree. In a message of hope to the young people of Elsie’s River, Simpson said: “All is not lost and if you want to become a success in life, you can rise above your circumstances.” Reflecting on tough times during the four-year study period he endured, Simpson said the hardest part was managing his time between being a full-time worker and a full-time student. “The drive to excel in my studies came about due to my living conditions. I had to make the best of my situation. When I started studying, it was essentially to have a better life for me and my family. I am the sole breadwinner in my household for my mother and my uncle.” Shortly after matriculating from Elsie’s River High School, Simpson went to work at Melomed Hospital in Bellville where he got an opportunity to further his education. “Melomed CEO Ebrahim Bhorat offered to send me to university only if I promised to pass the courses, which I did. My love for pharmacy started there and then. Hard work, dedication, time management and perseverance were a few of the qualities I had to acquire while completing my degree.” Simpson has been working at Melomed for seven years and he has gained valuable practical knowledge there. His future plans involve gaining more experience in the field of hospital pharmacy and also completing his Master’s degree and eventually his PhD in clinical pharmacy. vincentc@thenewage.co.za -VINCENT CRUYWAGEN
