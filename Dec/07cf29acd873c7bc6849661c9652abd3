The Durban Regional Court on Wednesday morning heard how a mother lied about her infant daughter being kidnapped earlier this year. During her appearance, the woman, who is not being named to protect the identity of the child, pleaded guilty to charges of fraud, defeating the administration of justice and making a false statement. In March, she reported that she had been hijacked and that the alleged hijackers sped off with her car, while her one-month-old baby was still in the back seat. The car was later found abandoned in Montclair with the baby missing. Following a two-day search, led by the police and community members, the one-month-old baby girl was found at the Mariannhill Toll Plaza where the police saw a suspicious looking car. Her co-accused Phumlani Mbokazi’s case will continue next month and the woman is expected to be sentenced next year. -TNA Reporter
