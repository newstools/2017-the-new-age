Lawyer for the Minister of Police Nazeer Cassim today told the Gauteng North High Courte court that the Hawks boss Berning Ntlemeza came to court to score power political points .Cassim argued that the court should dismiss former Hawks boss application, arguing that he was still on full pay, adding that his matter would be ventilated at the Supreme Court of Appeal in two weeks time. Ntlemeza is coming here to score power political points. His matter will be fully ventilated in the SCA in two weeks, Cassim told the court.Ntlemeza is trying to force the high court to interdict Police Minister Fikile Mbalula from preventing him from assuming his position as head of the Hawks., Mbalula s lawyer emphasised that the judgement stood until it was set aside by the court, adding that at least four judges had found that Ntlemeza acted dishonourable .But Ntlemeza s lawyer argued that the matter was urgent and that it was unacceptable that the minister should not be allowed to trample on the rights of his client, with Cassim rebutting the argument, telling the court that that it would be a sad situation if the matter would be struck of the roll due to lack of urgency.-Sipho Jack
