Cashbuild has recorded a 6% decrease in headline earnings for the year ended June in the face of the tough economic environment.Cashbuild is southern Africa s largest retailer of building materials and associated products with 242 stores in South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Botswana, Swaziland, Malawi and Zambia. The group increased its revenue by 12% whilst gross profit increased by 10%. This increase for the year has been achieved in tough trading conditions with selling price inflation of 2% .Revenue for its stores in existence prior to July 2015 decreased by 2% while 23 new stores contributed 4% and P&amp;L Hardware contributed 10% to revenue growth. During the financial year, Cashbuild opened 12 new stores, 12 stores were refurbished, two stores were relocated and four P&amp;L Hardware stores were opened. Two stores were closed, one traded in close proximity to another Cashbuild store and the other reached the end of its lease term.The DIY pilot continues with nine Cashbuild stores. Cashbuild is also continuing its store expansion, relocation and refurbishment strategy in a controlled manner, applying the same rigorous process as in the past. The group acquired 100% of P&amp;L Hardware for R350m and a further R80m payable if certain profit targets are met over a three-year period.The rationale for the acquisition is to expand Cashbuild s geographical footprint and market share. It is intended that P&amp;L Hardware will remain and grow as a separate brand to Cashbuild. The company declared a dividend of R3,90 a share, down 7% from the prior period.-THELMA NGOMA|thelman@thenewage.co.za
