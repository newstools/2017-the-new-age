South Africa is a nation at war with itself and its citizens have armed themselves with weapons of hatred, intolerance and prejudice.This after the furore that erupted this week over a verbal bust-up between a black woman, Lebohang Mabuya, and a white man at a Spur restaurant in Oakdene, Johannesburg.At one end of the spectrum was a vitriolic attack by a white man on a black woman and at the other, a provocation in the presence of several black restaurant employees who tacitly submitted to the bully.I am in no way suggesting that Spur staffers should have responded in kind as that would have heightened the prospects of further conflict. However, when one is conscious of an injustice and thereafter feigns moral blindness to it, then it should be called out for what it is.The above scenario contains multiple layers where undertones of racism, misogyny and feelings of disempowerment on the part of the employees all converged.In the wake of the incident, there was little consensus among social media users alike on whether Mabuya was on the receiving end of a racially motivated diatribe or just a victim of another adult misbehaving badly.I believe the latter to be a pretext for avoiding the uncomfortable truth. It s a defence that can only be seen as an attempt to defend the morally reprehensible.While racist and sexist undertones may be more bland, they are no less damaging.This suggests that the scope of racism is not only limited to using the K-word but includes a broad range of prejudicial actions against someone on the basis of skin colour.In this regard, the much vaunted argument that blacks are race-obsessed has reached its point of exhaustion. Racism is not a mental projection clouding the ability of black South Africans to discern racism (subtle and obvious) from negligible bursts of anger from their fellow white countrymen.Racism is real and seeps into our daily lives, and the Spur restaurant saga is one of the many slights and indignities experienced by blacks in South Africa. Rubbing salt into the wound was the endless stream of didactic lectures by white South Africans telling their fellow black countrymen how to identify and respond to acts of racism.Such discussions are patronising and undermines the experience of racial abuse.Another layer in the scenario revealed several black employees who were stuck in the quicksand of inaction, while a patron nearly had a table bashed against her in full view of everyone there.In the same manner that Mabuya s case shone the spotlight on how unequal power relations between genders manifest in instances of conflict, the waiters passivity revealed how unequal power relations between races can rear its ugly head in the work.place. Paradoxically, work spaces can become places of disempowerment for blacks who are seen as merely cogs in the machine.Exposure to this over a period of time, especially for those on the bottom rung, could render such places as extension s of the baaskap, a system of absolute domination of one group over another. Perhaps this lay behind the difficulty experienced by the employees to speak out against the aggressor.Spur, in a statement, had this to say about the conduct of its staff members during the melee: We have acknowledged that the staff and management of the store did not sufficiently assist Ms Mabuya and we are reviewing our internal procedures to ensure that restaurant staff are better equipped to manage an incident such as this. Spur also said that after reviewing its own CCTV footage of the incident, it apologised unreservedly to Mabuya. We have reviewed our CCTV footage of the incident and can confirm that Ms Mabuya s version of events is accurate; the footage shows that her child was grabbed by the male customer in an aggressive manner and his actions are unacceptable. We affirm our decision to ban the male customer from our stores, physical aggression towards our customers, particularly against women and children will not be tolerated, it said.Spur CEO Pierre van Tonder said: As an organisation we have learnt a valuable lesson and it is my priority at this stage to ensure that should something like this happen again, our staff will be sufficiently prepared. It is not yet Uhuru for a great many black and white South Africans. While some have bore the brunt of racism s brutality, others remain shackled in the chains of narrow-mindedness and prejudice.Bonolo SelebanoBonolo Selebano is political reporter for The New Age
