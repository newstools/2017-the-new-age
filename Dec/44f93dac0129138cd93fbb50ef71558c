As the second day of the ANC’s 54th national elective conference draws to a close and delegates cast their votes, it is becoming clear who they want as their preferred leadership. During the nominations processes on Sunday, the majority of delegates were singing pro Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma and Ace Magashule songs. Nominations got off to a rocky start when Electoral Commission Chairperson Sindiso Mfenyana argued with delegates over branches nominating the people they know. Delegates didn’t want to hear any of it, saying that as branch delegates, they were expected to be persuaded and persuade as well, when choosing delegates. Mpumalanga deputy secretary Lindiwe Ntshalintshali said delegates must be free to lobby each other. “Delegates must be free to lobby each other and the electoral commission must stay out of politics.” Eventually, the conference went ahead. Delegates nominated current Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa for the presidential position, a post he will contest with Dlamini Zuma. David Mabuza and Lindiwe Sisulu were nominated for the deputy president post. The position of national chairperson will be contested by both outgoing Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe and Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa while the Treasurer-General position will be contested by Maite Nkoana-Mashabane and Paul Mashatile. The party’s administrative position, which is secretary-general will be fiercely contested by  Magashule and former KZN chairperson Senzo Mchunu while the deputy position will be contested by Jessie Duarte and Zingiswa Losi. Meanwhile, on Saturday Magashule told members of the media at the University of Johannesburg he was confident that Dlamini Zuma would win the election. The voting session is expected to take place immediately, after the Electoral Commission has finished  preparing ballot papers. -Sipho Jack
