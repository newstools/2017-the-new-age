The recently concluded 28th summit of the African Union (AU) was a politically eventful gathering judging by the sheer nature of the items on its agenda.It will probably go down in history as one of those summits whose outcomes will reverberate on the continent for some time to come and which undoubtedly tested both the unity of purpose and the unity in action, as far as the pursuit of an agenda the continent that we want to see is concerned.Among the many items that required the decisions of the continent s leadership were such issues as Morocco s admission to the AU and the reforms of the AU Commission (AUC) so as to make it effectively responsive to the challenges confronting Africa as well as on who should carry out the necessary tasks to lead the implementation of the AU s programme of work for the next four years.It is worth observing that in the cause of a concerted interest on issues of leadership contestations, and the readmission of Morocco, the media gaze was taken off from what is arguably the most critical matter on the continent today, and indeed the main theme of the Summit, that is, harnessing the demographic dividend through investment in youth. The AU was correct to dedicate 2017 to advancing the agenda of young Africans, who in one way or another continue to confront various challenges which frustrate the realisation of their aspirations.In several African countries it is the young people who are at the coal face of the triple scourge of poverty, unemployment and inequality; whose aspirations for a better continent are frustrated due to inter alia, the inability to move freely across the continent owing to man-made hurdles and whose yearning for a life in freedom is inhibited by governments that are not always responsive to their aspirations.In any event, one of the widely reported decisions was the admission of Morocco as a member of the AU. The full impact of this decision is yet to be felt, indeed its implications deserve a separate analysis. Suffice to state, firstly, that back in 1984 the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) never expelled Morocco. Instead, Morocco opted to abandon the OAU following a decision to recognise the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) as the custodian of the inalienable right to self-determination of the peoples of Western Sahara.Secondly, this decision was reached through a vote (39 in favour and 15 against), which showed weakening decades-long African consensus on the question of Western Sahara. South Africa is among those that remained firm in its support for Western Sahara, informed as it is by the historical fraternal relations between the ANC and the Polisario Front.The all-important issue pertaining to the reforms of the AU was addressed to put measures that will ensure that the functioning of the commission enables it to fulfil the decisions of the summit and thereby meets the aspirations of the peoples of Africa.Subsequent to the tabling of the Report on the Reforms by President Paul Kagame of Rwanda, it would be interesting to watch the speed with which the elected leadership implements the reforms, as decided by the summit.On the question of the new chairperson of the commission, while it may have not been clear prior to the summit who would emerge victorious from the five candidates, what was certain was that the heads of state were not going to depart from Addis having not decided on the new leadership following the failure to do so during the 27th Summit held in July.And thus, after seven rounds of voting, Chad s Foreign Minister Moussa Faki Mahamat received the necessary two-thirds majority to chair the AUC. He went head to head in a close race with Kenya s Amina Mohamed following the elimination of Botswana s Pelonomi Venson-Moitoi, Equatorial Guinea s Agapito Mba Mokuy and Senegal s Abdoulaye Bathily in preceding rounds.Mahamat, who has been at the forefront of the fight against extremism in Mali, Nigeria and the Sahel more broadly, promised to ride on from his predecessor s vision enshrined in Agenda 2063. To Mahamat, development and security will be at the top of his agenda as would the AU s clarion call to silence the guns by 2020 which he says under his tenure, the sound of guns will be drowned out by cultural songs and rumbling factories and pledged to streamline the bureaucratic AU during his four-year term in office.As part of reflections on matters of peace and security on the continent, the summit recognised the combined efforts of Ecowas, the UN and AU, to ensure that the situation in The Gambia was resolved peacefully. Many a lesson are yet to be drawn from Ecowas experience of managing a complex political process in order to ensure that the will of the Gambian people is not compromised by the personal interests of former president Jammeh.Perhaps as a parting shot, the outgoing chairperson launched a critique on the decision of President Donald Trump to temporarily suspend the entry of nationals from seven countries, three of which are in Africa (Somalia, Sudan and Libya) into the US. The very country to whom many of our people were taken as slaves during the transatlantic slave trade has now decided to ban refugees from some of our countries. What do we do about this? This is one of the greatest challenges to our unity and solidarity, the chairperson said.A keen observer of international relations and Africa s place in it, both in historical and contemporary terms, would not lose sight of such a powerful message, which shines a spotlight on the impact that some of the decisions that continue to be made by external powers, have on the psyche of the African.Senzo NgubaneSenzo Ngubane is general manager of operations at the African Centre for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes
