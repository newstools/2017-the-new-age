It may have seemed as if the first black vice-chancellor at North West University (NWU) Prof Dan Kgwadi had been coopted into the system that has stifled transformation at the institution but the reality is that negotiation takes time.Kgwadi told The New Age that the university was now entering a critical phase where energy and skill expended in crafting the transformation plan should be harnessed to make sure the implementation phase is done to the letter.The transformation model brings about a new structure that bridges the seemingly autonomous nature of the three campuses into one unitary institution. The NWU comprises the Potchefstroom, Mafikeng and Vaal Triangle campuses. We have done most of the ground work and we are waiting for the higher education department to ratify the university statute. Once that is done and it is published in the government Gazette, we start the implementation process, Kgwadi said.Projections are that possibly by the end of January, the much-awaited journey to a unitary institution will take its first steps. The key element of this transformation drive is a one dean one faculty scenario. This will ensure equity of provision of resources, he said.As it is now, the three campuses do not share curriculum for similar courses with each faculty dean designing his/her own curriculum for students at a specific campus.For instance, programmes like law would have different course outlines yet the certificate upon graduation is the same.At times, students at one campus would feel hard-done because their peers would seem to be doing far better in their learning than them.Prof Kgwadi said that under the new model, not only are the courses synchronised but there should be distribution of teaching staff across all campuses as well. What we are doing is not renewing dean posts to and because this is a temporary position, those affected will fall back on other academic duties.The university will honour and respect all those deans whose contracts are still running.The other good this is that no one is losing employment because of the model, only very few people are affected due to the restructuring, Kgwadi added.The new structure will bring about a change to the way the student representative council (SRC) runs at present. Instead of having three structures, there will be one SRC constituted on the proportional representation basis. This means that going by the student population size, the Potchefstroom campus will have more members in the new body.At campuses, we will have councils that would work together with the SRC to make sure that the welfare of students is well catered for, Kgwadi said.The process towards this started sometime last year when the university embarked on a consultation process to get the views of the students on how they want to elect the (SRC).University spokesperson, Koos Degenaar, said that this will help the university to get what the students want. We have sent out SMSs to all our students in three campuses. We want to get their views on what suitable method can be used to elect student leaders. University management and student leaders would like to hear their opinions through a consultation process. Vice-chancellor Prof Kgwadi and the management came up with this consultation process as part of transformation. There is a link to follow and let their voices be heard.This is a new approach, and is part of the restructuring process at the university, Degenaar said.He pointed out that the initiative did not come up as a response to the arson attack of February 2016 when the administration block and science centre were burnt to the ground by students reportedly in protest at the disbandment of the student leadership structure.The damage was valued at R150m.Students have been calling for transformation at the North West University.Some of the students spoken to said that they wanted Afrikaans to be substituted as medium of communication at Potchefstroom campus and be replaced by English.They also mentioned that infrastructure at two campuses, Vaal and Mafikeng needs to meet the same standard as Potchefstroom.ELFAS TORERAIelfast@thenewage.co.za
