Manchester United striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic is refusing to rest on his laurels after becoming the oldest player to net 15 goals in a Premier League season when he scored in Sunday&#8217;s 3-0 win at Leicester City.The 35-year-old has shrugged off suggestions he may struggle to adapt to the pace and intensity of the English game, scoring 20 goals in all competitions since moving to Old Trafford on a free transfer in July.&#8220;I have a target in my head but I will not say it, and we are not there yet,&#8221; Ibrahimovic, who is also the first United player to reach the 20-goal mark since Robin van Persie did in the 2012-13 season, told British media.United are unbeaten in their last 15 league games and sit sixth in the table, just two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal, who hold the final Champions League qualification spot, after 24 games.When asked if his side were back in the hunt for the Champions League places, Ibrahimovic said: &#8220;I think so. It was a big gap a few months ago but it is smaller now. I think we are our own enemy.&#8220;If we had won our games and got the points we should have got then the situation would be totally different but okay, we look at the other teams and hopefully they lose points.&#8221;United host 10th-placed Watford on Saturday.-Reuters
