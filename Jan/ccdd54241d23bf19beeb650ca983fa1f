Lala Motsumi, an unemployed father of four who lives in Boitumelong Township, Bloemhof, is overjoyed by the many changes he has experienced in his life since the bucket system was replaced with a flushing toilet in his home. For 10 years I have been collecting water very far from the house or else knock on people s doors asking for water and sanitation facilities. As a father and husband I felt embarrassed and people would get irritated when I asked to use the toilet but today since I have water and sanitation facilities in my own yard, my kids and wife are happy and safe.They have since learnt to practice safe hygiene. It was also bad when I had visitors and I had to ask neighbours for sanitation facilities for them , he said,According to the Sustainable Development Goals, target number six, everyone should have access to toilet or sanitation facilities by 2030 because the reality is that human waste pollutes and endangers our environment, water resources and our health.Serious waterborne diseases such as cholera and diarrhoea occur when open defecation or poor sanitation is disregarded because of people s desperation.Recently, a total of 621 bucket toilets in Lekwa Teemane and Matlosana local municipalities were replaced with waterborne toilets by the Department of Water and Sanitation.South Africa has accelerated the provision of water, hygiene and sanitation services for restoring dignity for all.The Department of Water and Sanitation in collaboration with the Department of Health has elevated discussions and awareness around sanitation issues.Bloemhof resident, Ms Pulane Motsweneng, a pensioner who suffers from arthritis said that she has been without sanitation facilities in her yard for a very long time.She lived in fear because she didn t have a safe clean flushing toilet. Most women suppress urination for a long time in a bid to access a clean and safe toilet which normally leads to kidney and bladder diseases. Women have different needs than men hence their need to locate a private and clean public sanitation facility but unfortunately they normally face the risk of being abused and raped. This also applies to people with disabilities and children, she said.As part of its mandate, the Department of Water and Sanitation has joined the dialogue in creating a safer South Africa for everyone particularly women and children. This includes the need to start dialogue about the importance of toilets to break the stigma associated with it.While the department s responsibility is to provide clean water and dignified sanitation services, residents can also play a role in creating a clean environment around them to prevent the spread of diseases.Concern has been that nowadays, most of the sanitation facilities have become baby diaper changing areas and bins for disposing sanitary pads.Of course our sanitation facilities should be kept clean at all times and children should not be left to defecate anywhere in their yards, with the notion that children s poop is clean or is germ free. iIt is wrong!Children should learn from an early stage about the importance of using the toilet and why it should be kept clean always.When cleaning toilets, it is important to also do the same for children s toilet seats. No one likes to clean toilets but we still have to do it. Germs love a humid environment to breed in and this task is not for women alone. Men are able to do it as well.Recently South Africans celebrated Global Hand Washing Day as part of the department s Sanitation Campaign, where members of the public were encouraged to make washing of hands with soap and water a habit. This goes a long way in preventing the spread of diseases to others around us.KATLEGO MOKAILAKatlego Mokaila is the Communications Manager in the Department of Water and Sanitation, North West Region
