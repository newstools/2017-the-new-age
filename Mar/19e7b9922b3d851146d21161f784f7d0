Teboho Primary School in QwaQwa walked away as the big winner at the annual Baswa le Meetse provincial competition at Bon Hotel Central, Bloemfontein, at the weekend.The school won first prize in two categories, namely poster and drama and received R20000 in prize money.The prize also included a chance to represent the province in the national competition in July in Mpumalanga.Principal John Moletsane said his school worked really hard in preparing for this competition and the results were now showing.He said they had been participating in this competition for several years without any success. Since the school started participating in the competition, our water bill has reduced significantly as we now know the importance of water in QwaQwa and the surrounding areas. We are representing the province in Mpumalanga and we will win. We want to come back with the final prize, Moletsane said.Nelisiwe Mbele, a 12-year-old pupil at the school, said she was elated to have travelled to Bloemfontein as it was first time she had stepped out of her village to visit a big city. I am happy and excited about the opportunity given to us by the department for the Baswa le Meetse programme that taught us how to save water. We focused on sales, environment and health. Collecting plastics is part of keeping our areas clean which is good for the environment, Mbele said.The Baswa le Meetse, or youth in water competition, aimed at pupils in Grade 6 to showcase their skills and knowledge in water and sanitation.The competition begins at district level and winners proceed to provincial level and then later represent the province at national level.Other schools who performed beyond expectations were Lebohang Primary School which won first position in music followed by Namanyana Primary School in poetry and Ikgwantlelle Primary School in praise.Winners took home R10000 for first position, R8000 for second and R6000 for third positions in all categories.Winners at national level will get R20000 coming first, R15000 for position second and R10000 for third place.Departmental spokesperson Marcus Monyakeni said the competition started at district level and winners proceeded to provincial levels.The competition is adjudicated by members of the Department of Sports Arts and Recreation.MICHAEL TLHAKUDIprovinces@thenewage.co.za
