The poor form shown by the Springboks last year could be the reason for the muted excitement and limited expectations ahead of the new Super Rugby season that kicked off yesterday.That too could be a massive mistake as not many people took the Lions seriously last season, only for Johan Ackermann s side to go straight to the final and give the Springboks a number of good players.This season is expected to be another that could drive where the Boks go and if they improve or not. The return of Handre Pollard from injury, who has since been selected as the Bulls new captain, is a reason for excitement, while Siya Kolisi leading the Stormers is another moment to behold.Despite all that, though, it will be the rugby on the field that will bring fans to the stadiums and for people to continue rallying behind a Bok team that is facing uncertainly in terms of its coaching staff.As the season starts, South Africa will witness two massive derbies whene the Stormers host the Bulls at Newlands tomorrow night at 7.30pm, while the Lions have a date with the Cheetahs tomorrow at 3.30pm.The Sharks, who are in Australia, will kick things off at the Suncorp Stadium against the Reds at 11am this morning, with the Kings completing the local team fixtures with a match against the Jaguares at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium.Bok lock Lood de Jager will make his debut for the Bulls against the Stormers.Mmasekepe Matsebane | mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
