As VARSITY Cup celebrates a decade of the competition s existence, Varsity Sports CEO Duitser Bosman says the tournament has not only been a success but has managed to make a positive contribution to South African rugby.Since the first tournament in 2008, Varsity Cup has produced a number of players who have landed provincial contracts with some going on to represent national teams.The tournament provided 15 players to the Junior Boks squad for the World Rugby U-20 Championships in England last year.The tournament has helped unearth and nurture top players such as Springbok Sevens star Seabelo Senatla, who was named 2016 World Rugby Sevens player of the year.The 10th edition of the tournament kicks off on Monday with four matches taking place at different venues.Defending champions North West University kick off their campaign against University of Johannesburg in an away game. I think we are quite blessed going to the 10th year of the competition with fantastic support from the sponsors and that of the universities embracing the tournament, Bosman said. I think the beauty is that we have positively contributed to South African rugby and also the positive contribution made to sports in the country in general by Varsity Sports in other codes. Bosman said it was a good thing that the universities taking part in the tournament have started to take the Varsity Cup more seriously. The universities are actually investing in the infrastructure, investing in intellectual property. They are getting proper coaches, top psychologists, scientists and flying all over the country recruiting players and developing them.The new season will see former Springbok hooker Tiaan Liebenberg coach Central University of Technology (CUT).He replaces Skillie Bester, who guided the side from Varsity Shield in 2014 and helped CUT remain in the top tier.Varsity Cup Monday Fixtures:Wits v Shimlas, Wits Rugby stadiumTuks v Maties, Loftus VersveldIkeys v Madibaz, Florida ParkUJ v NWU-Puk, UJ stadiumSITHEMBISO DINDIsithembisod@thenewage.co.za
