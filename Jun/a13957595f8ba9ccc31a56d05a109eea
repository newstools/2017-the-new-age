THE North Gauteng High Court has ordered Brian Molefe to stay away from Eskom for purposes of performing his employment duties.Lawyers for the DA and Molefe agreed that Molefe will not attend work at the Eskom head office or at any of the Eskom sites, subject to the completion of his Labour Court matter.This order was given yesterday after the DA s urgent application to review Molefe s reappointment to Eskom as CEO. Molefe s lawyer, Barry Farber, confirmed the DA and EFF matter was postponed by consent. It was postponed pending the outcome of the Labour Court hearing which will hopefully take place soon, Farber said. The court ordered that the matter be postponed pending the Labour Court application of which the date has not yet been set.The matter was supposed to be heard on Monday but both parties had not filed papers. Molefe indicated on Sunday that he was hauling both the Public Enterprises minister and the Eskom board to court to challenge his removal as Eskom CEO.He argues that his dismissal was politically motivated.nondumkisoz@thenewage.co.zaNONDUMISO ZWANE
