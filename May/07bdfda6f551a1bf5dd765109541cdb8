Bidvest Wits coach Gavin Hunt believes a positive mindset will help The Students overcome hoodoo team Free State Stars. Wits visit Ea Lla Koto in an important clash for both sides at the Goble Park Stadium tonight at 7.30pm.They desperately need the points for different reasons as Stars fight relegation while the Clever Boys look to win a first league title. Wits defeated Maritzburg United 1-0 at the weekend to remain top of the PSL table. Stars are third from the bottom of the log with 23 points, one point from the relegation zone. Ea Lla Koto are one of the top -tier teams that always give the Clever Boys a tough time.Though Wits claimed a victory when they last met Stars in December, the Clever Boys had failed to beat the Bethlehem outfit in seven league outings before that. Ea Lla Koto also booted Wits out of the Telkom Knockout this season, crushing their hopes of winning a second trophy in the season after their MTN 8 success. I have been going there for 35 years, I know what it s like, Hunt said. We will go there with a positive mind frame, they are a hard side to play there. They are fighting for their lives, we are fighting for the title at the top of the table. So it won t be an easy game. We are under no illusions over what we expect there. Wits victory over Maritzburg meant they continue to enjoy a three-point lead over rivals Mamelodi Sundowns and are five points above third-placed Cape Town City.Both rivals won their matches at the weekend to make sure that they keep themselves in the race for the league honours. It s going to be like that until the end. I ve said this before: if you look at their run-in and our run-in, I don t think that they should be losing any games and we have games that are going to be tough. Sundowns and City are going to be fighting until the death, there is no doubt about it. I think with these results now, Chiefs can t catch us and I don t think they can catch Sundowns. -SITHEMBISO DINDI|sithembisod@thenewage.co.za
