Jennifer Lopez is starting off 2017 on the right foot, with the launch of her high-end shoe collaboration set for later this month.The star&#8217;s debut footwear collection with Italian designer Giuseppe Zanotti, christened #GiuseppexJennifer, will hit the brand&#8217;s website and stores on January 23, it has been revealed.Comprising six different designs, the glamorous collection channels the singer and actress&#8217;s flashy personal style. The star piece looks set to be a pair of lace-up, bejeweled stiletto boots in metallic silver teased by the brand, although there is also a pair of gladiator sandals included in the series. Photos released by the star in July, when the announcement was made, saw her trying on a pair of knee-high snakeskin-heeled sandals.The project marks Zanotti&#8217;s first major celebrity collaboration, but it is also Lopez&#8217;s first high-end fashion series to date, following a long-standing partnership with the budget retailer Kohl&#8217;s, who she designed her first collection for back in 2011. It kicks off what is sure to be a big year for the star, who is reported to have a music collaboration with rapper Drake in the works, as well as a Spanish-language album. Her Las Vegas residency show &#8220;All I Have&#8221; will run through October and the second season of her TV show &#8220;Shades of Blue&#8221; will premiere on NBC in March.-Relaxnews
