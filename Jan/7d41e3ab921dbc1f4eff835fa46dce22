With embattled provincial education officials racing against time to deliver stationery to schools, pupils in Modimolle are staying away from classes until the process is complete.July Langa, a parent living in Phagameng, said his two children aged 10 and 17 had been coming back early from school since Monday. I asked them on Wednesday why they are coming home early and they told me certain adults and pupils ordered them not to come to school until the department brings all stationery, Langa said. Several sources in the area confirmed that pupils in uniform were loitering in the streets and shops.Provincial department spokesperson Naledzani Rasila, had not responded to The New Age enquiry at the time of going to print. But earlier, the department said it was working around the clock, including weekends, to ensure that all schools have stationery by the end of this month.MEC Ishmael Kgetjepe conceded that stationery was not procured on time but said considerable progress was made in delivering to schools. Meanwhile, schools in the Tshitale area in Vhembe have not opened since December holidays as residents demand tar roads.At least three schools, water affairs offices and other public properties, have been torched in the area since schools reopened last week The South African Schools Act defines the disruption of schools as a criminal activity and government will not hesitate to open cases with police against those who believe that strength of protest is dependent on school disruption, provincial government spokesperson Phuti Seloba, said.-Montsho Matlala|montshom@thenewage.co.za
