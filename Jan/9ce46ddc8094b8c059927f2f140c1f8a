Engineers are not impressed with government expenditure on infrastructure. According to the PPS Graduate Professional Index ,among 400 South African engineers , indicated that only 4% of the respondents believed that the government was effectively delivering on its promises on infrastructure spend.Technical marketing specialist at PPS Motshabi Nomvethe said that 91% of the respondents indicated they did not think that the government would meet its infrastructure objectives as set out in the National Development Plan (NDP). In the NDP, the government states that by 2030 key services such as commercial transport, energy, telecommunications and water must be strengthened to ensure long term sustainability.Vaughan Rimbault, CEO of the South African Institution of Mechanical Engineering, said proactive collaboration between the government and engineering professionals to counter these issues was needed. The government is the biggest potential client for any engineering company, so when massive construction projects are rolled out it is vital that engineers with the right engineering skills are chosen to do these projects, Rimbault said. Improved collaboration between the government and engineering associations will facilitate communication and in turn encourage support from these professionals to have more faith in the government s infrastructure expenditure. Rimbault said the government also had a responsibility to employ local South African businesses to handle these big projects rather than employing skills from overseas.When it comes to employment, Nomvethe said 36% of the survey respondents were concerned that unemployment in the country would encourage skilled professionals to work overseas. Engineers should consider moving into positions within the small and medium sized enterprises in South Africa as an alternative, he said. A small manufacturing company might need a professional to give input on their systems.Seasoned engineers will be able to contribute greatly to these types of businesses, which in turn will allow South African businesses to improve their revenue through improved systems. -Thelma Ngoma|thelman@thenewage.co.za
