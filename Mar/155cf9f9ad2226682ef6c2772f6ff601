Deputy Tourism Minister Tokozile Xasa has said the tourism sector can only succeed when it is a priority at all three levels of government.Xasa said that there was still space for tourism to grow at a municipal level saying that if the country gets it right, the sector will flourish and change the lives of many South Africans.She was speaking at a workshop in Pretoria this week ahead of the local government tourism conference at Emperors Palace in Kempton Park, Johannesburg, next week.Over 500 delegates are expected to gather at the conference.The deputy minster hailed the tourism sector as one of South Africa s biggest success stories since the dawn of democracy, saying it continues to grow while providing a livelihood for many people.She however pointed out that growth was needed on all three levels of government. Tourism should not be in a separate plan, but should be incorporated in all provincial and municipal growth and development strategies. Only then will we build a strong and thriving sector which will grow the economy and create jobs, the deputy minster said.Xasa said the conference would assist municipalities with integrated planning.The deputy minister said it was the responsibility of everyone to develop tourism.Xasa said the tourism sector supported about 1.5 million jobs directly and indirectly in the country. As a key driver of the country s economy, tourism has the potential to turn around the well-being of ordinary South Africans by stimulating equitable participation into mainstream tourism initiatives, she said.Xasa said she strongly believed that this year s local government tourism conference would be a success and that it would give local government the push it needed to go from strength to strength. We would be failing in our duty as the government if we also do not ensure that as we seek to include society in the tourism mainstream that the most vulnerable members of our societies are also brought along on this journey of growth, Xasa said.leratod@thenewage.co.za
