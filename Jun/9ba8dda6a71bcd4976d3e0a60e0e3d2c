He was also attacked by a mob but police were quick to come to his rescue.Matye s picture went viral on social networks and since then, he said, he had been living in fear. He said he could not even walk around his own neighbourhood. Wherever I go, I don t feel safe and I don t know how to clear my name because I m all over social networks.No one trusts me and that pains my heart. I can t go anywhere, I have to stay in the house because I fear being attacked. No one has bothered to clear my name on social media, Matye said. National police spokesperson Maj-Gen Sally de Beer has condemned this behaviour saying perpetrators might be prosecuted. We have noticed lately that there has been a definite increase in hoaxes on social media and false information. We would like to warn social media users to be responsible. It s fine to use social media for awareness but you can t use it as an emergency number or to register a case. We call upon people to be responsible and keep in mind that there can be serious repercussions and the police can even take criminal or civil action against those who knowingly post false or reckless information.
