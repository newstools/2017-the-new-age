People from different churches under the banner of the SA Council of Churches (SACC) marched to the Polokwane police station on Saturday to protest against human trafficking in the province and the country at large.The SACC said cases of human trafficking and prostitution were on the rise in the province and it was now a gateway to the SADC region. Some protesters gagged their mouths with red cloths while others sang hymns.They held placards with messages that said Stop trafficking of people now and Say no to human trafficking . It is a God-given and inalienable right of everyone to live in such a way that his or her dignity is upheld. The government should help victims of human trafficking to be rehabilitated , the marchers, who urged police to arrest perpetrators of such offences, said.Acting station commander of Polokwane police station Col Lucas Thlako thanked the church members and pastors for submitting the memorandum peacefully. As police management we appreciate churches, pastors and bishops for breaking the silence against human trafficking. Let us make sure that we do not keep quiet when these illegal activities are happening in our communities, Thlako said.No statistical records of human trafficking incidents in the province were immediately available during the march.In a recent case, a 25-year-old suspected human trafficker, who was found with four Zimbabwean captives at his house at Chebeng village outside Polokwane, will apply for bail in the Seshego Magistrate s Court on Thursday.Raymond Sithole, a South African national, was arrested by the Hawks early this year following information that four Zimbabwean youths were locked in his house. The four Zimbabweans, aged between 15 and 20, were allegedly smuggled into the country with false promises of good jobs and better lives in South Africa. But we found them under lock and key at the hands of the suspect. They were allegedly forced to steal and to work for the suspect without payment while being brutally assaulted if they did not comply with his instructions, Hawks provincial spokesperson Capt Matimba Maluleke said.Police have appealed to anyone with information on suspicious illegal activities to come forward.MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
