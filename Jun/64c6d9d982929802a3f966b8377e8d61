Zenit St Petersburg appointed former Inter Milan coach Roberto Mancini as its new manager on Thursday after failing to qualify for the Champions League for the second year in a row.Zenit, which finished third in the Russian Premier League, said in a statement the club had signed the 52-year-old Italian on a three-year contract with the possibility of a two-year extension.A source familiar with the contract told Reuters that Mancini would be making 4.5 million euros ($5 million) a year.Mancini is one of the highest-profile foreign coaches to join the Russian Premier League in recent years.Zenit, which is bankrolled by Russian energy giant Gazprom , has used its deep pockets to attract pricey foreign managers in the past, including Dick Advocaat, Luciano Spalletti and Andre Villas-Boas.Mancini has coached a number of elite sides including Inter Milan, Galatasaray and Manchester City.In 2012 Mancini led Man City to the club&#8217;s first English Premier League title in 44 years.He parted ways with Inter Milan last summer after two seasons as head coach, ending his second stint as manager of the Serie A side.Zenit said last week it had fired Romanian trainer Mircea Lucescu after one season with the club, without providing a reason for his dismissal.-Reuters
