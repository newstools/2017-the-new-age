A Gauteng girl is currently in hospital receiving medical attention following an incident where a fellow learner poured boiling water on at school leaving her with third-degree burns across her body.The incident took place last week Thursday at Buhlebemfundo Secondary School in Tsakane a township located in Ekurhuleni.Gauteng Department of Education Acting Head of Communications, Oupa Bodibe confirmed the incident involving two Grade 10 girl learners, aged 16 and 18 years old.It is alleged that an argument ensued between the two learners which led to a 16-year-old pouring hot water on a fellow learner.@Lesufi when u r busy defending this criminals at school 1 of them poured hot water on this teacher at Buhle be mfundo in Tsakani East Rand pic.twitter.com/U7H904899g Stash Mawila (@MawilaStash) September 18, 2017According to the department, a case of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm has been opened with the Tsakane South African Police Service and the 16-year-old has been released from her parents custody.She has also been suspended from school pending a disciplinary process.School yards are increasingly becoming the setting for serious cases of assault among learners themselves as well as teachers meant to be their guardians during the day.Late last year a video of three learners from Moletsane Secondary School in Soweto manhandling their teacher caused an outrage. The three were later suspended.This year Gauteng MEC for Education Panyaza Lesufi has also had to grapple with violence between learners. He had to step in at Norkem Park High in Kempton Park after multiple fights at the school including an incident where a learner was stabbed with a pair of scissors during a fight.The constant stream of violence has led to Lesufi proposing mandatory drug testing for learners seeking high school admission.Last month the Department announced a proposal to amend Section 8A of the South African Schools Act to allow schools to conduct random searches, seizures and drug testing at schools.-Siphiwe Mchunu
