Telcoms giant Nokia on Thursday said that falling network sales and costs stemming from acquisitions and its integration of Alcatel-Lucent had resulted in a &#8220;disappointing&#8221; loss in 2016. The firm recorded a net loss of 766 million euros ($826 million) last year, which chief executive Rajeev Suri described in a statement as a &#8220;year of transition.&#8221;Suri admitted he was &#8220;disappointed&#8221; with the 2016 results but said he expected a better financial performance this year &#8220;as market conditions improve.&#8221;&#8221;We remain in a position of financial strength,&#8221; said the chief executive.Nokia has been going through a process of radical transformation over the last few years.In 2013, it bought 50 percent of its network activities from Germany&#8217;s Siemens, and the following year it divested from its previously world-leading mobile phone business.It sold its mapping unit Here in 2015 as well as completing the deal late last year to buy Alcatel-Lucent, which had only recorded one year of annual profit since its inception in 2006.Nokia was the world&#8217;s top mobile phone maker between 1998 and 2011 but was overtaken by South Korean rival Samsung after failing to respond to the rapid rise of smartphones .-AFP
