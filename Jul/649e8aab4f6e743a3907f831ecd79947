Twitter Inc heads toward its quarterly earnings report on Thursday with a stock that has risen more than 40 percent since April when much of Wall Street was ready to write off the tech company.The company&#8217;s share price popped after its most recent earnings report in April, when Twitter disclosed better-than-expected user growth.The number of people on Twitter will be in sharp focus on Thursday, when investors and analysts will see if it has kept up the 6 percent year-over-year growth in monthly active users it reported in April. Twitter said then that it had 328 million users.&#8220;For a company that people thought six months ago was knocking on death&#8217;s door and going the way of Myspace and AOL, the double-digit rebound and the continued acceleration in users has really surprised investors,&#8221; BTIG Research analyst Richard Greenfield said.Twitter shares closed on Tuesday at $19.97, nearly flat on the day but up 41.4 percent since its stock hit an intraday low of $14.12 on April 17.The S&amp;P 500 information technology index is up 10.6 percent since its April 17 closing price.The surge of interest is a morale boost for Twitter, which has limped through past earnings announcements, struggled to keep a stable management and suffered unfavorable comparisons to its bigger and more profitable competitor Facebook Inc.This month, Twitter had a streak of 12 days when its shares closed up.The business is expected to report quarterly revenue of $536.6 million, according to a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S forecast average. That would be a drop of 10.9 percent from $602 million a year earlier.What has investors upbeat, though, is the number of people on the service, which public figures including U.S. President Donald Trump use to blast out 140-character messages.&#8220;People are willing to give them the benefit of the doubt if they start to grow again,&#8221; Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said.Other positive signs cited by analysts include co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey purchasing additional shares and co-founder Biz Stone announcing in May his return to Twitter. Ex-banker Ned Segal starts next month as Twitter&#8217;s next chief financial officer.Meanwhile, advertisers and investors have gotten used to Twitter existing as a niche platform, Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser said.&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that,&#8221; he said.-Reuters
