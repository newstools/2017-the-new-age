The public is demanding a police service that is accountable, has integrity, accommodates diversity and adheres to the principles of human rights. Anything less would not be acceptable, according to Francois Beukman, chairperson of the police portfolio committee.He was reacting in a statement on the tabling of the white paper on police in Parliament by Minister of Police Nathi Nhleko yesterday. It was vital that proper public discourse takes place on the content of the white paper. The white paper is an important document to ensure that the vision of a professional police service is realised. The implementation of the recommendations of the National Development Plan needs the urgent attention of all role players in the sector, Beukman said.The portfolio committee would ask the Civilian Secretariat for Police to brief it on the white paper and also on the white paper on safety and security on Wednesday, March 8.He said it was imperative for the South African Police Service to commit to the principles of good governance and citizen participation in the creation of safer communities, as envisaged in the white paper. There is a widening consensus that the public demands a police service that is accountable, has integrity, accommodates diversity and adheres to the principles of human rights. A police service that is community-centred. Anything less would not be acceptable, Beukman said.He said the portfolio committee believed that the much-needed review of the SAPS Act of 1995 could not be delayed any longer. Therefore the portfolio committee would push for this matter to be expedited as a matter of priority.Dennis Cruywagennews@thenewage.co.za
