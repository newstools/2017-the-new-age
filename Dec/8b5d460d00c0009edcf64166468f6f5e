There has been no impact on the supply of electricity as a result of a conveyor belt fire at the Kendal Power Station in Ogies in Mpumalanga, Eskom said on Friday. In a statement, the power utility announced that the fire was detected in an area around the two conveyer belts that supply coal to the power station. Eskom said while the fire had been successfully put out, visible damage was observed on one conveyor belt. “As a precautionary measure, the other conveyor belt will be inspected for damage before being put back into service,” acting group executive Willy Majola said. He thanked the multidisciplinary teams who worked hand-in-hand with the fire and emergency response teams to ensure that the fire was swiftly put out. Majola said the supply of electricity was not impacted as a result of the fire. “In addition, the station has already employed two mobile feeders to augment coal supply while reclaiming from the station’s healthy coal stock pile to ensure continuous generation of electricity,” Majola said. Preliminary investigations revealed it will could about two weeks to get the conveyor belt back into service. Dennis Cruywagen dennisc@thenewage.co.za
