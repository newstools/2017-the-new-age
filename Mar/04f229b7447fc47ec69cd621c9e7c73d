The arrest of our own is both disheartening and pleasing at the same time because this gives us an opportunity to identify the corrupt elements within the system. Other members should draw lessons from this, and this should serve as a deterrence within our organisation to those officials who may be involved in corrupt-related activities, said Phahlane.Phahlane also applauded the team for effecting the arrests of their own colleagues, with a view of uprooting criminality within the organisation. #sapsHQ Lt Gen Khomotso #Phahlane welcomes arrest of 10 #SAPS officers in Free State for alleged corruption.
