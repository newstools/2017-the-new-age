Eight students are being held in custody in Togo after campus protests over teaching conditions turned violent, a student association told AFP on Monday.&#8220;In total, eight students are still being detained after some were released over the weekend,&#8221; said Honore Agoudzo, head of the student group Meet.A number of the students&#8217; parents also confirmed their children were being held. Police said they had taken them in for questioning, without specifying numbers.Students clashed with police last Wednesday, Thursday and Friday on campus in the capital Lome, following a rally of the Togolese students rights league (LTDE).According to the authorities at the University of Lome, permission for the protest was not given and the LTDE was not a group permitted to have on-campus events.Police broke-up the gathering by firing teargas.The students were demanding that new classrooms be built as well as an increase in monthly allowances from 12,000 CFA francs to 20,000 CFA francs ($21-$34, 18-30 euros).The Togolese human rights league (LTDH) condemned what it said was the &#8220;barbaric, primitive, defamatory and uncivilised repression&#8221; of certain students.It called on the university authorities to respect &#8220;public freedoms and freedom of expression&#8221; on campus.&#8220;Videos show particularly barbaric and horrible scenes of police savagely beating students and dragging them across the ground,&#8221; it said in a statement.-AFP
