If you&#8217;ve been away for the holidays and just returned to Durban, be sure to catch a glimpse of Belinda Davids singing some of Whitney Houston s greatest love songs this weekend.The Sibaya Casino has in the past few weeks played host to Port Elizabeth-born Davids, who has been serenading music lovers with Whitney Houston s timeless classics. The show, which began at the Izulu Theatre on December 9, wraps up on Sunday after it was staged more than a dozen times. Davids Pretoria State Theatre performances have, however, after more than a year of anticipation, been cancelled. The Greatest Love of All was supposed to have taken place at the State Theatre from Tuesday, January 26, to Sunday, February 14, giving hopeful romantics enough time to savour Valentine s Day. Davids will wrap up her SA tour with a Cape Town performance on June 17 at the Artscape Opera House. The singer, who dances and sings like Houston, is always accompanied by a live band, as well as dancers who add a sprinkle of razzmatazz to the stage. Houston fans in Durban have been getting down to singalongs such as How Will I Know, I Wanna Dance With Somebody, Where Do Broken Hearts Go, Didn t We Almost Have It All and I m Every Woman. The singing sensation has received rave reviews for her performances in Dubai, New Zealand and the US. Davids entered a competition with 15 000 other hopefuls to portray Whitney Houston. She won the hearts of the judges and Showtime Australia, the management company behind the show, spent more than a year perfecting the production. Showtime visited 12 countries to find the ideal candidate to bring Houston s music back to life. SIYABONGA SITHOLE siyabongas@thenewage.co.za &nbsp;
