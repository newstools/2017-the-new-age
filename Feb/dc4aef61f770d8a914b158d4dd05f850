German firm ATM Holding has acquired a 25% stake in SA s engineering and construction group Murray &amp; Roberts. The announcement of the acquisition led to a surge in Murray &amp; Roberts shares yesterday.ATM is a wholly owned subsidiary of Aton, a private investment holding company headquartered in Germany, with a diverse portfolio of investments in the mining, engineering, aviation and health technology sectors. Aton acquired a 4.49% shareholding between June and September 2015 and now holds 25.5% of Murray &amp; Roberts total share capital.The company has confirmed that it has not received any other correspondence or communication from Aton. M&amp;R said it will now engage with Aton regarding its intentions following the acquisition. M&amp;R said that it held exploratory discussions with Aton between September 2015 and April 2016, regarding a potential combination of Redpath with Murray &amp; Roberts underground mining business platform.Redpath is an underground mining contractor and a wholly owned subsidiary of Aton. The parties failed to reach an agreement on the proposed transaction structure and relative value despite there being merit in the potential combination. Discussions ceased in May when they could not reach an agreement.On Monday, major stakeholders in M&amp;R, Allan Gray and Sanlam, disposed of their interests in the company. Allan Gray reduced its stake to 15.35% of M&amp;R s total shares while Sanlam reduced its stake to 4.87% in the company. Coronation Fund Managers sold its 15% stake last week.Shares in the construction firm increased to a near six-month high, although the company was unaware of the reason for the rise in stock. While shares in M&amp;R increased by 1.3% by 12.05pm, shares in rival construction company Group Five fell nearly 2.9% to R23.32.-Thelma Ngoma|thelman@thenewage.co.za
