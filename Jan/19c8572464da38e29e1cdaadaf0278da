The majority of the Eastern Cape population relies on the public health system as medical aid coverage in the province stands at 12%.Figures show that from the Eastern Cape population of more than 5 million people, about 88% use public hospitals and clinics, including Mthatha Regional Hospital which is one of the major provincial, government-funded hospitals.Mthatha, previously known as Mthatha General Hospital, forms part of the Mthatha hospital complex.The hospital departments include the emergency department, paediatric ward, maternity ward, obstetrics/gynaecology, out-patients department, surgical services, medical services, operating theatre and central sterile services department services, occupational services, X-ray services, physiotherapy, laboratory, oral healthcare, laundry services and kitchen services.The 2011 census data shows that the province has a population of 6 562053.The largest proportions of the population are concentrated at OR Tambo and Nelson Mandela metro districts with 20.8% and 17.6% of the total population respectively falling under the OR Tambo district municipality.Joe Gqabi district has the smallest population, constituting 5.3%. About 61.1% of the population is younger than 30 years and 11.7% of these are under the age of five. Nelson Mandela Drive is the N2 Highway that runs through Mthatha.Another nearby main road is the R61 also running through Mthatha. Mthatha is situated 98.6km south of Mount Frere on the N2 and 83.8km east of Ngcobo on the R61.Mthatha Hospital provides services that are free to pregnant and breastfeeding women as well as children under six years.Other citizens are charged according to a sliding scale depending on their income.After a horrible experience by Zodwa Gobidolo, a resident in Corane Mthatha, the hospital wants to improve its services.Gobidolo said: On the day I was supposed to be operated on and give birth, a doctor in the hospital told me I had to go eLibode. She said I had to make my own way there because they did not have ambulances and they did not have a vacant bed, Gobidolo said.Hospital CEO Thozama Madubela said the reason for making the hospital regional was because they wanted to expand their services to the public. The goal of diverting general to regional is still in progress. There is a paediatric unit that we established in June but some of the units are not fully functioning yet, Madubela said.Madubela said the hospital had a 67% bed occupancy. The hospital has 354 beds, 60 of these beds are for mental health patients. There are about 265 general beds divided into 64 for maternity, 40 for paediatric, 23 for the nurseries, 54 for TB, 42 for medical and 42 surgical beds, Madubela said.She said the other purpose was for more people to be able to access more kinds of medical care at the hospital without being transferred from one hospital to another.A resident, Lelethu Mfana from eKhwezi in Mthatha, is not pleased with the state of the Mthatha hospital.She gave birth six months ago in the hospital and says the hospital was not clean. They wrapped my baby girl in a blanket that was not for babies, it had a very rough texture. But what really hurt me was the nurses who do not seem to care and do not love their jobs and mistreat patients, Mfana said.She said she saw that there were renovations being done but she was not excited because of her bad experience. I am also unhappy because it may take many years for construction and renovations to be carried out, Mfana said.SISANDA MADWANTSInews@thenewage.co.za
