Residents complained that the bad condition of the roads were damaging their vehicles.Local resident Freddy Jacobs said their demand for roads to be fixed was not unreasonable. We are not raising this because we are against the mayor and his council but we are simply asking the municipality to quickly fix our roads. We know these things take time but we are hoping that by speaking out about our concerns, we will be heard. It is difficult to drive around here, Jacobs said.A motorist, who did not want to be named, said councillors and the government were aware of the poor state of the roads, especially in townships. These people are not serious. How can a residential area be like this? It s not only the issue of roads, even our dumping sites are not monitored. Matika said an amount of R115m would be allocated for the next three years to maintain the state of roads in the city.The mayor said roads were one of the projects his office would prioritise in the next financial year as well as housing, substations and infrastructure among others. The intention is to improve the roads leading into the central business district and the upgrade of all major intersections using heavy duty industrial interlocking paving blocks. These blocks are durable and require less maintenance, Matika said.The mayor said his administration was committed to finalising the building of bulk infrastructure, the upgrading of informal settlements and the upgrading of roads and improving governance and institutional capacity. In this process, there will be those who will attempt to distract others from seeing the good we have achieved. Meanwhile, public works and roads MEC Mxolisa Sokatsha is expected in his coming budget vote to outline plans to address poor roads and infrastructure across the province.tiisetsom@thenewage.co.za
