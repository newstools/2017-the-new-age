Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini has criticised the Treasury saying the Finance Minister wanted to hand the billions spent on social grants to banks which could not secure the grants.While questions remained unanswered after Dlamini s press conference about exactly how the SASSA grants will be paid after April 1 and the reasons for the sudden resignation of the Director General Zane Dangor, Dlamini was clear that her department was not prepared to hand over the grants unless certain security provisions were met.Dlamini was speaking at a press conference on Sunday to clarify the process surrounding the payment of 17 million social grants by SASSA after April 1 when the current contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) comes to an end.The contract with CPS has been mired in controversy because the Constitutional Court in 2014 declared the contract invalid but allowed it to continue until new arrangments could be made.On Saturday President Jacob Zuma had emergency meeting with Dlamini and Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and expressed a view that the problems were &#8220;solveable&#8221; but has insisted that the two ministers report back to him. The department is also due to report back to Parliamentary committee on finance (Scopa) this week.Dlamini explained that despite an attempt to put these new contracts into place, this failed because the companies tendering did not have the capacity to ensure that the grants, worth R11 billion a month, be paid. This necessitated a return to the drawing board.The department had taken a legal opinion from Advocate Wim Trengrove which indicated the department could go ahead with a renewed contract with CPS on an emergency procurement basis. However, the service level agreements between Sassa and CPS had not yet been signed for this, it was confirmed.Dlamini said that Treasury had been invited to the negotiations with CPS but &#8220;chose not to come&#8221;.There had been correspondence between the Treasury and the department but there was a fundamental difference in opinion about how to tackle the grants. Dlamini was clear that in order for a bank or other institution to administer the grants it would require biometric controls in place &#8211; which had saved the fiscus R2bn.There would also, she said, a requirement for legislation to be put in place to ensure that government can oversee the grants.The department had in the interim looked at several options which included procuring services from existing service provider, procuring services from a bank to service all beneficiaries, approaching all the banks, asking the SA Post Office to take or getting a brand new supplier.Dlamini refused to answer question on Dangor&#8217;s resignation suffice to say that he was well respected in social development sectors.She moved to assure the public that grants would be paid on April 1, despite the problems and accused the media of sensationalising the story.
