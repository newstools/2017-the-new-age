When at some future date the courts of history judge Parliament, the legislative branch of the state, will they find that our members of Parliament had been men and women of integrity, courage, good conscience and dedication, with loyalty and obedience only to the Constitution of the Republic?The answer lies ultimately in the conduct of our MPs towards their constitutionally vested law-making powers, with specific and particular reference to the contentious Financial Intelligence Centre Amendment Bill.On January 25th, the parliamentary standing committee on finance held public hearings and received submissions on the bill following its referral to Parliament by President Jacob Zuma. A notable submission against the bill was made by the Black Business Council (BBC) together with its affiliate members the Progressive Professionals Forum (PPF).It has been my privilege and pleasure to work with the BBC task team that reviewed the bill and wrote a letter of objection to Zuma as well as in the preparation of the submission the BBC made to Parliament.The BBC is an overarching confederation that represents black professionals, business associations and chambers, with a primary purpose to lobby the government on policy related matters and to play an advocacy role where policies are in place in order to accelerate the participation of black business in the mainstream economy.The BBC made a submission that DA MP David Maynier said was substantive. In its submission, the BBC affirmed its understanding of the supremacy of the Constitution, saying: the Constitution is the supreme law of the republic and any law or conduct that is not consistent with it will be invalid. The obligations imposed by it must be fulfilled. The supremacy clause forms part of the 36 constitutional principles contained in the 1993 Interim Constitution, which constitute the bedrock of the Constitution and is not amendable.During the hearings, the BBC stated its support and welcomed any legislative amendments that were fully compliant with the Constitution to strengthen the combating of money laundering and financing of terrorism. This is a morally correct position in my opinion.The BBC further said Parliament was obliged to ensure all bills that pass through the two Chambers of Parliament are not only textually consistent with the Constitution, but contextually, formatively and substantively advance the basic tenets of equality, human dignity, freedom and social justice.As I listened to the various submissions by other NGOs such as the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution, Business and Arts South Africa, Corruption Watch, the Association of Black Securities and Investment Professionals as well as opinion by legal eagles such as advocate Jeremy Gauntlett SC and advocate Ishmael Semenya SC, I was astonished none of them attempted to legally contest the assertions made by both BBC and PPF that the bill was a dangerous piece of legislation in terms of its adverse impacts on the rule of law, constitutionally protected rights and the health of South Africa s democracy and sovereignty.I share the considered view that money laundering and terrorism financing must be countered in ways that are fully consistent with the core Constitutional values (that include equality, liberty, non-discrimination, and the rule of law) are evidence-based and are likely to be effective, and the bill in its current form is actually counter-productive as it gets in the way of effective policing, intelligence gathering and prosecutorial activity.I find it flabbergasting that the drafters mischievously inserted a provision of prominent influential persons (sometimes referred to as politically exposed persons), which totally eradicates and infringes on the rights of citizens as contained in chapter 2 (bill of rights) of the Constitution.Even more shocking, the bill contains a provision for a risk management and compliance programme which violates the constitutional right to due process and effectively pre-authorises violations of the established sacrosanct legal principle of audi alteram partem, or listening to the other side.This provision of risk management and compliance horrifically pre-authorises violation of the Constitution and the rule of law by transferring criminal investigative, prosecutorial and judicial authority from law enforcement agencies and the independent judiciary into the hands of banking and financial institutions, thus effectively and unconstitutionally vesting banks with the unfettered powers to convict and sentence citizens without any prosecution in a open court. This is an ouster to South Africa s criminal justice system and brings an end to constitutionalism.It is a total mystery to me why the drafters of the bill hoped they could legally hold course on another constitutionally mischievous provision of domestic prominent influential persons (DPIP) which creates a predetermined list of criminal suspects that includes leaders and senior officials in all of the branches of state (legislature, judiciary and executive) as well as directors of private companies that do any business howsoever with any state department or organ. The provision of DPIP in the bill effectively means that at all material times, the President, cabinet and director-generals or the chief justice, judge presidents and chief magistrates or Speaker of the National Assembly, shall have to execute their duties and functions as authorised by the banking and financial institutions. This amounts to total state capture.I find it grossly mischievous that the proponents of this unconstitutional and draconian bill want it signed into law despite the fundamental flaws on the basis of unfounded urgency as though there was a legislative vacuum, when in fact, South Africa has adequate legislation to counter money laundering and terrorism financing in the form of the Financial Intelligence Centre Act of 2001, save for the amendment to provide for Article 52 of the UN Security Council.In view of the various constitutional grounds I have raised, MPs are duty bound to refer to section 2 of the Constitution and not prematurely and unlawful put the President in an invidious and untenable position to sign into law a bill that has been shown to be constitutionally invalid. Let us hope sanity prevails.Tshepo KgadimaTshepo Kgadima is an independent political and economic analyst
