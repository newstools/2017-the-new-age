The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal said it was is disappointed at the lenient sentence given to Dawie Kriel by the Durban Magistrate&#8217;s Court following the racist social media remarks he made about the Hindu community during last year s Diwali celebration.The fine of a mere R6000 or 12 months imprisonment &#8211; suspended for five years was a &#8220;slap on the wrist&#8221; and an insult to the Hindu community.&#8220;We call on the justice system to adopt a sterner approach in dealing with incidents of this nature. We must all consciously work to isolate racism within our societies. As such, the ANC will not celebrate this judgement. This should not be construed as an attack on the judiciary, but an honest call for the judiciary to contribute meaningfully to our nation building and social cohesion campaigns,&#8221; the party said in a statement.-TNA Reporter
