Liberation struggle poet and novelist, Prof Mongane Wally Serote, is set to add another feather to his cap. He will be conferred an honorary doctorate by the University of Johannesburg this evening.Serote who has lectured at universities abroad and in South Africa, leads UJ s postgraduate students in a project to document indigenous knowledge systems at the African Centre for Epistemology and Philosophy of Science. Spending nine months in solitary confinement in an apartheid prison in 1969 and 18 years in exile, Serote s commitment to intervene and disrupt racism in all fields of human agency is evident in his widely-celebrated contribution to the literature and poetry of black identity and resistance, Alex Broadbent, professor of philosophy and the executive dean of the Faculty of Humanities at UJ, said.Broadbent said Serote was a true African intellectual in the tradition of the African philosophic sage, a profoundly wise person. His extensive contributions to the promotion of authentic African cultural expression and his sought-after expertise on indigenous knowledge systems for rebuilding our society, are based on his broad experiential knowledge, participant observation, decades of organisational involvement and service and deep intellectual reflection, Broadbent said.Serote is one of South Africa s best-known poets and novelists.He was born in Sophiatown in 1944. He attended primary school in Alexandra township and high school in Lesotho and Soweto.Detained under the Terrorism Act in 1969, he was released nine months later without being charged.Serote moved to Botswana in 1979 where he co-founded the Medu Arts Ensemble and to London in 1986, where he held a position on the ANC cultural desk. He returned to South Africa in the early 1990s.His novel To Every Birth Its Blood (1981) deals with the 1976 Soweto uprising and its dramatic aftermath and was met with critical acclaim.In 2007, he was awarded the Order of Ikhamanga in silver, for excellent contribution to literature, with emphasis on poetry and for putting his artistic talents at the service of democracy in South Africa . Serote s work deals with socially salient themes over several decades and has achieved considerable influence. His work is often set for school learners. Moreover the message of his work is in line with UJ s commitment to putting talent to work for the service of democratic society, Broadbent said.Serote s early poems introduced the militant voice of Black Consciousness to South African literature and, in their reliance on elements of African oral culture, challenged accepted poetic norms.NTOMBI NKOSIntombin@thenewage.co.za
