Eskom is to sign a R19.78bn loan agreement with China Development Bank tomorrow. Acting CEO Johnny Dladla said last week the state-owned utility had secured 77% of its funding requirements despite tough market conditions. Eskom had for the first time managed to increase its borrowings by more than R60bn in one year, Dladla said. “We remain resolute that we will fully execute the required funding for the year, albeit under challenging market conditions. “Our liquidity levels remain healthy and Eskom’s financial profile continues to improve and stabilise,” Dladla said. He assured the country that Eskom would continue to provide sustainable power supply during “this period of high demand and beyond”. -NONHLANHLA MASEKO|business@thenewage.co.za
