The case against two men arrested in connection with the theft of brand new Ford vehicles at its Phalaborwa branch in Limpopo has been postponed to next year. Tsununu Maphosa, 31 and Mpho Dzuguda, 23, appeared in the Musina Magistrate’s Court on Monday where their case was moved to the Masisi Periodical Court on Tuesday. Their case was postponed in order for them to obtain legal representation. The two were arrested after they were found with two of the cars, which were stolen on Saturday morning. According to Limpopo police spokesperson Robert Netshiunda, Maphosa was the driver in one of the recovered vehicles while Dzuguda was a passenger in another. “Both of them are facing a charge of possession of a suspected stolen vehicle,” Netshiunda said. Netshiunda said Dzuguda was allegedly paid a sum of money to aid the suspects to navigate through the villages and access the Limpopo River. Meanwhile, a search is still on for eleven 11more suspects and one outstanding vehicle, a white Ford RangerWildtrack. Anyone with information is urged to contact Investigating Officer Warrant Officer Makhani at 082 565 7842, crime stop at 08600 10111 or SMS crime Line on 32211. -TNA Reporter
