SOME African National Congress (ANC) stalwarts and veterans have added their voices to the call for President Jacob Zuma to quit.Speaking at a briefing in Johannesburg yesterday, ANC veteran Murphy Morobe, said the current crisis has left them with no choice but to call on Zuma to be recalled because this is about the rights of all South Africans, not just the ANC. There is something terribly wrong with the ANC and the only honourable thing is to recall the president so that we can rebuild the organisation, Morobe said. We will continue to engage with the ANC for consultative conference to be delinked, we support disciplined and principled action and we will also resolve to establish a council of elders to meet with ANC top 6. We have a crisis and it is a serious crisis. What has made things worse is the cabinet reshuffle, another veteran Frank Chikane, said.Former deputy secretary general and now businessperson Cheryl Carolus said that they were very shocked with the reshuffle and that Zuma has just crossed the line . This has never happened in the history of the ANC where one person, who is president, can defy his comrades, she said.Carolus believes that Zuma only recalled Gordhan to humiliate him, as he was advised to also fire Faith Muthambi and Bathabile Dlamini. Muthambi and Dlamini s performance should have been looked at, she said.The stalwarts and veterans also criticised Zuma for allegedly not personally conveying his condolences to the family of Ahmed Kathrada who passed away last week. It is unheard of that Zuma did not even call the Kathrada family to offer condolences, Chikane said.Meanwhile, ANC veteran Wally Serote, said during the meeting they held this morning, the stalwarts agreed to hold the consultative conference. He said they were shocked following their last meeting when some ANC leaders said the party never agreed to the conference. TNA Online
