Egyptian police have killed four suspected Islamist militants believed to have been planning a &#8220;major attack&#8221; in a shootout near Cairo, the interior ministry said.The &#8220;takfiri&#8221; cell ,an Arabic word for extremists who declare other Muslims disbelievers ,had been meeting when police raided their hideout in Giza province, southwest of Cairo, the ministry said in a statement on Friday.&#8220;When the terrorist cell sensed the police drawing near they began shooting at them, which prompted the police force to fire back,&#8221; the statement said.The suspects&#8217; affiliation was not immediately clear but police often describe jihadists with links to the Islamic State group or Al-Qaeda as &#8220;takfiris&#8221;.They were &#8220;preparing to execute a major attack in the coming period,&#8221; the statement said.The Islamic State group&#8217;s Egyptian branch has killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers in attacks, mostly in the Sinai Peninsula but also in Cairo.The country has witnessed a deadly insurgency since the military overthrew Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013 and police cracked down on his Muslim Brotherhood movement, killing hundreds of protesters.-AFP
