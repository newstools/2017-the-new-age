At least 30 people were killed and dozens more hurt in a giant landslide of garbage at Ethiopia&#8217;s largest rubbish dump on the outskirts of the capital Addis Ababa, a city official said Sunday.An AFP journalist at the scene said the largest pile of rubbish at the Koshe landfill appeared to have collapsed, triggering Saturday&#8217;s tragedy that levelled dozens of homes of squatters living there.&#8220;The death toll is now 30,&#8221; said Dagmawit Moges, head of the city communications bureau.He said many of the victims were squatters who scavenged for a living in the dump.&#8220;We expect the number of victims to increase because the landslide covered a relatively large area,&#8221; he added.The Koshe site has for more than 40 years been one of the main garbage dumps for Addis Ababa, a rapidly growing city of some four million people in the east African country.-AFP
