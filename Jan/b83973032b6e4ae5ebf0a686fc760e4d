North West police department says the Back2Basics approach is being used to enhance police visibility, deployment of resources and consultative approach to policing.Police spokesperson Brig Sabata Mokgwabone said their strategies are guided by crime pattern and threat analyses.Mokgwabone said that the Back2Basics strategy was working well to curb crime and they had managed to bust two major drug laboratories. Last year a police officer refused a bribe of R60000 offered upon the discovery of what appeared to be a drug manufacturing laboratory in Boons near Rustenburg where a 54-year-old woman who owns the property where the laboratory was discovered was arrested for attempting to bribe the police. He said the arrest came after the police who were on a rural safety patrol stopped at the locked gates at one of the farms in Boons. They managed to force entry into the farm where they discovered that drugs manufacturing activities were taking place.Drugs sludge was found being cooked on stoves while others were still in various drums. The police also found drugs suspected to be Mandrax as well as other chemicals used to manufacture drugs, all worth an estimated street value of R8m.The drug laboratory was the second major drug success in the province following the one in which the police in Kopfontein port of entry found drugs worth R70m hidden in a false compartment of a truck that was entering South Africa from Botswana.Mokgwabone said the crime pattern analysis is the intelligence gleaned by the police which informs the modus operandi of criminals and is used in the planning of operations. What is important to note is that crime is dealt with by the police in a conventional and non-conventional manner as no two crimes are the same and there are varied causes of crime hence classification of crime, Mokgwabone said.He said that there are crimes referred to as social fabric crimes and it is these crimes where social crime prevention strategies or partnerships between the police, the community and other stakeholders are encouraged. For example community or sector policing, neighbourhood watches, rural safety strategy etc, he said. There are also violent as well as organised transnational crimes which require an organised approach. Mokgwabone said that it is these two main crime that not only inform the strategies to use but also which unit is better equipped to address a particular crime. For example, stock theft, cash-in-transit heists, aggravated robberies, public violence, fraud and so on. When addressing these crimes and due to the seriousness and the high threat levels involved, operations/strategies involved only select specialised units and are confidential, Mokgwabone said.The police in the province strongly believe that crime prevention is not a police responsibility but a societal responsibility that requires everybody s active participation so that the National Development Plan goals of making sure that all are and feel safe by the year 2030 are realised.Policing strategies are therefore informed by and also in line with the government s programme of action, in particular Vision 2030 or the NDP.The North West department of community safety and transport management said its mandate includes providing effective coordination of crime prevention initiatives and provincial police oversight.DIKELEDI RAMABOPAprovinces@thenewage.co.za
