Chickens are coming home to roost regarding the government s taxi recapitalisation programme which was endorsed four years ago and the taxi industry is taking its frustration to the street which, in turn, impacts heavily on the ailing economy.Under the recapitalisation programme, taxi operators were paid a sum of money to scrap their vehicles and buy new ones. Most were given R50000 for impounding their vehicles and buying new.However, the operators have since complained that they were not paid enough to help finance new mini buses, and now the bomb is starting to tick with the deal that was concluded four years back with SA Taxi Finance falling apart.Last week the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) embarked on a crippling go-slow strike which brought traffic to a standstill on Africa s busiest freeway, the Ben Schoeman.The taxi association was demanding that the interest charged on their Quantum minibuses of 28% a year be reduced significantly.Some commentators said the government was warned when embarking on the taxi recap process and that now the chickens are coming home to roost, signalling a failed Vision 2020.Vision 2020 is aiming at promoting a safe, reliable, effective, efficient, coordinated, integrated and environmentally friendly public transport system by developing norms and standards as well as regulations and legislation to guide the development of public transport for rural and urban passengers.But the taxi industry does not benefit from ownership while the other transport projects such as Gautrain, Rea Vaya and Tshwane s R2bn A Re Yeng BRT are not benefiting the working poor.The bulk of the profit still goes to companies at the expense of the poor.With 69% of all South African households utilising minibus taxis, this dominant mode of transport is responsible for more than 15 million commuter trips a day, yet there is no government subsidy.Taxi drivers say they have to work crippling hours before they start earning for themselves as the taxi owners are also stretched to the limit with exorbitant monthly bank repayments and other costs escalating relentlessly.The car finance arm of SA Taxi Finance, charges 28% interest on a Quantum minibus that generally retails at about R450000 so most taxi owners ended up paying close to R1m on a principal debt of R400000 and that is excluding balloon payments that have to be made when they sell the vehicle.Bloomberg News said Transactional Capital s March financial results showed they give four times more car loans than all four big banks put together, including Capitec and that the reason for the high charges could be linked to the nature of the finance plan that has similar features to unsecured loans .In other words, the interest rates go up because of the risk of financing an expensive, moveable asset that in any event loses value every day and with every kilometre driven.As a result, taxi fleet owners and their drivers are challenging the country s biggest minibus vehicle finance scheme to charge them reasonable fees.For the three-year period from January 2014 to December 2016, Toyota increased the price of its minibus taxi vehicle by an average 8.7% a year, to a current price of about R400000. One of the key reasons why taxi owners feel that SA Taxi Finance is milking them, is the fact that many of the customers are now using the Gautrain, Rea Vaya and Tshwane s R2.6bn A Re Yeng BRT system.Further, the high rate of unemployment is a major blow to the industry.The pie that the taxi industry has been carving up among itself for decades has shrunk as more transport modes are introduced, heavily subsidised at that and commuters have more choice.In addition, the issue of petrol prices and high maintenance costs of minibus taxis are not to be sneezed at.In its interim financial results as of March 31, SA Taxi Finance reported healthy figures, including: 16% growth in gross loans and advances stable net interest margins 30% growth in non-interest revenue improving credit performance and a marginally higher cost-to-income ratio and 22% growth in headline earnings of R144m for the period.Clearly, SA Taxi Finance is doing well.Some analysts say that with its huge volumes (four times that of all the other commercial banks), it can provide taxi owners with a better deal than the 3% interest cute it offered after the protest action. The government should revisit its public transport programmes and make sure they are owned by a black majority rather than foreign nationals. The taxi industry has been hobbled because of outdated laws, said one analyst.bernards@thenewage.co.za
