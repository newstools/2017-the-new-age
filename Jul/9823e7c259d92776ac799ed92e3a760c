The African National Congress Women&#8217;s League (ANCWL) said it welcomed &#8220;the progressive and swift decision&#8221; by Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi in dealing with the &#8220;racial rancour at St John&#8217;s college and Klipspruit Secondary School&#8221;.The league said good riddance to St John&#8217;s College teacher after the MEC told the school to dismiss the teacher who had been found guilty of racist utterances.In addition, it supported the MEC in his decision to dissolve the school governing body at Klipspruit West Secondary School after it had demanded a coloured principal instead of a black one.&#8220;The Republic of South Africa is founded on the values of human dignity, the achievement of equality and the advancement of human rights and freedom. Section 28 (1) (d) of the Constitution requires that &#8221; Every child has the right to be protected from maltreatment, neglect, abuse or degradation&#8221;. The ANC led government working with the society must ensure that no fanatic of discrimination, oppression and abuse should be allowed to be within the school yards at any given time, &#8221; it said in a statement.ANN7 reporter
