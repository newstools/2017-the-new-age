President Jacob Zuma has written to the leaders of political parties to provide their inputs on the three new members of the Judicial Service Commission he is considering appointing. The Presidency on Friday announced that Zuma is looking at appointing Advocate Thandi Norman SC, Mr Sifiso Msomi and Advocate Thabani Masuku to fill three vacancies at the JSC. At the beginning of the month the President replaced Advocate Dumisa Ntsebeza SC, Advocate Ismael Semenya SC and Ms Andiswa Ndoni while thanking them for their service. ” The new members will fill the three vacancies occasioned by the President’s decision to replace members that he had previously designated to the JSC. ” said Presidency spokesperson Dr Bongani Ngqulunga in a statement. Earlier in the month the president wrote to political party heads regarding his intention to appoint Justice Raymond Zondo as the Deputy Chief Justice to replace Justice Dikgang Moseneke who retired last year. The President’s choice of candidates drew crticism from leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters Julius Malema for not nominating acting Deputy Chief Justice Bess Nkabinde. “… in the interest of advancing the gender struggle, why ignore a woman, well qualified, with integrity and who is already acting in the position unless Zuma does not genuinely believe in the advancement of women in society,” said EFF spokesperson Mbuyeseni Ndlozi. The Presidency responded that the President does not have powers to extend the term of a Constitutional Court judge once they have served a full term. ” The Acting Deputy Chief Justice will be discharged from active service on 31 December 2017 after serving a non-renewable term of 12 years at the Constitutional Court,” said the Presidency in a statement. -TNA Reporter
