KWADUKUZA United might be a new name in the Nedbank Cup but midfielder Thapelo Aphane and coach Thami Ngubane, to name just two in the outfit, are familiar with the tournament.The ABC Motsepe League outfit, from the small town of KwaDukuza, north of Durban, are to host PSL side Ajax Cape Town in the last 32 of the competition at the Sugar Ray Stadium on Saturday.KwaDukuza United were formed at the beginning of the season after club owner Sanele Zondi bought the status of Natal United. The Nedbank Cup is famous for nasty surprises, where teams from the lower leagues rise to fame by staging upsets against their more illustrious opponents. But often the minnows get a serious drubbing from the big guns, as was the case a few years ago when Mamelodi Sundowns annihilated Powerlines FC of the Northern Cape 24-0.Natal United was one of the lower division s outfits that caused a major upset two years ago by defeating Chippa United, who were coached by Ernst Midden dorp at the time.Aphane, who joined Natal United in 2012, was one of the players that was on the field that day when Chippa went down. The defensive midfielder said his side is ready to cause another upset against the Urban Warriors. Some of our players have been in the tournament before so that is an advantage we are going to use, Aphane said. In 2015, we made it to the next round of the tournament but lost to Golden Arrows in the last 16. We still have most of the players that were there at Natal United and others from the National First Division so we have a really good team that can compete with the best. The 27 year old believes having Ngubane s experience of coaching in the NFD will also be a boost going into the tournament.sithembisod@thenewage.co.za-Sithembiso Dindi
