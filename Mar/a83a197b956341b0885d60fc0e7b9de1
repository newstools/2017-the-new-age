Controversy engulfed Real Madrid star James Rodriguez in his native Colombia on Monday after he was photographed making an obscene gesture to journalists covering a Colombian national team training session.Rodriguez gave the middle finger to journalists gathered outside the team&#8217;s practice on Friday in Bogota ahead of their World Cup qualifier on Tuesday against Ecuador.The gesture , which is called &#8220;the pistol&#8221; in Colombia , drew criticism from some in a country where the baby-faced captain is an idol.&#8221;James lost his head, and his composure,&#8221; sports editor Gabriel Meluk of Colombian daily El Tiempo wrote in a column.A debate soon erupted on social media, with Colombians alternately criticizing and defending the 25-year-old star.The picture even spawned its own hashtag on Twitter: #NoJodanAJames (&#8220;don&#8217;t fuck with James&#8221;), which was the social network&#8217;s top trending topic in Colombia.Supporters said Rodriguez was likely under a lot of pressure ahead of the match, with Colombia occupying the last automatic qualifying place for next year&#8217;s World Cup in Russia, but only a point ahead of Ecuador and Chile.&#8221;James Rodriguez is a humanly imperfect being. He puts up with a lot from the sports media&#8217;s yellow (tabloid) journalism and destructive stories,&#8221; wrote Twitter user Miryam Riveros.The AFP photographer who captured Rodriguez&#8217;s gesture, Luis Acosta, said the footballer made it towards a group of journalists from a gym on the second story of the Colombian Football Federation&#8217;s headquarters.Neither Rodriguez nor the FCF responded when asked for a comment.-AFP
