ANCYL KwaZulu-Natal Chairperson Kwazi Mshengu says the ANC can no longer afford to be ambiguous on critical policy matters that should advance the interest of the youth.Mshengu was speaking on the sidelines of day five of the ANC policy conference.He said that as the League they had been vocal throughout the conference putting forward proposals they believe will advance the youth.&#8220;We should also not only focus on trying to create opportunities within the state for youth people because we already have a high contingent of young people. That&#8217;s why we want to venture into the business space. Young people cannot only be sellers of labour they must venture into becoming business owners,&#8221; said Mshengu.During his opening address on Friday, President Jacob Zuma highlighted that the national population was predominantly young and that youth unemployment threatened to dwindle the gains made during democracy.&#8220;The ANC needs to adapt and become responsive to the needs of our youth today. It must talk to their interests, from access to education, jobs, the need to reduce data costs, entrepreneurship to general social issues of concern to them,&#8221; said Zuma.Meanwhile according to Mshengu the revelation by ANC Treasurer-General, Zweli Mkhize that up to R700 billion remains un-invested in the economy by the financial services sector gave credence to the youth league proposal of establishing a state bank.&#8220;The four commercial banks that dominate the space are consumption driven. That&#8217;s why its easy to get a loan for a car but when you present a business idea you are presented with all sorts of challenges,&#8221; said Mshengu.During the progressive business forum earlier today, Mkhize lamented corporate South Africa&#8217;s lack of investment in the economy.Mkhize called on the private sector to ensure that there was increased investment.&#8220;What will it take for the private sector to invest that money in our economy. The call that comes from government is that we want to work with business,&#8221; he said.-Siphiwe Mchunu
