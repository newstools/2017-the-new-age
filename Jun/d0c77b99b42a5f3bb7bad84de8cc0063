Some dams across the country continue to decline week on week and the Department of Water and Sanitation has renewed calls to the public to use water wisely.The department said Gauteng dam levels forming part of the Integrated Vaal River System continued to drop week on week, resulting from a combined effect of erratic weather conditions and declining chances of rainfalls due to the winter season.The system consists of 14 dams serving mainly Gauteng, Sasol and Eskom. This week the Vaal Dam has gone down by 0.8% to 98.1% from 98.9% last week. Compared to this time last year this dam was at its lowest at 39.8%, said department spokesperson Sputnik Ratau.He said remaining below 50% this week was the Katse Dam level at 41.9%, down by 1.3% from 43.2% last week. Last year at the same time it hovered at 59.3%.The Katse Dam, a concrete arch dam on the Maliban sa in Lesotho, is the largest double-curvature arch dam. Ratau said the Sterkfontein Dam had shaken off the downward trend this week, steadying at last week s 91.4% this week.The dam is used as storage that helps to replenish the Vaal Dam. Last year this time Sterkfontein was nearly 100% full at 99.7%. Taking a nose dive this week is the Groodraai Dam at 89%, down by 0.8% from 89.8% last week. This dam recorded 83.5% during the same period last year, he said.Ratau said decreasing from 101.6% this week, the Bloemhof Dam level dropped by 1.1% to 100.5% this week. This time last year this dam was sitting at a meagre 22%. With slim prospects of any significant rainfalls forecast in the winter months, water conserving by consumers remains one of the ways of ensuring that there is an uninterrupted water supply for household and industrial use. Using water wisely would stave off the real possibility of dams plunging to critically low levels, Ratau said.-TNA REPORTER
