A Controversial refereeing decision by Victor Gomes could mean the difference between survival and relegation for PSL strugglers Baroka FC. The Limpopo outfit may look back at the penalty denied to them yesterday during the 3-2 loss to Golden Arrows as the moment that defined their season.Baroka are bottom of the log, equal on 24 points with Chippa United, whose downward slide continued with a 1-0 loss to Highlands Park on Friday. Known for his mind-baffling calls, Gomes, however, correctly adjudged the players to have encroached into the penalty area when Baroka striker Richard Matloga took his penalty kick. TV replays, though, showed that players from both sides charged into the area, just as Matloga tucked away his spotkick.Gomes called for an indirect freekick instead of ordering a retake, as per Law 14 of the rules of the game. The call had followed an equally bizarre penalty decision when the referee pointed to the spot for what looked to be a soft penalty when Arrows goalkeeper Nkosindiphile Gumede made slight contact with Victor Letsoalo. Baroka have battled to lift themselves off the bottom of the log the entire season, but have looked determined to preserve their lucrative PSL status in recent matches.Coach Kgoloko Thobejane can only hope the loss has not taken the wind out of their sails going into the remaining two matches. But it could come down to the goal difference between them and Chippa United, should both sides fail to pick up any points in their last two fixtures. A consolation would be a spot in the PSL play-offs, which allows the second from bottom side to battle it out with two teams from the National First Division for the last spot in the Absa Premiership.The relegation dogfight also includes Highlands Park, Free State Stars and Bloemfontein Celtic, who all sit ominously above Chippa and Baroka. Interestingly, Baroka take on Highlands Park in a potentially explosive relegation duel at Peter Mokaba Stadium, while Celtic host Free State Stars in a local derby at Dr Molemela Stadium on Wednesday. Chippa will be hoping to have Malesela back in charge when they welcome SuperSport United in Port Elizabeth.Malesela could not confirm whether or not he was on his way back to the Chilli Boys after he was put aside by senior management following a run of poor results.-KGOMOTSO SETHUSHA|kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
