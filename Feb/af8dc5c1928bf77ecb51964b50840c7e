And the university was able to accommodate two students with permanent accommodate. All legitimate need for accommodation is being dealt with by the university and we are engaging with the students and taking it on a case by case situation. Unfortunately we have limited resources and we can only accommodate 15% of the student body and where we have found a need we will made prevision for the students, said Jooste.However student activist Vusi Oldman Mahlangu on Wednesday said black students from the university have been complaining about racism in the university. This is a deliberate act by a racist management to advance a racist agenda. There is nothing much that has been done by the University of Pretoria, said Mahlangu.Students who are registered but have not been able to find accommodation are advised to approach the Temporary Student Committee at their help desk currently situated at the UP Sports Campus and are available until 17 February 2017.-Simangele Legodi
