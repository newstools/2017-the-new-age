Paris St Germain striker Edinson Cavani could return to his former club Napoli after his contract with the Ligue 1 club ends in 2020, he said on Monday.The Uruguay international, capped 91 times by his country, renewed his contract with PSG in April. He has scored a record 128 goals in 195 competitive games for the Paris-based club.&#8220;After PSG I don&#8217;t know what will happen but if I will want to change team I may choose to return to Napoli and then go back home,&#8221; the 30-year-old told Sky Sport Italia on Monday (sport.sky.it).&#8220;If one day I return to Napoli I would like to return in good shape. Therefore I say we&#8217;ll see at the end of my current contract which expires in 2020.&#8221;Cavani joined PSG in 2013 after spending three years at Serie A club Napoli. He made 104 appearances for the Naples-based team in all competitions, scoring 104 goals.&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go back home when I will be too old, I would like to leave football at a high level, I wish. I would like to retire when I decide so rather than football leaving me,&#8221; Cavani said.-Reuters
