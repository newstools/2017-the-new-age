About 1.7 million children under the age of five die every year due to environmental causes.Lack of sanitation, inadequate hygiene, air pollution and unsafe water are listed among the causes of deaths in children younger than five.This is according to two new reports released by the World Health Organisation yesterday.The reports show that more than one in four children under the age of five die due to an unhealthy environment.The Inheriting a Sustainable World: Atlas on Children s Health and the Environment report revealed the most common causes of deaths among children aged one month to five years old such as diarrhoea, malaria and pneumonia can be prevented through known interventions such as access to water. A polluted environment is a deadly one, particularly for young children. Their developing organs and immune systems and smaller bodies and airways, make them especially vulnerable to dirty air and water, WHO directorgeneral Dr Margaret Chan said.The report stated harmful exposure can start in the mother s womb and increase the risk of premature birth while preschool children exposed to air pollution and second-hand smoke have an increased risk of pneumonia in childhood and lifelong increased risk of chronic respiratory diseases.The second report, Don t Pollute My Future! The impact of the environment on children s health, lists respiratory infections, diarrhoea, malaria and injuries among the top environmental causes of deaths among children under five years of age.The report revealed a total of 570000 children under five die from respiratory infections linked to air pollution and second-hand smoke while 361000 die due to diarrhoea due to poor access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene. A polluted environment results in a heavy toll on the health of our children, WHO director of the department of public health, environmental and social determinants of health Dr Maria Neira said. Investing in the removal of environmental risks to health, such as improving water quality or using cleaner fuels, will result in massive health benefits. The WHO said reducing air pollution, improving access to safe water and sanitation and improving hygiene are just some of the measures that can be used to prevent child deaths and diseases.The organisation said 98% of cities in low and middle income countries do not meet the health body s air quality guidelines while the figure is 56% in high income countries. 701478
