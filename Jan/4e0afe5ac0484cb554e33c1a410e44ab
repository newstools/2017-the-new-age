The Gauteng MEC for infrastructure development, Jacob Mamabolo, has told the first UN Data Forum, under way in Cape Town, that technology and data have helped government improve the efficiency of delivering massive infrastructure projects such as the building of schools and hospitals.Speaking during the opening plenary Mamabolo said: We have made remarkable progress in leveraging, harnessing and applying smart technologies and systems, with business intelligence capabilities to deliver and drive infrastructure development. He said South Africa s development blueprint, the National Development Plan, had identified infrastructure as the key driver of economic growth, job creation and the primary tool to change the spatial landscape inherited from apartheid.This was characterised by racially skewed development patterns and the neglect of black residential areas.As the leading economic hub of the country, Gauteng is under immense pressure to deliver high quality infrastructure for its residents.The department had been invited to attend the global forum following the launch of its state-of-the-art electronic monitoring hub for government infrastructure delivery named Lutsinga Infrastructure House.It was invited to showcase the work and operations of this project nerve centre established in May.Described as part of the data revolution by statistician general Dr Pali Lehohla, Lutsinga Infrastructure House uses technology to track spending and project milestones to ensure that public infrastructure is delivered on time, at the correct quality and within budget. It is a room integrating five core data management systems generating critical business intelligence that allows for a data-centric, insightdriven proactive approach to project management. Centralised dashboards display critical data aggregated from all our operations and has automated our infrastructure delivery core process in the Province, Mamabolo said.Lutsinga Infrastructure House brought about a radical turnaround in the institutional and organisational culture relating to project management at the department. We needed to ensure that our managers change their reporting habits and that they are accountable. We needed to bring transparency and visibility to the management environment and build our capacity to fight and root out corruption, he said.NTOMBI NKOSIntombin@thenewage.co.za
