Comedian Tumi Morake was involved in a serious car accident Friday night whilst on holiday. It is reported that Morake was travelling with her family towards Sun City in a sponsored silver Jaguar when a collision between two light motor vehicles on the R556 outside of Rustenburg in the North-West Province. A day ago Morake shared pictures on social media of their family vacation which included a nice tour of the Basotho cultural village. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said that on arrival at the scene paramedics found two light motor vehicles on the side of the road. “Paramedics assessed the patients and found that ten people, including three children, had sustained minor to moderate injuries. Fortunately, in this incident, no serious injuries or fatalities were found,” said Meiring. All the patients were transported to Medicare Rustenburg for further treatment. -TNA Reporter
