The Film and Publication Board (FPB) has urged parents to monitor their children&#8217;s devices and report to it if they come across the sinister Blue Whale app.The Blue Whale app, that s set to arrive in South Africa, is a game that urges participants to carry out a series of daunting tasks over 50 days.Participants are told to harm themselves by carving out whales on their bodies with razor blades and ultimately they are told to take their own lives, usually by jumping off a tall building.According to the FPB the app also goes by different names &#8220;A Silent House&#8221;; A Sea of Whale&#8221; and &#8220;Wake me up at 4:20am&#8221;.&#8220;Although the game App is currently not available on the South African market, there is a possibility that it can be shared peer to peer,&#8221; the FPB in a statement.&#8221; Parents and guardians are therefore urged to monitor their children&#8217;s devices and report to the FPB if they come across such content.&#8221;Social media analyst Yavi Madurai, who has researched the game has warned its arrival in SA was imminent.Cathy Chambers of the South African Depression and Anxiety Group (Sadag) said that regulation could safeguard kids from such apps. It would have been easier to deal with these issues if the internet was better regulated so sites like these can be banned or closed down, she said.She said Sadag did not want to promote the game by speaking about it but wanted to create awareness, especially among parents, of its dangers. The game is obviously preying on vulnerable teenagers. It is an incredibly dangerous game, parents should monitor their children for any unusual signs or symptoms. There are also security settings that can be installed in cellphones to protect children, she saidMore than 16 teenage girls have died in Russia due to the game. Russian authorities say that the founder of the Blue Whale app 21 year-old Philipp Budeikin told police that the purpose of the app was to rid society of biological waste .He claimed that the victims were happy to die and he was cleaning society -TNA Reporter
