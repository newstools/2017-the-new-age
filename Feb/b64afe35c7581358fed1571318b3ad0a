&nbsp;With coffee being proven to help your performance in bed, here are some other ways you can spice things up between the sheets. But what other scientifically-proven ways can improve men and women&#8217;s love lives? Here are a few tips that we share with you to have fun in bed.Watch rom-coms If your sex life is flagging, it might be time to give Breaking Bad a break and slip to a different DVD&#8230;. like Love Actually. Because a study of newlyweds by psychologists in New York found that couples who watched and then discussed five films about relationships over the course of a month, could cut their chances of divorce.Strip off, snuggle up Couples who sleep in the nuddy are more likely to get naughty. A study of more than 1,000 Brits discovered 57 % of couples who go to bed naked, claimed to be happy compared to 48% of pyjama wearers. Couples who sleep less than an inch apart, are more intimate than couples who sleep on opposite sides of the bed. Experts at a UK-based university found 94% of couples who spent the night in contact with each other were happy with their relationships, while only 68% of those who kept their hands to themselves said they didn&#8217;t feel the romance.Perfect your downward-facing pose It&#8217;s a yoga move and experts in India reckon, men who do it on a daily basis can last three times longer in bed. Urologists say the isometric exercise helps them delay orgasm and thus get more time to enjoy themselves.Whisper, tweet nothing Twitter is the &#8220;third person&#8221; in many relationships, according to a study by a university in the US. It found that &#8216;active use of social media leads to greater amounts of Twitter-related conflict between romantic partners, which in turns leads to infidelity, breakup and divorce&#8217;. Another study claims texting damages relationship skills. It found that men and women who used texts to apologise or settle arguments had poorer relationships and a worse sex life.Warm up an apple tart Experts at the Smell and Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago say the smell of food can increase a woman&#8217;s sexual desire and the whiff of apples boosts arousal by up to 24%. It&#8217;s time to get baking, guys!Don&#8217;t think of rushing up the aisle Couples who live together before getting married are more likely to stay together for eight years or more, according to researchers in the US. They found an 18-year-old woman in a relationship has a 16% chance of marrying by the age of 22 and staying married for at least 12 years. However, if she lived with her partner first, that rose to a 22% chance.Stub it out Men who smoke have twice the risk of developing erectile dysfunction. Smoking damages arteries, affecting circulation, affects the ability to get and maintain an erection and impedes the ability to orgasm. But a study by US researchers in 2011 claimed people who&#8217;d successfully kicked cigarettes had thicker, more rigid erections and reached maximal arousal five times faster than smokers who relapsed.Wear red to get into the mood It&#8217;s a well known fact that guys love a lady in red, but researchers a US-based University found men and women are more attracted to partners wearing crimson. Professor of psychology Andrew Elliott said, &#8220;We found women view men in red as higher in status, more likely to make money and more likely to climb the social ladder. And it&#8217;s this high-status judgment that leads to the attraction. Men were more likely to say they wanted to have sex with a woman and that they would be willing to spend more on a date if she were in red.&#8221;Have a purple patch Forget Fifty Shades of Grey. Couples with purple-themed bedrooms apparently have more sex. A survey of 2,000 adults conducted online found that lovers who like to lie on lilac have three times as many &#8216;intimate encounters a week&#8217; than those who have grey bedding. And if your sheets are in purple silk, you&#8217;re well away because couples who like the slinky feel tend to feel sexy more than four times a week. Nibble on a celery stick to get fruity Celery is said to stimulate the pituitary gland, which is key in releasing sexual hormones. Some experts say it also mimics the smell of androstenone the man male pheromone so it&#8217;s more of an aphrodisiac for men. Ladies could nibble on strawberries, peaches and mangoes which are rich in boron &#8211; which turns calcium into a powerful aphrodisiac. Morning glory Morning sex is good for your mood and long-term health and men are likely to last longer and finish stronger as testosterone levels peak in the morning. Researchers say that morning sex also increases levels of IgA, an antibody that helps to fight against infection like taking your daily vitamins&#8230; only much more pleasurable.Don&#8217;t plan children right away! If you&#8217;re already heard the patter of tiny feet, best skip to No: 10! Because a study conducted on 5,000 couples found that the childless ones were the happiest. The &#8216;Enduring Love?&#8217; project suggested that not having kids meant couples were more satisfied with their relationships, were more likely to feel valued by their partner and were more likely to have a more active sex life.Snog and smooch A study of more than 1,000 couples who&#8217;ve been together for 25 years found that frequent kissing and cuddling made for satisfying sex lives. But researchers have found smooching is more important to men than to women. Chomp on some dark chocolate Eating chocolate particularly dark produces a rush of endorphins (the brain&#8217;s feel-good chemicals). Chocolate also contains phenylethylamine which stimulates the release of dopamine into the parts of the brain associated with orgasms, methylxanthines which increase your skin&#8217;s sensitivity and flavinols that can create a Viagra-like effect. But according to a recent study by Cancer Research UK, one in five women would give up sex before they gave up chocolate!Double date Some couples love them while others hate the idea of sharing their date night with friends. But US researchers claim that going out as a foursome may improve your own relationship. A study a US-based university found, seeing your romantic partner reveal information about his or herself and seeing other people respond to your partner in a validating way may not only give you a new perspective but also make you feel good about them. Just remember to go home with the right partner.This article first appeared on The Times of India
