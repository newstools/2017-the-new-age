ANC Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe has said there was nothing wrong with branches in Mpumalanga voting for unity. He was speaking after ANC presidential candidate Mathews Phosa announced that he would be taking the ruling party to court to apply for the dissolution of the Provincial Executive Committee (PEC). Two hundred and twenty three branches opted to vote for unity over and above the names that were available while 123 nominated Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma and 117 nominated Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa. The trend continued with the nomination of all positions in the top six. “I don’t know why Phosa is unhappy with the unity votes. Does he think they are his?” Mantashe said. Mantashe said the ANC did not have a problem with the unity votes but said there would not be a unity option on the ballot during the elective conference in December. Branches voted at the ANC’s Provincial General Council meeting in Mpumalanga at the weekend.   -TNA Reporter
