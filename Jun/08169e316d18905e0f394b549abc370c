A clearly angry Helen Zille said the Democratic Alliance&#8217;s decision to suspend her did not comply with the party&#8217;s constitution. She also denied she had not refused to apologise.This emerged as party leader Mmusi Maimane announced her suspension.The party responded with a hurriedly written statement saying it had given Zille 72 hours to respond to it&#8217;s decision to suspend her until the disciplinary action is completed.&#8220;We have given Helen Zille the opportunity to indicate to us why she should not be so suspended,&#8221; the statement read.&#8220;The notice calling for representations on suspension has already been served and requires any representations to be made within 72 hours .&#8221;The final decision of the DA Federal Executive regarding whether to suspend Zille will be made once any such representations have been made and considered, the statement said.But Zille said the DA leader&#8217;s statement, &#8220;his reason for why the FEDEX took this decision is not the full story. This will emerge over time. It is not correct that I have refused to apologise. I have apologised publicly. What I have not agreed to do is plead guilty to charges of misconduct which I never committed,&#8221; she said on Twitter.&#8220;Because the DA stands for freedom and fairness, we need to follow due process of law, expecially when this is iniated by the leader himself. &#8211; TNA reporter
