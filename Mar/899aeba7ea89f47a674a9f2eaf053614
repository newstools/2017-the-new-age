CRUNCH TIME: The last few days of March pose a great challenge to Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini and Sassa over paying grants to 17 million beneficiaries.THE Ides of March of a kind may be facing Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini as she is expected to present before March 31 an affidavit on why she should not be personally held liable for placing the programme of social assistance to millions of vulnerable people in jeopardy through her actions or inactions.On Friday in the Constitutional Court, justice Johan Froneman, reading the majority judgment, was scathing. Froneman said Dlamini should in the same affidavit show why she should not, out of her own pocket, foot the bill of the parties who brought the matter to court and this includes those of the friends of the court. The costs are expected to run into millions of rands.Froneman, in a succinct manner, exposed the inefficiencies of the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) operations, a department entrusted with the distribution of grants to 17 million beneficiaries who solely depend on it to make ends meet, for its sloppiness and inefficiency in executing its constitutional mandate of serving the most vulnerable people in society.With the judgment handed down by the highest court in the land, the judge reminded South Africans that he was safeguarding a constitutional right to avert a catastrophe another damning indictment against Dlamini who was expected to exercise oversight over the grants.Froneman said Dlamini had the primary responsibility of ensuring that there was nothing less than efficient execution of this important mandate through the CEO she appoints. And so, implied in his words, is that had the CEO, an accounting officer, acted judiciously and consistently with the constitutional obligations, there would really have been no need for the debacle and ineptness to have occurred.The judge said the constitutional duties to the 17 million beneficiaries was not something to be taken lightly and simply ignored.He said the action by the government to have gone the route that Dlamini s department had traversed was the deepest and most shaming of ironies that a private company, Cash Paymaster Services (CPS), had in the first place been entrusted with the responsibility of providing such services to the government.What the judge did not say was that CPS is an American-based company and in keeping with the government s black empowerment policy, preferential treatment needed to be provided to the previously disadvantaged communities as a way of giving them a leg-up to make up for the lean years in which they were excluded from the mainstream economy by the previous apartheid administrations.As if this were not enough, even Dlamini s closest allies the ANC and the government have distanced themselves from Sassa s shambles by unequivocally declaring that the court s judgment was spot on, implicitly agreeing with the words of the judge that Dlamini, by her action or inaction, had placed the programme of social assistance in jeopardy.The country has no way of knowing how President Jacob Zuma might act or not act against the minister.What the country knows today is that she, according to the court judgment, bears the responsibility to ensure that Sassa fulfils its functions, an in addition, to explain to the court what went wrong , in the words of Froneman.That is not an easy ask. Dlamini in the next few days leading before March 31 for Julius Caesar the Ides of March happened on March 15 when he met his ultimate fate will have to spend sleepless nights figuring out how she might get out of the deep hole she dug for herself.As for Cosatu, it said the future of the ANC was dependent on how it responded when the organisation was presented with scandals such as social grants , with the spokesperson for the federation saying Dlamini was no longer an asset to the liberation movement. This tells us the minister has no solution to the problem. This was a deliberate attempt to ignore the decision by the court, he said.And so the last few days will pose a great challenge to both Sassa and Dlamini as they worry about their own version of the Ides of March.Jo-Mangaliso Mdhlela Jo-Mangaliso Mdhlela is head of the TNA/ANN7 cadet course.
