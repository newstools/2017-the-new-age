THE EU and UN yesterday rallied donor countries and aid groups to support a devastated Syria at a conference overshadowed by a suspected chemical attack blamed by the West on Damascus. The Brussels meeting, co-chaired by the EU and UN, is a follow up to last year s London conference, which raised $11bn (R151bn) for humanitarian aid programmes.UN chief Antonio Guterres said: The horrific events of yesterday demonstrate unfortunately that war crimes are going on in Syria. This conference must represent a moment of truth where the international community finally comes together to settle the war and give the Syrian people hope. The conference is also meant to support UN-sponsored peace talks in Geneva on solving the conflict which has claimed more than 320 000 lives and displaced most of the Syrian population. Delegates stressed the importance of both tracks after at least 72 civilians including 20 children died in a suspected chemical weapons attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhun in Idlib province.The Brussels conference will not deal with the key sticking point in the Geneva talks the rebels and their international backers demanding President Bashar al-Assad must step down while Moscow and Tehran show no sign of abandoning their ally.Assad s main backer Russia, which is also represented at the Brussels conference, said Tuesday s attack happened after a Syrian air strike hit a terrorist warehouse containing toxic substances . EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said it was surreal especially today to be discussing the postconflict situation . But if you want peace you have to start building peace and the conditions for peace , she said, urging a strong push to the political talks in Geneva. Some victims of THE suspected chemical attack in Syria have symptoms consistent with exposure to a category of chemicals that includes nerve agents, the World Health Organisation said yesterday.The UN health agency said the deadly attack in Idlib province on Tuesday appeared to have involved chemical weapons, pointing to the apparent lack of external injuries reported in cases showing a rapid onset of similar symptoms, including acute respiratory distress as the main cause of death . Some cases appear to show additional signs consistent with exposure to organophosphorus chemicals, a category of chemicals that includes nerve agents, it said.At least 72 civilians, among them 20 children, were killed in Tuesday s attack ON rebel-held Khan Sheikhun, and dozens more were left gasping for air, convulsing and foaming at the mouth, doctors said.Washington and London have pointed the finger at Syria s government for the attack, though the regime has denied using chemical weapons.French President Fran ois Hollande yesterday called for an international response to the suspected chemical attack that killed scores of civilians in Syria, calling it a war crime .Hollande reiterated his indignation over the use of chemical weapons in Syria and called for a reaction by the international community commensurate with this war crime , the president s office said in a statement. The UN Security Council was to hold an emergency meeting on the attack, later yesterday with Britain, France and the US pushing a resolution demanding a swift investigation.Pope Francis yesterday condemned a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria that left more than 70 dead in a rebel-held town as an unacceptable massacre.We watch horrified as the latest events in Syria unfold, the pope said at his midweek public audience in St Peter s square. I completely deplore the unacceptable massacre that took place in Idlib province yesterday, where dozens of defenceless people, including many children, were killed. The 80-year-old pontiff spoke out as Russia and Western powers disputed what happened at Khan Sheikhun. AFPBRYAN MCMANUS BRUSSELS
