The petrol price is set to increase by 29c per litre while diesel will go up by 21c, at midnight.Other fuels going up include a 17c increase of illuminating paraffin in terms of its whole sale pricing, and the SMNRP (Single Maximum National Retail Price) of paraffin shoots up by 22c with gas moving north by 21c.The department has placed three reasons for the increase citing the stronger rand, which has enabled to reduce the hike by 12c. The increase in the price for crude oil also played a part.&#8220;Oil prices rose on news that key crude exporters, including Saudi Arabia and Russia were cutting production to reduce excess supply of crude.Furthermore, the US inventory data showed that the global market was tightening due to lower production by OPEC and other exporters.&#8220;The prices of petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin increased on average in the international markets during the period under review. The Basic Fuel Price (BFP) of all the products increased in line with the price of crude oil,&#8221; the Department said.
