Standard Bank finds itself in a revealing position after trying to sneak in additional relief demands in Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan s court application, which declare that President Jacob Zuma and his Cabinet cannot intervene in Oakbay s dispute with the banks.In filing its affidavit supporting Gordhan s case, Standard Bank, entered a notice of motion asking the court that: It is declared that no member of national executive of government including the president and all his members of the cabinet, acting on their own accord or for and on behalf of Cabinet, is empowered to intervene, in any manner whatsoever, in any decision taken by the seventeenth responded (Standard Bank) to terminate its banking relationship with Oakbay investments and its associated entities. In his explanatory supporting affidavit to the Oakbay main answering affidavit, Pieter Van Der Merwe CEO of VR Laser Services said this demand was fatally irregular and defective, incompetent and a nullity.He said the bank s purported application was still born to the extent that Standard Bank wished to institute motion proceedings for substantive relief, which is directed at persons who are not parties to either of the application. Such proceedings, in accordance with the rules, would have formally given notice to all affected parties of the relief sought and afforded them the ordinary time to file an intention to oppose and answering affidavits. This did not occur, his affidavit read.Standard Bank, which filed papers last December, claiming reasons for closing Oakbay accounts were suspicious transactions, was supposed to serve the president with its papers so that he or any member of his executive would choose to participate in the Gordhan application.Van der Merwe in his affidavit hits out at Standard Banking, saying: One express objective is to forestall the appointment of a judicial commission of inquiry by the president into the termination of the relevant banking relationships. He further said: The facts relied upon by the Standard Bank do not support the inference that the President is considering the appointment of a judicial commission with such limited term references. Efforts to get comments from Dr Bongani Ngqulunga spokesperson of the presidency were unsuccessful.Standard Bank also admitted auditing firm KPMG and other banks decision to part ways with Oakbay played a role in their decision to close the accounts.SAMUEL MUNGADZEsamuelm@thenewage.co.za
