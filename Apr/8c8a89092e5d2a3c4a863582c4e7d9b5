The head of France&#8217;s prison service has quit, the justice ministry announced Sunday, two days ahead of a report on the country&#8217;s problem-plagued penitentiaries.Philippe Galli, 60, who was named to head the prison service only last year, &#8220;presented his resignation on Friday&#8221;, the ministry said in a statement.It gave no reason for Galli&#8217;s departure but sources within the prison service said Galli and Justice Minister Jean-Jacques Urvoas were badly at odds.Galli could not be reached for comment. He will be replaced for the time being by his deputy, Stephane Bredin.Urvoas on Tuesday is to receive a white paper on prisons drawn up by a commission headed by a conservative former senator, Jean-Rene Lecerf.France&#8217;s prison system has become a hot political issue ahead of the April 23 presidential elections.The country&#8217;s jails have been criticised for chronic overcrowding. Social workers say a lack of support for young delinquents makes imprisonment a breeding ground for jihadism.The number of prisoners reached a record 69,430 on March 1.Last week the head of a major prison at Villepinte, north of Paris, warned that her facility was already housing twice its capacity and was unable to accept more.-AFP
