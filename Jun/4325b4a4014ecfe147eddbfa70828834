Singer Kelly Khumalo s suitability as a relationship fixer remains in question as she readies to take over the reins of dating show Love and Matrimony s debut on Saturday.Khumalo will be profiling South African entertainment queens and kings about their love lives, marriage, break-ups and of course challenges they face or have faced in the name of love.First to be interviewed is fellow singer and sister of Kelly Khumalo, Zandi Khumalo.She will be sharing her experiences as a newly married woman among other things.While many wait in anticipation for the show at 7.30pm on GauTV (DStv 265), it remains to be seen if Khumalo will be able to dish out constructive relationship advice, given the history of her many past failed love affairs, which continues to make a good fodder for social media. It saddens me to say Kelly Khumalo s love life relationships are just messed up, Twitter user @ZiphoraRadebe once wrote.The songbird s love life has been thrust into the spotlight in the past with her celebrity relationships that have been marred by fights, romance, break-ups and infidelity.The musician has dated rapper Molemo Jub Jub Maarohanye and slain Bafana Bafana goalkeeper Senzo Meyiwa, who was shot dead at Kelly s mother s house in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni in 2014.During a recent Metro FM interview on the Fresh Breakfast show, the Asine singer said: I don t think I ve ever been in love or been loved the way I wished to be. It s always been about who s around me and who s giving me attention. SIYABONGA SITHOLEsiyabongas@thenewage.co.za
