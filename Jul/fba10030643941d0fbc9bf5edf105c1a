As the second inquest into the death of anti-apartheid activist and teacher Ahmed Timol continues, the Ditsong Museum in Pretoria is set to open an exhibition about his life this week.The exhibition will feature photographs of Timol s political life up until his death in police custody in 1971 at John Vorster Square, now called Johannesburg Central police station.According to the apartheid security police, Timol jumped out of the building s 10th floor window.An inquest was held in 1972 and the magistrate ruled Timol s death a suicide and that no one should be held responsible for it.This exhibition comes after the conclusion of an emotional first week of the hearings into Timol s death in the South Gauteng High Court.At the next round of hearings to be held later this month, three of the police officers who were involved in Timol s arrest are expected to take the witness stand.Sgt Joao Rodriques and two other officers, N Els and JP Fourie, are set to testify following an order by judge Billy Mothle to have them subpoenaed.The judge also ordered the police commissioner to help the court with locating the officers and providing legal representation for them.During the first round of hearings, Mothle heard testimonies from Timol s younger brother Mohammed, co-accused and friend Dr Salim Essop and former detainee Dr Dilshad Jhetam, among others.Essop and Timol were arrested together in October 1971 after banned SACP and ANC propaganda material was found in their car. Timol died five days after the arrest.Jhetam said when she asked a warder at John Vorster Square where Timol had been transferred she was told that the Indian is dead .She said when she was interrogated she could hear Timol s screams from another room every night and in the early hours of the morning.She said the screams grew louder and became more desperate as he begged them to stop.Detailing his experience in detention, Essop said the security police subjected him to various torture tactics, including having his head put in a plastic bag until near suffocation, being repeatedly kicked on his thighs in a method known as mule kickers and electrocution.The inquest is expected to resume from July 24 to August 4 and August 10 and 11.LILLIAN SELAPISAlillians@thenewage.co.za
