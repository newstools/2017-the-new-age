This week promises another episode of theatrics in Parliament when President Jacob Zuma, his deputy, Cyril Ramaphosa, and the Finance Minister take questions from MPs on different occasions.The topic that is likely to confront each one of them will be the question of whether the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) will be able to pay out social grants to 17 million of the poorest South Africans on April 1.No matter if each of one of them has answered this question in one way or another, opposition parties will be waiting for them, ready with questions meant to embarrass them, as well as Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini.Tomorrow, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan will honour an invitation to brief the standing committee on public accounts about Sassa, his meetings with Dlamini and Cash Paymaster Services. This appearance can be called scene setter number one.On Wednesday, in what can be termed scene setter number two, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will be in the National Council of Provinces to answer questions verbally.But the main event of the parliamentary week, will undoubtedly, play out in the National Assembly on Thursday when President Zuma will answer questions posed by MPs.Given the pattern of the President s previous appearances in the Assembly, sparks will fly.The week for committees starts today when the ad hoc committee charged to fill vacancies in the Commission for Gender Equality starts holding interviews, which is expected to continue tomorrow.Rural education will be on the table at the portfolio committee on basic education tomorrow, while the Department of Communications will be informing the portfolio committee on communications about the third quarter expenditure and performance report of the Government Communication and Information System.The financial imbroglio at PetroSA will come under the scrutiny of the portfolio committee on energy tomorrow when the Department of Energy and the board of the state-owned entity will make a presentation about a forensic report. PetroSA will also brief the committee about its turnaround strategy.On Wednesday, Police Minister Nathi Nhleko will take the police portfolio committee into his confidence about the proposed firearms amnesty, while the South African Police Service and Independent Police Investigative Directorate will update the committee on progress related to the Farlam Report.Transnet will present its answers about irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure to Scopa on the same day. Parliament will receive a high level delegation from the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria tomorrow.Discussions will take place behind closed doors. The Nigerian Parliament has proposed the visit for the two legislative institutions to discuss matters of mutual interest and to strengthen existing diplomatic relations between the two countries, particularly in the context of recent tensions between certain members of some communities and some foreign nationals.DENNIS CRUYWAGENnews@thenewage.co,za
