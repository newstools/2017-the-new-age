The Health Ombusman Malegapuru Makgoba has on Wednesday revealed that more deaths linked to the Esidimeni&#8217;s disaster is now above 100 and increasing.Makgoba says the data from Gauteng had many problems as some of the people who had died had two dates of death. We are still getting the data of deaths and they are already over 100 deaths. We discovered that all the 27 Non-Governmental Organization&#8217;s (NGO) where the patients were taken operated under invalid licences,&#8221; Mokgoba said.This is after more people came forward to claim their loved ones.Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi noted on Tuesday that there were 19 unidentified bodies in mortuaries from NGOs where Esidimeni patients were transferred.Motsoaledi announced that 22 of the 27 NGO&#8217;s will be closed based on the assessments of the expert team that he has assembled in this matter.DA shadowing MEC for Health Jack Bloom says he welcomes Motsoaledi&#8217;s announcement of closing down 22 of the 27 NGOs. I think it is good that the private health sector will also be used for the patients, including the re-opening of Life Esidimeni facilities in a phased manner. This is necessary because existing state facilities are already over-crowded, said Bloom.Makgoba reported earlier this month that At least 94 of Gauteng s most vulnerable mental illness patients died after the provincial health department stubbornly moved patients from Life Esidimeni to dodgy NGO&#8217;s.The ombudsman blamed three officials MEC Qedani Mahlangu, head of department Dr Tiego Ephraim Selebano and director Dr Makgabo Manamela, saying they would not listen to anyone and ignored the warnings.Makgoba added that the planning for the move was poor or non-existent and carried out in a way that put patient&#8217;s care in danger, with no medical assessments done before the patient were transferred.&#8220;Vulnerable patients were transferred between NGOs and relatives were not even informed of which NGOs were their loved ones being transferred too.&#8221;MEC Mahlangu resigned just before the statement was released.TNA Reporter
