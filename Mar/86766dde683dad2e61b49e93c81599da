Eskom said South Africans saved an average of 420MW during last Saturday s Earth Hour from 8.30pm to 9.30pm.This is enough to power a city the size of Polokwane or Port Elizabeth.As part of its support for the Earth Hour campaign, Eskom measured the reduction in electricity used during the hour against the typical consumption for this time on an average Saturday evening.Eskom s Khulu Phasiwe said they encourage people to take action on climate change beyond this one hour and to make environmental conservation part of their daily lifestyles.Earth Hour started in Sydney, Australia in 2007 and is organised by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) as a lights-off event to raise awareness of climate change.More than 162 countries and territories worldwide are part of this initiative, which engages a massive mainstream community on a range of environmental issues.South Africans joined millions of people, businesses and landmarks around the globe, who set that hour aside to host events, switch off their non-essential lights and make noise for climate change action.The city of Johannesburg switched off the lights of iconic buildings and landmarks such as the Nelson Mandela Bridge and Metro Centre, the city s headquarters in Braamfontein, in support of the annual global initiative.Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba says the city is committed to the Earth Hour initiative as it encourages residents to be mindful of their own carbon footprint. The city s growth and development strategy 2040 envisions a resilient, sustainable and liveable city. It also commits to climate change mitigation and identifies climate change as a cross-sectoral imperative of the city. 701570TNA REPORTERnews@thenewage.co.za
