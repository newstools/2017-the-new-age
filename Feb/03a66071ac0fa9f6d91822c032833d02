&nbsp;Two women arrested over the killing of the North Korean leader&#8217;s half-brother in Kuala Lumpur knew they were taking part in a poison attack, Malaysia&#8217;s police chief said Wednesday, after reports they believed it was a prank.&#8220;Yes, of course they knew,&#8221; Khalid Abu Bakar said when asked by a reporter if the women knew they were carrying a toxic substance when they approached Kim Jong-Nam, the sibling of Kim Jong-Un.&#8220;I think you have seen the video, right? The lady was moving away with her hands towards the bathroom. She was very aware that it was toxic and that she needed to wash her hands.&#8221;Indonesian police had said one of the suspects had been duped into believing she was taking part in a TV prank show.AFP
