We may not have mountains and seas but we do have awesome people. That makes Gauteng unique. We are selling lifestyle and culture, head of Joburg Tourism Authority Barba Gaoganediwe said.He said through the festival s diverse arts, culture and heritage programme, the festival is ideal in bringing about true social cohesion and bring jobs to artists adding that the creative and cultural sectors can contribute to the economy of the city and to community development.Basha Uhuru Freedom Festival seeks to implement arts, culture and heritage programmes aligned with the Vision 2030 aimed at urban regeneration, community development, eradicating poverty and improving township economies.siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
