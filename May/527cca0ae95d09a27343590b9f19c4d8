The stage has been set for Minister Lynne Brown to face her detractors and defend herself against allegations of misleading Parliament when she is due to attend a meeting of the Public Enterprises Portfolio Committee on Tuesday.Brown has been under fire ever since Eskom announced weeks ago that it would re-employ its former CEO Brian Molefe, who resigned and went on to become an ANC MP in Parliament.He returned to work amid a tumultuous welcome from Eskom staff a week ago. Brown was due to attend a meeting of the National Assembly s Public Enterprises Portfolio Committee last week but cried off because of a DA court application to stymie Molefe s return.It is understood that she will use tomorrow s meeting to deal with some of the contentious matters.On Friday DA member of Parliament Natasha Mazzone announced she would formally report Brown to the Ethics Committee for allegedly misleading Parliament when she failed to disclose if there had been any contracts of engagement between Eskom and Trillian.Mazzone said that the DA had already referred these allegations to the public protector to ensure that the matter was investigated.She also called on the Deputy President, Cyril Ramaphosa, as the leader of Government Business, to instruct Brown to appear at the next sitting of the National Assembly Public Enterprises Portfolio Committee. She urged Ramaphosa to ensure that Brown subjected herself to a full-scale parliamentary inquiry into the state of Eskom and the reappearance of Molefe. I will write to Ramaphosa today, urging him to ensure that Brown submits herself to a full-scale inquiry it is his responsibility as leader of Government Business to do so. The DA will make use of every possible avenue to ensure that Minister Brown is held to account for any discrepancies regarding Trillian and the return of Brian Molefe, Mazonne said.DENNIS CRUYWAGENdennisc@thenewage.co.za
