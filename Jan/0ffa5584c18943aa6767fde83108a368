Free State Stars coach Giovanni Solinas has been tipped to take over at Orlando Pirates as head coach.Since Muhsin Ertugral resigned from the club, Augusto Palacios was asked to take the reins as interim coach until the end of last year, with the club saying they would appoint a new coach this year.It is now understood that Solinas is unsettled at struggling Ea Lla Koto and is planning to leave the club with the Buccaneers his next destination.A decision could be made before the end of the week.A source said Pirates had approached Solinas and he was keen to join the club.Pirates have been struggling under Palacios and ended 2016 with back-toback defeats to Bloemfontein Celtic and Maritzburg United. Pirates have been interested in him even before they employed Ertugral, the source said. They thought Ertugral would be the right man to lead the ship but they have now renewed their interest (in Solinas) and we ll see what happens in the coming weeks. Solinas is in his second spell with Free State Stars but the results have not been positive for the club as they sit in 14th position of the Absa Premiership with 14 points from 15 matches.The Buccaneers need a coach who will lead them in the right direction and the source said they felt that the Italian would be the right man for the job.There are also rumours that Pirates players are not content with Palacios and aren t too enthusiastic to follow the Peruvian s orders.And with Pirates celebrating their 80th anniversary this year, they will be looking to win silverware to celebrate in style.Meanwhile, former Celtic and Golden Arrows coach Serame Letsoaka has already been linked with a move to replace Solinas.Letsoaka has not worked since he parted ways with Celtic last year.NEVILLE KHOZAnevillek@thenewage.co.za
