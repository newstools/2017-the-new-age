The ANC has accused the DA of lying about claims its leader, Mmusi Maimane, was due to have met the president of the Palestinian Authority Mahmoud Abbas.It has called on the DA to hold the mendacious Maimane to account.In a statement about Maimane s recent visit, the DA said his scheduled visit with Abbas was cancelled by the latter s office due to a scheduling conflict.Yesterday, ANC national spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said in a statement that the Embassy of the State of Palestine had categorically denied that Abbas was ever scheduled to meet Maimane.Referring to the embassy s statement, Kodwa said they had only learnt of Maimane s visit through the media and that no appointments were arranged in Ramallah.Kodwa said: It is clear from this that the DA blatantly lied in their widely disseminated media release of January 12. This blatant misrepresentation is clearly an attempt to whitewash their visit, their ill-conceived visit to the apartheid Israeli state. Lying about an alleged appointment with President Abbas was a cheap attempt by the DA and Mmusi Maimane in particular to gain credibility for this visit, which has now spectacularly backfired, exposing the DA for what they are unprincipled with a callous disregard for the Palestinian people. Kodwa said for an organisation claiming the values of comrade Mandela, which include an unwavering solidarity with the Palestinian people, this was hypocrisy at its worst. It our hope and expectation that the DA will act with the same vigour directed at ANC leaders to hold their own leader, the mendacious Mmusi Maimane to account, he said.On Sunday, the DA said in statement Maimane had scheduled a meeting with Abbas, but it could not take place due to a scheduling conflict in Abbas s diary.According to the DA, Maimane visited Israel and the Palestinian Territories to listen and learn about the conflict first hand and to discuss how South Africa should play a more constructive role in bringing the parties together for peace.Under its leadership, the DA said, South Africa would play a constructive role in bringing the two parties together instead of inflaming tensions between them .However, Kodwa was dismissive of the DA s position. We also warn the DA not to mislead the public by suggesting that our government and our party share the same position as the DA on Palestine. The ANC not only supports a just and fair solution but we also have for several years attended, actively supported and organised international solidarity campaigns with the people of Palestine, Kodwa said.Unlike the DA, he said, the ANC was calling out Israel for its racism against African refugees. We condemn Israel s apartheid policies and its violations of international law, including the building of illegal settlements and the inhumane Gaza siege. Dennis Cruywagendennisc@thenewage.co.za
