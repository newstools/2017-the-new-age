Zambian opposition leader Hakainde Hichilema will remain in custody until at least next week after a court said Thursday it would rule on his application to have treason charges against him dropped.Hichilema was arrested last week for allegedly blocking President Edgar Lungu&#8217;s motorcade while both were travelling to a traditional event in Zambia&#8217;s Western province. Hichilema&#8217;s lawyers asked the court to throw out the treason charges. Magistrate Greenwell Malumani said he needed time to study the submissions and would rule on the application next Wednesday.&#8220;The issues involved are many and complex and therefore I cannot hurriedly make a ruling,&#8221; Malumani said. Hichilema, a wealthy businessman, has been detained since police raided his Lusaka home on April 11.He has been accused of endangering Lungu&#8217;s life when Hichilema&#8217;s convoy allegedly refused to give way to the presidential motorcade in a high-speed dispute on a main road.In court, he was also accused of trying to overthrow the government between October and April. Hichilema has launched several legal attempts to challenge the result of last year&#8217;s election, which he lost narrowly to Lungu.The election campaign was marked by clashes between supporters of Lungu&#8217;s Patriotic Front (PF) party and Hichilema&#8217;s UPND.-AFP
