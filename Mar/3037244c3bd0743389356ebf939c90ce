Struggle stalwart Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, 80, has been discharged from hospital after being admitted on Thursday.The ANC national executive committee member was admitted to Johannesburg s Milpark hospital for what her family said was a routine medical check-up.Madikizela-Mandela s spokesperson, Victor Dlamini said: This is her hospital of long standing. When she goes in for check-ups, sometimes they just ask her to stay over for observation. The veteran activist was admitted to the hospital for several weeks in 2016 for back surgery.Another struggle veteran Ahmed Kathrada is still in a Johannesburg hospital after he was admitted last Saturday for surgery relating to blood clotting on the brain.Kathrada, 87, was initially admitted for dehydration, but doctors later picked up the clot, which has subsequently been removed.Ahmed Kathrada Foundation director Neeshan Balton said Kathrada is still expected to stay in hospital anotherweek or so as the operation requires time in and out of the hospital. He ll be kept in hospital to avoid infection. He is stable and when conscious he communicates with his doctor and close family members, Balton said.Kathrada is one of three Rivonia Trialists still alive today, the other two being Andrew Mlangeni and Denis Goldberg.Along with Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Govan Mbeki, Raymond Mhlaba and Elias Motsoaledi, they were sentenced in 1964 to life imprisonment on Robben Island during the infamous Rivonia Trial.Meanwhile, the National Heritage Council is planning to launch the Winnie Madikizela-Mandela Foundation in August as part of preserving her heritage.The council led a delegation to her home village of Mbhongweni in Bizana, also visiting the church where Madikizela-Mandela tied the knot with the late former president Nelson Mandela in 1958. The two divorced after Madiba s release from jail.NONDUMISO ZWANE
