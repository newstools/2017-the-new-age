Nigeria&#8217;s President Muhammadu Buhari will return to his official duties as soon as doctors advise that he can end his medical leave, according to a statement from the presidency on Tuesday.Amid conflicting reports on the health of the 74-year-old president, his office released a photograph on Sunday &#8211; the first for almost three months &#8211; showing a smiling Buhari looking less gaunt than when he was last seen on television in Nigeria.Buhari left Abuja for London on May 7 for treatment of an unspecified illness, his second trip abroad this year for health reasons. The first trip, also to London, lasted nearly two months and a number of photographs of him were published.&#8220;I am making good progress, and as soon as doctors advise, I shall return to my duties and continue serving the Nigerian people who elected me and are daily praying for my recovery,&#8221; Buhari said in a letter to Guinea President Alpha Conde, dated July 24, according to the presidency statement.Buhari, a former military ruler who took office in May 2015, handed over to his deputy, Yemi Osinbajo, to allay concerns about a possible power vacuum in his absence.With the economy in recession, Nigerian authorities are also fighting an Islamist insurgency in the northeast and trying to maintain a fragile ceasefire by militants whose attacks in the Niger Delta last year cut oil production by more than a third.The refusal of officials to disclose details of Buhari&#8217;s illness has triggered fierce speculation in Nigeria&#8217;s media and on social media over the last few months about whether he will seek a second term in the 2019 election.-Reuters
