With just only two days to go to the ANC 54th National Elective Conference Secretary General Gwede Mantashe has assured that there will be no shootouts. Mantashe said this during the National Executive Committee (NEC) members walk about in Nasrec, South of Johannesburg. “There will be no shoot-out this weekend, there are two Presidential Candidates and we will have a new President by Sunday.” Former African Union Chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma and Current ANC Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa are expected to contest the party’s presidency position. Ramaphosa is currently leading the nomination and he enjoys the support of five provinces, while Dlamini Zuma enjoys the support of four provinces. However, three provinces that support Dlamini Zuma are being contested in court, North West, Free State and Kwa-Zulu Natal. Free State former deputy Chairperson Thabo Manyoni’s faction has on Tuesday filled papers which sought to ban all delegates in the province from attending the upcoming National conference and declare the provincial conference null and void. Magashule is stunt supporter of former AU chairperson and is nominated to take over from the current Secretary General Gwede Mantashe. He is expected to battle it out with former KZN premier and Chairperson Senzo Mchunu for the position. -Sipho Jack
