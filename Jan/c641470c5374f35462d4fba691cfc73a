The planned R569m hospital in the Bethal community, which falls under the Govan Mbeki municipal district in Mpumalanga is a reflection on the hard work the health department has recently been undertaking.The state of the art facility will be known as the Bethal Hospital upon its completion in 2019.Construction is expected to take 35 months, with 300 jobs in the pipeline.The MEC for health in the province said that the existing building would be demolished and replaced with the new structure.This will be done in three phases making sure there are no delays.The health department in Mpumalanga told The New Age that the new structure was necessary.The hospital was old, dilapidated and was an asbestos based structure.The department said that it had a plan in place to ensure that the project was completed according to the time frame. The department also said that community members in Bethal should not fear disruptions in the healthcare services during the period of remodelling. The construction plan is faced in a way that will not affect the running of hospital services during construction, the department said.The goal for this new facility, according to the department, was to improve service delivery. The department has a 10-year infrastructure plan for the province and it is working according to the priorities to achieve departmental goals, the department said. After the construction completion, there will be an improvement in the patient hospital flow, and better services, This upgrade comes after Mpumalanga spent most of 2016 setting out plans to improve the quality of health services are rendered.Another of the departments planned upgrades cames in the form of the setting aside of R64m to build a new hospital in Bushbuckridge.MEC Gillion Mashego had said his department was on a mission to renovate old structures and also build new ones throughout the province.The department has already spent about R70m revamping the Sabie Hospital and there are plans to renovate the Rob Ferreira Hospital in Mbombela, which experienced strikes last year.The health sector is vital for the future development of the country as it ensures that people are productive and can undertake economic activity and the government has identified health s importance, especially when it comes to hospitals and services they provide to the majority of South Africans.The National Development Plan states that a health system with positive health outcomes for the country is possible.The plan envisages a rise in life expectancy of South Africans to at least 70 years. It also seeks to have the under-20s generation largely free of HIV and reducing the burden of disease among others and the building of new facilities will go a long way in the achievement of the 2030 goal.Another avenue that the government would like to use is the National Health Insurance (NHI).The NHI aims to provide access to quality and affordable healthcare services for all South Africans based on their health needs irrespective of their socio-economic status.Durban played host to the 40th World Hospital Congress last year for the first time that this meeting was held on the African continent.Minister of Health Dr Aaron Motsoaledi said that hosting the congress provided an opportunity for deliberation on the role that the hospital sector should play in achieving the objective of universal access to quality and affordable healthcare. We have identified particularly that effective governance and performance of public hospitals will be greatly enhanced by increasing local decision-making and local accountability through decentralisation of management authority, the minister said.He said that: Public sector hospitals are still perceived to be disproportionately inefficient and slow in responding to national health priorities. The Hospital Association of South Africa, which accounts for about 80% of all private beds in the country, said last year: To seriously tackle such a project with anything less than the most rigorous approach is to embrace risk unnecessarily. Similarly, to ignore the inequities of the healthcare system is to harden against the fact that accessible, affordable, and quality healthcare is not as available to many South Africans as it should be. This was in response to the NHI proposal and vigorously debated by those in the medical and healthcare fraternity. Everyone involved in healthcare delivery should collaborate on strengthening healthcare in general and the public sector in particular. In our submission, we recommend the establishment of a forum drawn from the public and private sector whose leaders can collaborate on a road map of actions. provinces@thenewage.co.za
