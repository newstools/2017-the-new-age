A WOMAN who was arrested after allegedly being found in possession of dagga with an estimated street value of R1 500 in Tonga near Malelane on Monday was remanded in custody by the Nkomazi Magistrate s Court after she failed to pay her bail. The accused, Poppy Nkosi, 49, said she could not afford the R1000 bail.She was ordered to appear again in the same court on Tuesday pending further investigations on a charge of possession of dagga. Tonga police spokesperson Const Nomsa Lephoko said the woman was arrested at her home following a tip-off from concerned community members for allegedly selling dagga to their children.Lephoko said the suspect was arrested on the spot after a bucket containing dagga was discovered in her possession. Two police constables were performing routine stop and search duties around the area when they received a tip-off from a passer-by about a woman who was selling dagga. The police officers acted on the information and began a search of the woman s home. A bucket of dagga was found and this led to the arrest of the suspect, Lephoko said. She said the selling of dagga and other drugs was playing a vital role in the increase of crime in the area. The Tonga police station commander Brig Velisiwe Mdaka is discouraging the selling and use of dagga as it is a contributing factor to crime. We once again advise the residents to continue cooperating with the police so that those contributing to crime in the society can be arrested and punished accordingly, Lephoko said.francen@thenewage.co.za-France Nyaka
