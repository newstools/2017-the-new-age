Mayors are at the forefront and the centre of inspiring good governance, Xolile George, CEO of the South African Government Association (Salga), said.The is one of key focus points George and Parks Tau, president of Salga and United Cities and Local Government (UCLG), touched on at the latest business briefings brought by the SABC and The New Age (TNA).Four mayors also took part in a panel discussion.The discussion with mayors coincided with the inaugural council of mayors which was held at the same venue last Friday.Setting the tone for a lively debate Moegsien Williams, The New Age editor-in-chief, emphasised that these breakfast briefings were conceived and designed to provide an additional forum for debate and discussion.He said that over the years it had provided a unique opportunity for public representatives to speak and engage and debate before a live audience with their messages unfiltered.Williams said: The challenges faced by our cities and councils are enormous as they cope with rapid urbanisation, demanded by impatient communities for the provision of infrastructure and basic services, as well as the socio-economic problems we are experiencing as a developing society. These include high levels of unemployment and poverty which make it difficult for residents to pay for service delivery leaving municipalities with massive debt. It can be said, as public officials in local government, you bear the brunt of people. But many of the local governments in SA had to be built from scratch on the remnants of apartheid spatial development in cities and towns designed to enforce the separation of our people based on the colour of their skin. Touching on the inaugural gathering of the Council of Mayors, Tau said the new constitution of Salga makes provision for the establishment of the council. This platform gives Salga a broad view of the challenges municipalities face and the issues that affect communities.George said: Local government is quite a complicated system. You find more executive and legislative powers invested here than anywhere else and all of those require a different focus. It was therefore necessary for Salga to look at the hierarchy of these government structures. This requires focused engagement on areas that deal with the domain of that sector as well as on domain legislature and it has became necessary with 270 municipalities, that mayors in particular are at the forefront of leading, that they are at the centre of inspiring good governance. Also the complex nature of municipalities requires a greater degree of imagination so it needs positive experience of debt around that experience, sharing and innovation. The recent municipal elections has seen new faces enter as mayors and councillors and, according to George, Salga has prepared what it calls a governance constitution framework that looks at the pre-transition, the transition and post-transition.One of the key areas is that once councillors are elected, it s the duty of Salga to prepare the new councillors within the first 60 days for understanding the space within which they will be providing leadership. We are currently training the new councillors in portfolios where they are deployed, George said.Tau, as president of UCLG, said South Africa was doing very well in terms of its local government structures. The issue around whether municipalities were working together for the greater cause or whether we were seeing political battles playing out in municipalities was also raised.Particular emphasis was placed on recognising that these meetings have been quite robust. Tables have been literally turned over and some of the votings were more about fighting than about servicing the public.Responding to the contentious issue Tau said: Robustness comes from democracy. I m not sure about the tables. It s the more robust issues that get into the media and less the issues of cooperation and corroboration where you have a council meeting that goes without incident. The panel discussion with four mayors was wrapped up by them extending their gratitude to communities for their support and urging residents to continue paying for services.They raised the issue of getting rid of the corruption that was a stumbling block to service delivery.Concluding proceedings, the public protector and Salga signed a memorandum of understanding so that some of the pertinent issues and complaints could be speeded up and dealt with.VINCENT CRUYWAGENvincentc@thenewage.co.za@MoegsienW: Parks Tau: Council of mayors established to allow for direct contact between mayors to better deal with issues of local govts.@The_New_Age: Salga CEO, Xolile George: Local goverment is a complicated system.
