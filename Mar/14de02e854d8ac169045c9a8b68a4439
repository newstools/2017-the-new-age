British film icon James Bond has entertained audiences for over five decades, but now the country&#8217;s foreign intelligence agency is asking cinema-goers to become spies themselves.MI6 on Friday unveiled a 58-second advertisement &#8212; entitled &#8220;But She Can&#8221; &#8212; that will be shown in cinemas from Monday as part of a recruitment drive to attract budding spies from diverse backgrounds.&#8220;I want everyone to know that, regardless of background, if you have the skills we need and share our values, there is a future for you in MI6,&#8221; said agency chief Alex Younger as he unveiled the advertisement..&#8221;I want people to see our advert and know there is a place for them in our team.&#8221;Younger has previously blamed Bond for creating a stereotyped image of a British spy, and is keen to employ more female agents.He said the fictional spy gave a &#8220;misleading portrayal&#8221; of MI6, and that Bond would &#8220;have to change his ways&#8221; to survive in the modern agency.-AFP
