The mayor of London on Tuesday warned the European Union against punishing Britain in Brexit negotiations, saying that everyone would suffer the consequences.Speaking in Brussels a day before Britain triggers the two-year Brexit process, Sadiq Khan also urged Prime Minister Theresa May to give a &#8220;cast iron&#8221; guarantee of the rights of EU citizens living in Britain.&#8220;There is no need for the EU to send a message or to instil fear by punishing the UK,&#8221; Khan told an event run by the Politico Europe newspaper.&#8220;A bad Brexit deal that hurts London would hurt the EU too,&#8221; added Khan, who is meeting key EU figures including European Parliament chief Antonio Tajani while in Brussels.Khan warned that businesses driven out of London, one of the world&#8217;s leading financial centres, would &#8220;leave Europe altogether and go to New York and Singapore instead.&#8221;&#8220;A bad Brexit really is a lose-lose situation.&#8221;The London mayor, whose city voted overwhelmingly against Brexit in last year&#8217;s referendum, called on May to set a positive tone for the Brexit talks by quickly agreeing to protect the rights of the three million EU citizens in Britain, including one million in London.&#8220;It would be a perfect gesture of goodwill to provide a cast iron guarantee of their rights to remain in the UK,&#8221; Khan said.Khan also held a minute of silence for victims of last week&#8217;s attack outside the British parliament and said it was important for Britain and the EU to keep cooperating on security after Brexit.&#8211; &#8216;Very costly&#8217; &#8211;After meeting Khan, Tajani said that he would &#8220;work hard towards achieving a fair and orderly divorce between the European Union and the United Kingdom&#8221;.MEPs will have the final vote on any Brexit deal, and are also set to vote next week in Strasbourg on a resolution on their goals for the negotiations.Manfred Weber, the German head of the European People&#8217;s Party, the largest group in the parliament, warned Britain&#8217;s bill to leave would be &#8220;very costly&#8221;.The EU says Britain will have to agree to meet billions of euros of spending commitments made while still a member as part of the divorce.&#8220;In the last nine months we saw only the message about what they don&#8217;t like. Hopefully tomorrow we will have more idea about what they like,&#8221; Weber told reporters.&#8220;The promises of Brexit campaigners last year that it would be positive for the budget were a lie. It will be very costly for the British,&#8221; he said.Weber said it would be a in &#8220;both sides&#8217; interest to immediately clarify&#8221; the fate of EU nationals.-AFP
