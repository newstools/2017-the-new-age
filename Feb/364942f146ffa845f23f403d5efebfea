SAFA intends to crack the whip on match officials with the introduction of strict systems designed to curb corruption and match fixing.The association said referees will have to sign integrity declarations where they commit to uphold the values of ethical conduct and also confirm they understand that failure to report match fixing or attempts thereof will result in sanctions.Strong action is also being taken against individuals and clubs that have transgressed the Safa code of conduct and statutes and the outcomes of disciplinary cases will be shared extensively with the public.Match officials have invariably come under the spotlight for the wrong reasons, with many in the lower leagues often accused of corruption.Delays in the payment of referees has previously been identified as the root cause of the problem, which leaves many susceptible to bribery.But the football association is reviewing its statutes and governance regulations to ensure they are fully aligned with those of Fifa. The ethics and integrity framework of the association is one of the functions receiving attention.As part of this process, the review of the Safa Code of Ethics, the role and composition of the Safa Standing Committee on Ethics, Safety and Security and Fair Play as well as systems with respect to the refereeing function and general administration in our leagues and competitions is under way, Safa said.In an effort to enhance their capacity, Safa have organised workshops for all members of the referees panel officiating in the PSL and the National First Division.The first workshop was concluded in Pretoria last week while the second will start in KwaZulu-Natal this weekend. We have commenced with workshops to educate our match officials about their obligations in terms of the Safa statutes and article 18 of the Fifa Code of Ethics which deals with the duty of disclosure, cooperation and most importantly, to report maladministration, corruption and match fixing. The processes of appointing match officials for matches of the ABC Motsepe League and SAB League are also being tightened to eliminate any risks of irregular interference. We have appointed a team of administrators to urgently address the backlog of match reports that result in payments not being made.Match officials who have outstanding reports and payments are encouraged to cooperate with this process by ensuring that their tax, bank details, residential address and other compliance information is up to date. Meanwhile, Bafana Bafana are set for a busy year.Among the key matches scheduled for the year, Bafana will be involved in Chan tournament qualifiers in April, 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers and the resumption of the 2018 World Cup qualifiers in September.KGOMOTSO SETHUSHAkgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
