On the eve of semester exams, hungry and worried students threaten protest action because of delays in the payment of allowances by the National Student Financial Aid Scheme.Thousands of students across the country are about to enter the examination season without the necessary study material due to delays in the payment of their textbook and food allowances.Students from the University of Venda (Univen) and the Mangosuthu University of Technology (MUT) in Durban have embarked on protests demanding immediate payments.The higher education portfolio committee earlier this week placed the number of affected students across the country s tertiary institutions at 200000.Students Representative Council (SRC) president at Univen Mandla Shikwambana said they were aware of 2 640 students who were yet to receive their money.The South African Union of Students said the problem was a national crisis .General secretary Sthembiso Ndlovu said mass action from students from across the country was on the cards. We are considering to have all the universities joining protest actions at the start of the next term. We will not exclude the possibility of full-blown student action. NSFAS made a commitment earlier this year that meal and textbook allowances would be paid by the end of January. NSFAS spokesperson Kagisho Mamobolo yesterday dismissed accusations that it is to blame for the crisis. The delays in generating loan agreement forms (LAF) for university students and schedules of particulars for TVET college students were due to institutions struggling to use the upgraded modules on their business management systems because of proper training. We then provided professional training intervention to colleges, he said.LILLIAN SELAPISA
