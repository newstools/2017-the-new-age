The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has agreed with the motion to combine the two cases against Mark Zinde after his brief appearance at the Vereeniging Magistrate s Court on Wednesday.Zinde is accused of killing his mother Hope Zinde, a well known media personality, at their home in Peacanwood Estate in the North West in June 2016.Hope Zinde s body was found in a boot of a car and it is believed she was killed days before she was found.Her son was arrested and later released on R10 000 bail with conditions which was revoked after the assault of his father whom he was staying with after his bail release.Zinde is facing a charge of murder, possession of illegal drugs and for assault after attacking his father Dr. Lebohang Manoto late last year at his Johannesburg home.The assault case was postponed to the 26th of January.A decision to incorporate the cases was brought forth because Zinde is expected to undergo psychiatric evaluation at the Weskoppies Psychiatric Hospital.Zinde s lawyer has indicated that the application for psychiatric evaluation was brought forth by Hope Zinde back in 2013.The accused is expected to appear in the Brits Magistrate&#8217;s Court on 24 January when an application for admission to Weskoppies will be made.Zinde is set to be prosecuted in the North Gauteng High Court for the centralisation of the charges.-AFP
