TOMORROW, a monthly music event, The Jump Off, will hold its last session The Jump Off Presents – Pandemonium Hip Hop Pool Splash for the year at Club Icon in Pimville, Soweto. The line-up of DJs who will rock their hip hop sets are DJ Zan-D, Dimplez, Sindiso, Fanatic, DJ MRX, Sean Kross, Louis Da XVI, Bhuts Tunz, 2PM Duo, Dirty Harry, King Levi, Andzo K and The Brownies among others. Event organiser Tshepo Lethoko promised hip hop music lovers a night filled with some of the best local DJs and superstars such as YFM’s DJ Zan-D and DJ Dimplez. “This will be our last event for the year,” Lethoko said. “So we are going all out to make it a big hip hop show for our loyal fans who have been supporting us throughout the monthly events we have been hosting in Pimville.” Lethoko said although the event was dominated by hip hop DJs, music fans can still expect a bit of kwaito, house and gqom to filter into the DJ sets amid a pool party themed vibe. “We will be catering to house music fans as well as gqom lovers as we want to give people the time of their lives. This is bigger than our normal monthly events.” siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
