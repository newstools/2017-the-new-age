A five-year-old child was stabbed to death by an Afghan national at a refugee shelter in southeastern Germany, German authorities said Sunday.The 41-year-old assailant also injured the child&#8217;s mother, a Russian national, and a six-year-old child at the scene was treated for shock and taken to hospital.Police said they did not know why the man carried out the attack, but said it had to do with a dispute at the refugee shelter in Arnschwang, near the Czech border, where asylum seekers live.Germany has taken in more than one million asylum seekers since 2015, many from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, sparking an anti-foreigner backlash and a spate of racist hate crimes.-AFP
