A security guard at OR Tambo has been arrested after posting pictures of himself with a brand new R5-million suspicious Lamborghini on social media.The suspect was arrested a few hours after he had post a photo of himself and his friend posing with the Lamborghini at Blue Valley Estate in Midrand.The guard is one of the five suspects arrested for the heist that occurred at OR Tambo International Airport on March 7 in which R20-million in foreign currency was stolen.According to reports a large amount of money was also seized during the arrest.The Hawks would not confirm or deny the arrest, but police have said investigations are ongoing.Last week two suspects also linked to the heist were released on R50 000 bail each at the Kempton Park Magistrate s Court.Authorities have withheld the names of the four men held, saying it was a sensitive investigation and disclosing names could potentially jeopardise the investigation.Police have so far arrested nine suspects in connection with the heist.The two suspects are due back in court Friday, March 24.Acting national police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane said it was highly regrettable that a member of the South African Police Service was among the first two suspects arrested.5 more arrested in connection with the heist are security officers. This confirms our version of not ruling out the possibility of collusion or an inside job, Phahlane said.Phahlane is set to brief the media on Monday on the breakthrough.TNA Reporter
