Amid the strongest ever campaigns (#FeesMustFall campaign) waged through social media platforms in South Africa, many questions still remain unanswered, this despite the resumption of the academic year.Most universities have announced an 8% increase in fees for the 2017 academic year. This announcement was made following the statement last year by Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande.He said that individual universities could determine what percentage they increase the fees by provided it was capped at a maximum of 8%.He also had said that for some categories of needy students there would be no increase. However, the unfortunate thing is that the increase comes during quite a volatile environment in institutions of higher education.The greatest fear is that this may exacerbate the already tense situation at hand.It was also interesting to see the campaign manifesting itself into multiple facets.Among others, we saw the campaign bring into centre stage an old debate of decolonisation of education.At the same time, the campaign elevated the anger of the radical young female activists across racial lines, reminding us of the generation of 1976 students uprisings that took to the streets and ultimately changed the sociopolitical landscape in South Africa.Leigh-Ann Naidoo does acknowledge this in her piece Contemporary Student Politics in South Africa in a book titled Student Must Rise that there was a significant change in thinking about education and society from 1969 onwards.This was when the South African Students Organisation (Saso) stopped fighting for equality in education, or education equal to white education, and started criticising white privileged education as a domesticating or dominating education . This is an indication that discontent among black South Africans has been brewing for years.It is during this protest (#FeesMustFall) that students began to question the 1994 project(of democracy and reconciliation), asking questions such as, what has it achieved, and what is still outstanding?Did we expedite the real needs of post-1994 students? Was the change that took place after the new dispensation merely cosmetic, just opening doors of higher learning to people of previously disadvantaged backgrounds without taking into consideration their socioeconomic?These questions have been dominating the #FeesMustFall activities.Clearly, there is an urgent need for a meaningful community engagement. It the duty of a caring community to build ongoing, permanent relations with the purpose of building a culture of inter-generational dialogue.Just as was the case during the times of the struggle against apartheid, sustainable community-based structures have to be built to focus specifically on all levels of education.It cannot be that we build structures such as community policing forums and yet ignore important sectors such as education in a developmental state like ours.Before 1994 most people from disadvantaged communities were depended on long distance learning to develop themselves, and this is a model that the University of South Africa (Unisa) has mastered and continues to do so in a technologically-driven era.This brings me back to the question, do we need warm bodies attending lectures under the roofs of universities or can the same quality of education be delivered through other technological means like e-learning which can provide a more affordable alternative to those who are finding the cost of attending institutions of higher learning unaffordable taking into account factors such as accommodation, meals, security, overcrowding, security and general expenses?Advancement in technology has changed the approach to tuition and course content delivery. Research does show that blended instruction could offer advantages to institution of higher learning and student body.It is time that our knowledge industry is made convenient and accessible to the needy. It is high time that the government and other role players within the education sector explore other options such as e-learning, especially to students who have an interest to further their education in institutions of higher learning.While we are await the outcome of the Presidential Commission and other initiatives undertaken to quell the situation, we cannot as society fold our arms. We need to encourage ecumenical dialogues among stakeholders within the higher education sector, and these dialogues should be embedded within our communities/townships since institutions of higher learning exist within our communities.Transformation of education is everybody s business.Qondile KhedamaQondile Khedama is a communications practitioner, social commentator and founder of the Bram Fischer Foundation.
