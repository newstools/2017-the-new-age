The latest model from Citroen&#8217;s standalone luxury brand wants to be to the premium SUV sector what Parisian haute couture is to the fashion world.Like any car pitched at those that would otherwise be considering an Audi Q5 or a BMW X3 as their next vehicular investment, the DS 7 Crossback is overflowing with creature comforts and active safety technology. For example, it can automatically maintain a safe distance from the car in front in traffic jam conditions or at speeds in excess of 100mph and can stay within its lane without driver input.It can also maneuver itself into a parallel or perpendicular parking space and, best of all, has a trick suspension setup. A high-mounted camera scans the road ahead for bumps and potholes and uses the information to pre-adjust damping and spring travel so that the car glides rather than shakes over uneven surfaces.But it&#8217;s how all these features are being packaged, rather than the features themselves, that DS wants to highlight.&#8220;Each material and each detail of DS 7 Crossback was inspired by the world of Haute Couture whose rigor and sensuality is visible in the very smallest detail,&#8221; said Thierry Metroz, Director of Style, DS Automobiles.That&#8217;s why rather than textured plastics, DS has dressed the cabin in wood, leather and Alcantara and has gone for two large multimedia screens in the console, because it minimizes the clutter created by row upon row of physical switches, buttons and dials.&#8220;Each DS combines a wide and unique range of French craftsmanship techniques to reflect the individual expectations of each customer. Our talented designers, engineers and upholsterers, have applied their considerable expertise to the vehicle interior, using premium materials and implementing the meticulous approach of true craftsmanship,&#8221; said Metroz.However the first potent, all-wheel drive hybrid model is still two years away.But when it does arrive, it will use electric motors to power the rear wheels and a traditional engine to power those at the front. When working together the car will have 300hp on tap and will be able to cover up to 37 miles on electric power alone.&#8220;[It will be a] car in which power goes hand-in-hand with real performance, respects the environment and provides increased safety,&#8221; said Eric Apode, VP, Products and Business Development.-Relaxnews
