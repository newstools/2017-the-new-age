The Hawks have confirmed that the 23 year old man arrested for allegedly plotting to assassinate 19 cabinet ministers is the leader of both organisations which have been implicated in the investigation. ” There are two organisations that we are talking about; the Anti-State Capture Death Squad Alliance that had 19 people targetted as well as the Anti-White Monoploy Capitalist Regieme that had targetted 4 people. This is the same person its not two different organisations that were plotting the assasinations.” said Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi On Wednesday the Hawks arrested the suspect in Midrand, Johannesburg while explaining to a number of donors how the assassination of state capture beneficiaries was going to be carried out. The suspect is alleged to have sent a series of letters to selected companies to donate money to fund the operation. ” We picked up the information in October last year and we have been monitoring the suspect since then.” said Mulaudzi. According to the Hawks the suspect intended to assassinate up to 23 South Africans who were implicated in former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela’s State capture report. ” There is a perception that only nineteen people who are being targeted. We are talking about 23 people who have been targeted these are politicians, ordinary South Africans and cabinet ministers, ” said Mulaudzi. The suspect is expected to appear in court on Friday to face charges of conspiracy to commit murder.  -TNA Reporter
