Such swift arrests, particularly in relation to violent crimes, epitomise the SAPS resolve to put behind bars those that continue to undermine the laws of the country towards ensuring safer communities. It is on this score that the police in Gauteng are determined to make sure that the consequent investigation yields qualifying conviction of the suspects.&#8221;Operation Paseka is already underway to enhance police visibility and deal with criminality during school holidays and Easter weekend.&#8220;We appeal to members of the community to assist the police with any information that could lead to the identification and or arrest of suspects in relation to all criminal activities,&#8221; said Motsepe.-TNA Reporter
