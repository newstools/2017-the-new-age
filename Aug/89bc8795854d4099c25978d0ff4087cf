The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) has decried the lack of culpability for the Marikana massacre five years on from that fateful day.NUMSA today joined South Africans across the country in paying tribute to the 34 striking miners who were killed on 16th August 2012 and decried the delay in bringing to book those responsible.&#8220;This is because the victims are largely poor and African, and that is why there is no political will to ensure that justice is served,&#8221; said NUMSA general secretary, Irvin Jim.Yesterday rights group Amnesty International also bemoaned the lack of progress in ensuring justice for the slain miners and reparations for the affected families. If the South African government wants to demonstrate that it is committed to truth and human rights, it needs to ensure that the wheels of justice start turning far faster than they have done over the past five years, said Executive Director of Amnesty International South Africa, Shenilla Mohamed.The executive director of the Bench Marks Foundation, John Capel has also criticised how little had been done to ensure that the living conditions of Marikana workers had improved describing it as appalling, with at least 30000 people still living in shacks .He blamed state authorities, Lonmin and its parent company in London and the German company BASF, the main buyer of the platinum. He said the government had a legal obligation to improve living conditions in Marikana, including providing housing and other basic services.Meanwhile NUMSA today has also come out with a scathing criticism of Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa.The union says he played a central role in the events leading up to the miners ultimately being killed and he has yet to properly atone for his actions.&#8220;As NUMSA we believe that Ramaphosa has yet to take full responsibility for the role he played in the mass murder of workers in Marikana and that is why we reject his apology,&#8221; said Jim.Earlier this year Ramaphosa issued an apology for the language he used, which he said was inappropriate and unfortunate when he called for police intervention in the Marikana strikes.Last week The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) announced that the widow s of the miners did not want Ramaphosa to attend today&#8217;s commemoration.Thousands of mineworkers will today gather at Wonderkop hill in remembrance of those who died at the hands of the police on August 16, 2012.-TNA Reporter
