The Hawks have confirmed the arrest of alleged &#8216;sex pest&#8217; pastor Tim Omotoso.Lieutenant Colonel Robert Netshiunda said: &#8220;We can confirm that we made the arrest and he is currently in custody.&#8221;Earlier unconfirmed reports say that the Jesus Dominion International pastor will be appearing in Port Elizabeth Magistrate Court on Thursday.Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities (CRL) is also investigating allegations against the pastor.He is accused of molesting more than 30 young girls on the pretext of rescuing them from drugs. Some of those women are reportedly as young as 14-years-old.Some of the girls had also reportedly dropped out of the University of KwaZulu-Natal while others began travelling while singing for the pastor s group, known as Simply Christolite.Commission chair Thoko Mkhwanazi Xaluva said &#8220;the outcomes should send a strong message in this country, you do not do that to our children.&#8221;She said: &#8220;You don&#8217;t use God and you don&#8217;t use Jesus Christ to do your evil, if you want to be evil, be evil on your own don&#8217;t invite the father, the son and the holy spirit in your evilness,&#8221; said Xaluva.The church said at this stage they cannot comment on the allegations and referred all questions to the Pastor&#8217;s lawyer.Meanwhile Hawk s spokesperson Lt-Col Robert Netshiunda said Omotoso had gone to ground and all three cellphones linked to him had been deactivated. We are investigating the matter and we will only lay charges after getting him, Netshiunda said.Tim Omotoso is the founder and also the senior pastor of Jesus Dominion International Church which has branches in the UK, France and across South Africa.In an expose on SABC&#8217;s Special Assignment, one of the women who said she took the pastor as father figure, accused him of seducing her at the age of 14.&#8220;I was very young and I wasn&#8217;t mentally capable of understanding what was going on and I didn&#8217;t have the mental capacity of taking everything,&#8221; said the young woman.It is reported that the young women who are from Port Elizabeth, Durban and Secunda in Mpumalanga, have opened cases against the pastor.TNA Reporter
