Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Wednesday condemned Donald Trump&#8217;s move to build a border wall but fell short of deciding whether to cancel an upcoming meeting with the US president.Opposition leaders called on Pena Nieto to cancel Tuesday&#8217;s trip after Trump issued a widely expected order to begin work on the massive wall.Without mentioning the trip, Pena Nieto said he would wait for a report from a high-level Mexican delegation holding meetings in the US capital this week and consult with governors and lawmakers before deciding on &#8220;the next steps to take.&#8221;&#8220;I regret and condemn the decision of the United States to continue construction of a wall that, for years, has divided us instead of uniting us,&#8221; Pena Nieto said in a brief televised message.&#8220;Mexico does not believe in walls. I have said it time and again: Mexico will not pay for any wall,&#8221; he said, referring to Trump&#8217;s vow to make the southern neighbor pay for the barrier.&#8220;Mexico gives and demands respect as the completely sovereign nation that we are,&#8221; Pena Nieto said.Pena Nieto said he ordered Mexico&#8217;s 50 consulates in the United States to act as legal counsel for the rights of migrants.&#8220;Our communities are not alone. The government of Mexico will offer legal counsel that will guarantee the protection they need,&#8221; he said.AFP
