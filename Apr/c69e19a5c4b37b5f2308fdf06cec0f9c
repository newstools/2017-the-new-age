The soccer fraternity in the country is on Tuesday commemorating the 16th anniversary of the 43 soccer supporters that perished at the Ellis Park stadium.Kaizer Chiefs Chairman Kaizer Motaung said: &#8220;It is one of the saddest days in South African football, It is a fateful day where supporters lost their lives for the love of soccer and for their favourite teams.On this day in 2001 43 soccer supporters perished at the Ellis Park stadium in a stampede during a derby match between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates.Its has been 16 years since the incident happened and the soccer fraternity remembers those that lost their lives for the love of the game.&#8220;This is one event that always reminds us of who we are and how far we have come to be here. Such events always refresh our humility before the Almighty, whose presence carries us through the good and the dark days. This indeed was one of the darkest days and we will never ever forget that,&#8221; said Motaung.The PSL has since improved security measures in stadiums after experiencing such an unfortunate event.It is believed that the stampede was caused by a large number of spectators who tried to cramp the stadium, about 80 000 spectators tried to force their way into the stadium that accommodates only about 60 000 people. Fans outside the stadium then got impatient while the match started without them.Motuang added that as the souls of the departed Rest In Peace, we will always bear in mind that people have paid the ultimate price for the sake of soccer.&#8220;On behalf of the Kaizer Chiefs fraternity, I send my heartfelt Love and Peace to all concerned in remembrance of this day,&#8221; he said.-TNA Reporter
