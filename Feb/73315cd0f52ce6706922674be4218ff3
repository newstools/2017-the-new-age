E-cigarettes are safer and less toxic than conventional cigarettes, a study in the UK has found.The study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine has found e-cigarettes may be useful aids for smokers who struggle to quit smoking.It also found that former smokers who totally replaced normal cigarettes with e-cigarettes substantially reduced their intake of toxic chemicals compared to those who continued to smoke normal cigarettes.Researchers found that former smokers who switched to e-cigarettes for at least six months had lower levels of cancer causing chemicals in their body compared to those who continued to smoke normal cigarettes.Urine and saliva samples of e-cigarette smokers and tobacco smokers were analysed during the study which found that those who smoked e-cigarettes had much less toxic and carcinogenic chemicals in their bodies.Dr Lion Shahab, senior lecture in the department of epidemiology and public health at UCL and lead author of the study, said: Our study adds to existing evidence showing e-cigarettes and NRT are far safer than smoking, and suggests there is a very low risk associated with their long-term use. The study has stirred the debate about the use of e-cigarettes after previous studies found the vapour from e-cigarettes contained carcinogenic chemicals Dr Shahab however disagrees. We ve shown that the levels of toxic chemicals in the body from e-cigarettes are considerably lower than suggested in previous studies using simulated experiments. This means some doubts about the safety of e-cigarettes may be wrong. He said the study also suggested the amount of nicotine e-cigarettes provide is not noticeably different to conventional cigarettes. This can help people to stop smoking altogether by dealing with their cravings in a safer way, he said.According to the World Health Organisation, tobacco kills around 6 million people each year with 80% of the more than 1 billion smokers living in low and middle income countries.Alison Cox, Cancer Research UK s director of cancer prevention, said: This study adds to growing evidence that e-cigarettes are a much safer alternative to tobacco, and suggests the long term effects of these products will be minimal.
