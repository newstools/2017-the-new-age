KwaZulu-Natal police are refusing to be drawn in on Monday s drama at the Scottburgh Magistrate s Court where a group of awaiting-trial prisoners angered by the lengthy period of time the court was taking to conclude their cases reportedly attacked prosecutors with chairs during court proceedings. It is difficult for us to provide any details about the incident if the victims have not yet opened a case, provincial police spokesperson Lt-Col Thulani Zwane said. According to our records, no case has been opened. The more than 20 prisoners who are facing cable theft charges were reported to have been angered by the prosecutors decision after the accused had been awaiting trial for more than five years. All we can say at this stage is that two prosecutors were transported to hospital where they are receiving medical attention, National Prosecuting Authority provincial spokesperson Natasha Kara said.The incident is one of a series in recent months that has thrown the spotlight on security in court rooms.Last week, eight awaiting-trial prisoners escaped from the cells at the Durban Central police station after overpowering a police officer who had been guarding them. Five are still at large.In the same week, eight illegal immigrants who were being transported by Home Affairs officials from Durban to the Lindela Repatriation Centre for deportation escaped when one of the vans they were in slowed down at the Mooi River toll plaza along the N3.All of the escapees have been rearrested.In June, a video showing two robbery suspects escaping from a police van in Pinetown went viral on social media.The awaiting-trial prisoners in the Scottburgh Magistrate s Court drama are accused of being part of a cable-theft syndicate in the province.Clive Ndounews@thenewage.co.za
