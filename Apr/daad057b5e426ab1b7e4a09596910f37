The mayor of Seattle in the US state of Washington is accused of sexually abusing a minor in a case that dates back three decades, allegations he vehemently denied Friday.The lawsuit was filed in King County Superior Court under the man&#8217;s initials &#8220;D.H.&#8221; The plaintiff, who is now 46, alleges that Seattle Mayor Ed Murray paid him for sex when the man was a 15-year-old drug-addicted, homeless teenager.According to the lawsuit, Murray met and befriended D.H. on a bus, invited the teenager to his home and propositioned him for sex in exchange for money.Because the adolescent was addicted to drugs, the complaint said, he was &#8220;willing to do whatever Mr Murray asked for as little as $10-20.&#8221;Court documents say that encounters between the two &#8220;continued for an extended period of time.&#8221;Murray, a progressive and openly homosexual Democrat who is running for re-election this year, told journalists that the accusations were &#8220;simply not true,&#8221; saying that they were &#8220;painful for me, for my husband.&#8221;&#8221;I understand the individual making these allegations is troubled,&#8221; said the mayor, who is 61 years old. &#8220;To be on the receiving end of such untrue allegations is very painful for me.&#8221;He vowed to continue his bid to stay the city&#8217;s mayor: &#8220;I will continue to run this city; I will continue to run for re-election,&#8221; he said.&#8221;Things have never come easy to me in life, but I have never backed down and I will not back down.&#8221;Jeffrey Simpson, 49, also accused the mayor of having sexually assaulted him as a minor.The resident of Portland, in the neighboring state of Oregon, spoke on local television without revealing his face.The mayor&#8217;s lawyer Robert Sulkin dismissed the accusations and noted the timing of the lawsuit: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a coincidence that these allegations have occurred in the midst of a mayoral campaign.&#8221;In a letter to Sulkin dated Friday, the lawyer of D.H., Lincoln Beauregard, said his client was ready to make a filmed statement as soon as possible, potentially next week.-AFP
