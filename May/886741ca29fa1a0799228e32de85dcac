Golden Arrows left back Nkosinathi Mthiyane says the point gained against Kaizer Chiefs last week has lifted the spirits in the camp.Before visiting Chiefs at FNB Stadium, Arrows were low on confidence, having lost 3-1 to Polokwane City and suffered a home 2-0 loss to Mamelodi Sundowns. The slump in form was perceived by many as distractions since Arrows are one game away from reaching their maiden Nedbank Cup final. They host Orlando Pirates in the cup semifinals in KwaMashu on May 21. Despite trailing, Arrows never gave up and were duly rewarded when they snatched an equaliser in injury time.It was from Mthiyane s delivery that Zimbabwean Knox Mutizwa headed home. With two matches to wrap up the PSL season and the dream of finishing inside the top eight still alive, Mthiyane said they needed to tackle the remaining matches with their confidence high. Arrows host relegation-threatened Baroka FC at Princess Magogo Stadium on Saturday needing maximum points at all costs. It s going to be war since we are both fighting for points for our respective objectives. We are hungry for the top eight. Though I was not with the team when they narrowly missed out on top eight finish last season, they are still hurting. We want to make up, Mthiyane said. The former Chippa United man who has filled in perfectly for injured Lehlohonolo Nonyane at left back since joining from Orlando Pirates on loan, said Arrows were concerned about teams above them who are not dropping points.Abafana Besithende are ninth on the log with 32 points from 27 matches. Before their away game to title-chasing Sundowns, Baroka were 15th with 23 points. The two sides played to a 1-1 draw in Limpopo earlier this season.-LINDA XIMBA|news@thenewage.co.za
