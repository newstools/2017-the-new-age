Pepsi said on Wednesday it was dropping an ad featuring the supermodel Kendall Jenner that appeared to use the &#8220;Black Lives Matter&#8221; protests to promote the soda brand.The spot provoked an outcry and widespread derision on social media claiming Pepsi was seeking to profit from the social justice movement.&#8220;Pepsi was trying to project a global message of unity, peace and understanding. Clearly we missed the mark, and we apologize,&#8221; the Pepsico unit said in a statement.&#8220;We did not intend to make light of any serious issue. We are removing the content and halting any further rollout. We also apologize for putting Kendall Jenner in this position.&#8221;In the spot, Jenner, daughter of the transgender star Caitlyn Jenner, and the half-sister of reality TV star Kim Kardashian, is seen walking through a street protest and handing a can of Pepsi to a police officer, to the cheers from the crowd.Among those mocking the ad was Bernice King, daughter of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King, who tweeted: &#8220;If only Daddy would have known about the power of #Pepsi,&#8221; with a picture of her father being pushed by a police officer.Other social media users also found the ads in poor taste. Some said the final scene evoked an image from the &#8220;Black Lives Matter&#8221; movement when a female nurse walked up to a line of police officers in Louisiana last year.&#8220;Could you be any more blatant with the disrespect and appropriation of a movement, @pepsi? Is this a sick joke?!&#8221; one tweet said.Another user tweeted: &#8220;can&#8217;t believe Kendall Jenner just solved institutionalized racism and oppression by giving a cop a pepsi. Groundbreaking.&#8221;-AFP
