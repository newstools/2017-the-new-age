Paris St Germain will be well-equipped to renew battle with Barcelona in their Champions League round of 16 first leg at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday after key midfielder Marco Verratti made a well-timed return to the team.Two years ago, Barcelona humbled PSG 3-1 in Paris in the first leg of their quarter-final tie when the French champions were without talismanic forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Verratti, and saw captain Thiago Silva limp off the pitch after 21 minutes.Barca won the return 2-0 to eliminate PSG for the second time in three years at the same stage of Europe&#8217;s premium club competition.Verratti made his comeback from a calf injury in Friday&#8217;s 3-0 rout of Girondins de Bordeaux, showing his best in a 60-minute appearance with a splendid assist for Edinson Cavani.&#8220;He is a very intelligent player. I watch how he plays with and without the ball. He is really very, very strong. Playing with him is an absolute pleasure,&#8221; Julian Draxler, himself in impressive form since his January switch from Wolfsburg, said of the Italy international.Uruguay striker Cavani is in the form of his life, having scored a double against Bordeaux to take his league season tally to 25 goals.Only the suspended Thiago Motta and long-tem injured Javier Pastore will be missing on Tuesday.Barca are also in good form after demolishing Alaves 6-0 in La Liga on Saturday but suffered the loss for five months of fullback Aleix Vidal, who sustained a nasty ankle injury.Gerard Pique, who was rested against Alaves, is back in the squad, along with another defender, Rafinha, who has recovered from a broken nose.The firepower of Luis Suarez, Lionel Messi and Neymar ensure Luis Enrique&#8217;s side enter the tie as obvious favourites but PSG winger Angel Di Maria believes the game will be a good opportunity for his team to make amends for recent failures against the Spanish club.&#8220;Obviously it&#8217;s talked about in the dressing room, but each year it&#8217;s different,&#8221; he said, referring to PSG&#8217;s elimination by Barca in 2013 and 2015.&#8220;It&#8217;s a new era, with new players and it&#8217;s a new opportunity for everyone.&#8221;The return leg will be played at the Camp Nou on March 8.-Reuters
