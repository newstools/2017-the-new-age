Disciplinary proceedings against Sibusiso Chonco, a Department of Public Works employee who is accused of acting unlawfully during the Nkandla homestead upgrade, has been postponed.Chairman of the hearings, Thulani Khuzwayo on Tuesday ruled that the hearing adjourned until July when they will resume from the 4th to the 6th.This comes after the hearings were postponed on Monday when Chonco failed to attend due to falling sick.On Tuesday Chonco, who was in attendance, requested through his lawyer, Adrian Moodley, for a further postponement citing medical reasons.&#8221; The only reason why Mr Chonco is here today is because you, chair, requested that he attend today. He respects the process.&#8221;&#8220;Mr Chonco is not flouting this process. Not being able (to attend) and refusing are two very different things,&#8221; said MoodleyMoodley added that Chonco&#8217;s ability to remember proceedings was &#8220;critical&#8221; if he was going to defend himself and be treated fairly.Chonco was then directly questioned by Khuzwayo whether he wanted proceedings to continue. Chonco said he did not feel well.Following a brief break, Khuzwayo ruled that the hearings should be postponed in order to give Chonco a chance to have a fair hearing.&#8221; It would seem rather prejudicial to the employee if these proceedings were proceeded with in this present condition. In my view, the employee seems to be genuinely sick .. .therefore I think the employee should be afforded the opportunity to present his case in these proceedings, when and if he is in a proper condition to do so,&#8221; said Khuzwayo.-TNA Reporter
