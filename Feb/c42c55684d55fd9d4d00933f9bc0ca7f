A PASSION for radio drove Daniel Nel to give up his profession of financial broker to rock the airwaves of RadioTeemaneng Stereo in Kimberley. Nel said he believes in building the community and radio is the right place for him to play that role.He has been nominated for the National Community Radio Awards to be held later this month is Bloemfontein. He said the nomination would go a long way in making sure that he continues serving his listeners with good music and a great company. My first show on air I said to listeners I need something for the community, as I speak for the community. I had the initiative of creating Claim Your Fame, which is about sourcing any local talent in all categories and to give them the break they ve been waiting for, Nel said.He said the nomination is also the fruits of hard work he had to put in and dedication as well as sacrifices he had made to serve the people.Nel started as a volunteer with Radio Teemaneng Stereo and with his passion for radio, he soon hosted his own show in November last year. I had a clear picture of how I wanted my show to be and with the brilliant and professional support from Radio Teemaneng Stereo, this show was a big hit from the start.I remember sitting in their offices doing breathing exercises and countless voice recording exercises to get me ready for air, he said. Nel urged community members to vote for him so that he can walk away with the award for the people. My utmost wish is to bring this accolade and award to Kimberley, Northern Cape, and more importantly for my loyal listeners and supporters, he said.Fans and supporters wishing to vote for Nel can sms his personal code BESNel on 33083.
