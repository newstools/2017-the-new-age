The inability of many women in developing countries access cancer drugs especially trastuzumab due to exorbitant drug prices has been taken to the UN.The recently established Tobeka Daki Campaign for Access to Trastuzumab has written to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra ad Al Hussein, calling on the world body to take action.It described the deaths of a large number of women diagnosed with breast cancer because of the high price of the medicine as a gross injustice. This campaign was set up in memory of activist Tobeka Daki who was diagnosed with cancer, but died in November last year as she was unable to afford the prescribed trastuzumab drug. Daki from East London died three years after her diagnosis with HER2+ breast cancer.Trastuzumab, which is a prescribed World Health Organisation drug, is key in treating breast cancer. In South Africa, the annual price charged by Swiss multinational company Roche in the private sector is around $38 365 (R500000). The few public facilities which can access trastuzumab do so at a lower price of around $15 735. But, health economists have shown that a year s worth of trastuzumab can be produced and sold for only $240, a price that includes a 50% increase above the cost of production for profit, the letter to the UN said.Local health lobby groups have been vocal about the need to reform South Africa s patent laws in a bid to ensure better access to affordable drugs.The letter said that Roche s patents on trastuzumab could block other companies from entering the country s market until 2033. It said that the situation was bleak even in countries where the company s patents had expired. In countries where patents have expired or do not exist, Roche is using long, complicated litigation to block potentially more affordable biosimilar versions from coming to market. In Brazil and Argentina, Roche is one of the pharmaceutical companies litigating against those governments for their attempts to use TRIPS flexibilities legal international safeguards to protect public health, the letter said.Roche has previously hit back at the criticism saying a collaborative approach was needed.TNA REPORTERnews@thenewage.co.za
