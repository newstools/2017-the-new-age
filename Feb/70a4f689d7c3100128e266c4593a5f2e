South Africa s Post Office Group plans to register its financial services unit as a bank by July 3, a document handed out in Parliament yesterday showed.Such a move would put the company in the middle of a fiercely competitive market.The restructuring of Postbank is part of the government s strategy to provide a wider range of accessible, relevant and affordable financial services products to those without bank accounts and low-income earners.But it also leads the organisation down a highly competitive path dominated by five established banks, Barclays Africa, Standard Bank, Nedbank, FirstRand and Capitec.CEO Mark Barnes is pinning his hopes on the state-owned company s network of 2500 branches that gives it a presence in almost every town and city in the country.Postbank has R1.4bn in excess capital, enough to meet the regulatory minimum requirements for a bank, the document showed.Barnes, who was appointed in 2015 and has extensive experience in banking, told MPs the company s ability to reach the remotest areas also puts it an ideal position to start distributing government welfare grants. We have the best footprint, we have the most points of presence and have some experience in social grant disbursements, he said.The Post Office said it had regularised its relationship with the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa and was poising itself to become the government s delivery partner of choice and was investing to turn itself into Africa s e-commerce hub.The number of employees has been reduced by 1794 to 18987, while 768 employees have taken voluntary severance packages.Negotiations with organised labour were due to start this month. with ReutersDENNIS CRUYWAGENnews@thenewage.co.za
