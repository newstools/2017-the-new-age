South African batsman Hashim Amla cracked his maiden Twenty20 century but his sublime knock for his Indian Premier League side Kings XI Punjab went in vain.Amla hit a 60-ball 104 not out to help Punjab post 198-4 but Mumbai Indians achieved the target with 27 balls to spare during their eight-wicket win in Indore on Thursday.England&#8217;s Jos Buttler top-scored for Mumbai with a 37-ball 77 as he put together an 85-run second-wicket stand with left-handed batsman Nitish Rana (62 not out).But it was Amla&#8217;s eye-catching innings that remained the highlight of the evening at Indore&#8217;s Holkar Stadium that saw 397 runs in 35.3 overs.Amla, 34, known for his classical style of play, hit 8 fours and 6 sixes to single-handedly destroy the Mumbai bowling attack, with New Zealand paceman Mitchell McClenaghan and Sri Lankan speedster Lasith Malinga bleeding runs.Amla enjoyed an 83-run stand with skipper Glenn Maxwell, who hit 40 in 18 balls with 4 fours and 3 sixes for the third wicket.Congratulatory messages flowed as Amla, whose highest score in T20 internationals is 97 not out, registered his first hundred in his 113th T20 game.&#8220;Hashim Aaaaaaaaamla&#8230; What a player, what a champion! @amlahash @IPL,&#8221; South African one-day international captain AB de Villiers wrote on Twitter.Proteas Test and T20 skipper Faf du Plessis, who plays for IPL side Rising Pune Supergiant, declared Amla a &#8220;legend&#8221; while Morne Morkel also sang praises for his teammate.-AFP
