Proudly SA has demanded the Democratic Alliance (DA) issue a public apology for what it considers illegal use of its logo in a advert the party ran in weekend newspapers. The organisation which advocates for the buying of local goods, has today insisted that it is a non partisan, non political not for profit organisation and would never align itself with any political party. The DA ran an advert and posted material on twitter which features the Proudly SA logo alongside a message that ANC policy is “proudly made in Mumbai”. In our post-ANC SA, we will elect a govt that serves the ppl. Not their family, not their friends & not the Guptas#ANCNCP ↔️ Made in Dubai pic.twitter.com/QT0DYeaP8E — Democratic Alliance (@Our_DA) July 2, 2017 “This was a flagrant mis-use of a legally protected trade mark, incorporated into a political advert and designed to mislead the public into thinking that Proudly South African in some way endorses the Democratic Alliance’s stance and views, which is not the case and we cannot let this go lightly without distancing ourselves from this and any other political campaign,” said Proudly SA CEO, Eustace Mashimbye. Did you guys get permission to use the Proudly South Africa CI? Or did you just feel entitled to take it an use it? — LetlatsaLekhelebana (@lekhelebana1) July 2, 2017 What is going on here @Our_DA? What is our @ProudlySA logo doing on your poster?? Please explain!?
