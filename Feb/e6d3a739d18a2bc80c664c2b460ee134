Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp said Diego Costa is &#8220;not the nicest guy&#8221; on the pitch but praised him as an indispensable warrior for Premier League leaders Chelsea after the clubs drew 1-1 on Tuesday.Klopp was left furious with referee Mark Clattenburg&#8217;s decision not to award a free-kick for an apparent foul on Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren in the build-up to a late Chelsea penalty &#8211; which Costa missed.&#8220;If I had played against Costa, I could never be friends, that&#8217;s how it is, but when you have him in your team, it&#8217;s much more fun. He is a warrior,&#8221; Klopp told British media.&#8220;What (Antonio) Conte is doing with Chelsea is outstanding but Chelsea without Costa this season?&#8221;Costa, who won the penalty after tangling with defender Joel Matip, saw his low effort well saved by goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, which led to Klopp screaming in the fourth official&#8217;s face.&#8220;He (Costa) is not the nicest guy on the pitch but I saw no real big incident,&#8221; Klopp added. &#8220;If someone tells me it was a dive, maybe I will be angry tomorrow but that would be the wrong decision what, number 27, but it doesn&#8217;t make it better.&#8221;Despite the draw leaving Klopp&#8217;s charges in fourth, 10 points behind Chelsea after 23 games, Liverpool did avoid a fourth successive defeat at Anfield.&#8220;It&#8217;s not been easy but we have to keep going because we cannot change the past,&#8221; Matip said. &#8220;I think this was a good step to get some of this self-confidence back.&#8221;Liverpool travel to bottom-placed Hull City on Saturday.-Reuters
