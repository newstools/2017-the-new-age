There is a need for parents and society to protect every child from all forms of harm, including abuse, Gauteng MEC for health Gwen Ramokgopa said.The MEC was addressing an audience as part of the National Child Protection Week at the Nthabiseng-Thuthuzela Care Centre, Chris hani-Baragwanath Hospital, Soweto, Soweto, today. I m very concerned that crimes against children have reached epidemic proportions in our country and we seriously need to look at new and better ways of intercepting the cycle of this pandemonium, Ramokgopa said.The National Child Protection week is observed annually to raise highlight the rights of children as expressed in the Children s Act of 2005.Ramokgopa said most people who harm children are well known to them or close to their families, cautioning that parents and guardians should take responsibility to always be on the alert.She said the department had attended to at least 5700 cases of child sexual assaults this year. We have really made progress, but we should be ashamed that children are hurt by adults in the land of democracy where their rights are protected by the constitution and other related laws. Working with NGOs, sister departments and research institutions, we need to understand the profile of the abusers and be able to prevent the abuse, she said.-TNA Reporter
