Oil markets have already begun to rebalance after strong signs that producers are complying with output cuts, Kuwait Oil Minister Essam al-Marzouk said on Wednesday.&#8221;We are confident that rebalancing in the oil markets has already started,&#8221; Marzouk said.&#8220;We expect a positive impact on the market by the end of the first quarter of 2017,&#8221; he told a conference organised by Petroleum Intelligence.Marzouk said that signs indicate that OPEC and non-OPEC producers who agreed in December to reduce output by a total of 1.8 million barrels per day &#8220;are complying with their commitments to cut.&#8221;Marzouk heads a five-country committee tasked with monitoring the implementation of the landmark deal.The committee met in Vienna on Sunday and said that compliance with the six-month accord, which took effect on January 1, had been very encouraging.The aim is to reduce a global glut that has depressed oil prices and blown a huge hole in the public finances of producer nations, despite being good news for consumers.Marzouk said that compliance with the cuts &#8220;represents a guarantee for the price to recover to levels that encourage investments and ensure that crude stocks return to normal levels.&#8221;-AFP
