Months after her sister Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in Paris of nearly $10 million in jewels, supermodel Kendall Jenner has reported the theft of jewelry worth $200,000 from her Los Angeles home, celebrity website TMZ reported. Police told AFP that they had received a 911 call at about 1:15 am Thursday about a reported burglary in the area of Jenner’s home in the Hollywood Hills, but would not confirm that she was the victim. There are no suspects so far in the case. TMZ said the 21-year-old Jenner, one of the top runway models of the moment, was hosting a party and she left the house at about midnight. When she returned an hour later, she noticed her jewelry box was open and the jewels were gone. Earlier in the night, an alarm had sounded, warning that someone had opened a door, but Jenner did not check on it, TMZ reported, citing unnamed law enforcement sources. There was no sign of forced entry, leading investigators to believe the theft could be an inside job. Jenner is featured with her sisters on the reality television show “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.” Last October, Kim Kardashian was robbed of about $9.5 million in jewels while staying at a luxury residence in the French capital during Paris Fashion Week. Ten suspects have been charged in connection with that case. -AFP
