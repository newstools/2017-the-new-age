The Nelson Mandela Foundation&#8217;s Board of Trustees has called for President Jacob Zuma to listen to the people and step down.Addressing the media yesterday chairperson of the board Professor Njabulo Ndebele said Constitutionalism and the translating of South Africa s Constitutional rights into a lived reality for our people are fundamental to the legacy of Nelson Mandela.&#8220;It is clear that our country s constitutional democracy is under threat and its political process is in crisis,&#8221; said Ndebele.The institution reported that the recently published scholarly research has demonstrated the emergence of a shadow state which undermines fundamentally the integrity and the efficacy of the constitutional state and which thrives on secrecy.Ndebele said that they urge Zuma to listen to the voice of the people.&#8220;It is no wonder that this untenable situation has led to calls across the land for the Head of State, President Zuma, largely regarded as the author of the current malaise, to vacate the highest office of state.&#8221;Meanwhile the foundation is not the first institution to call for the President to step down, SACP General Secretary Blade Nzimande said the party s decision to call for President to step down is a decision that was not taken lightly.&#8220;Calling for the president to step down is not a decision we took lightly. It s not personal. It s a decision that in our view we thought would be correct,&#8221; said Nzimande.Ndebele urged South Africans to be vigilant against what can only be called a capturing of democracy itself.&#8220;We support the urgent establishment of a judicial commission of inquiry to expose state capture in all its forms. We must use the instruments of our constitutional democracy to remove leaders and their networks which are implementing such capture,&#8221; he said.TNA Reporter
