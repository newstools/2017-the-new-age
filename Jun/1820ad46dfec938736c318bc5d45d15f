Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane will attempt to once again host an imbizo on the 2017 Mining Charter after the first event experienced disruptions.The imbizo, which is part of the minister s programme to inform mining communities on the provisions of the newly unveiled 2017 Charter, will take place at the Aboo Tayob Community Hall, Mokopane, Limpopop.During the previous event, a rowdy audience prevented Zwane from addressing a meeting in Middleburg, Mpumalanga.The ANN7 channel footage released yesterday showed a group of people attending last week&#8217;s imbizo being offered R100 notes and food parcels.This has led to speculation that the disruption was orchestrated to prevent the minister from addressing the crowd.Zwane said the unruly behaviour would not deter him from addressing scheduled mining charter imbizos.The third iteration of the mining charter has stirred much contestation with various groups opposing and others welcoming it.The Chamber of Mines, representing the owners of 90% of SA s mines, have opposed the charter, arguing that they had not be consulted. They will approach the South Gauteng High Court to interdict the charter.In a statement, the chamber said: &#8220;Attempts to subvert those objectives by the unlawful publication of instruments that purport to give effect to such objectives but, in fact, undermine them .Zwane yesterday vowed to fight back saying those opposed to the charter opposed the government s transformation objectives.-TNA Reporter
