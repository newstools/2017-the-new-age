The African National Congress (ANC) Branch in Ward 29 in the North West province has on Tuesday certified that Brian Molefe is a legitimate member of the structure and supports his impending deployment to Parliament.Executive Mayor of the Madibeng Local Municipality Jostina Mothibe lashed out at what he called &#8220;a campaign of misinformation&#8221; against Brian Molefe&#8217;s membership.&#8220;We as the sub region we are in full support of what is happening currently&#8230;we support and we see Brian Molefe leading in undertaking his duty,&#8221; said Mothibe.Mothibe added that as a branch they were aware of individuals giving false information to the media.&#8220;Divisions and ill-discipline in the branch cannot be tolerated. We will not allow such behaviour in the name of our branch ward 29 undermining the culture of a constitutional structure,&#8221; said Mothibe.The branch produced Molefe&#8217;s membership form from 2011 which showed that he was a member.The ANC Women&#8217;s League in the province added that they were also behind Molefe&#8217;s deployment. &#8220;We support the appointment of Brian Molofe and we trust in the decision taken and we are in full support of it.&#8221;The ANC provincial leadership on Monday pledged its full support saying Molefe&#8217;s nomination is above board.Premier Supra Mahumapelo, who is also ANC provincial chairperson said everything about the nomination was above board. We have been in communication with the national executive committee (NEC) about Molefe s deployment. It s nothing new as discussions have been taking place for about eight months now, he said.Much speculation has followed Molefe s impending swearing in as an MP in Parliament with talk of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan being replaced by Molefe and a Cabinet reshuffle gaining momentum.TNA Reporter
