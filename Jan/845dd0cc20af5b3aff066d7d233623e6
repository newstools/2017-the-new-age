British cartoonist Posy Simmonds, widely regarded as one of the masters of the graphic novel, is working on a new book about a &#8220;fat, rich, greedy, stupid and criminal&#8221; member of the British upper middle classes, she told AFP.The author of the bestselling &#8220;Tamara Drew&#8221; and &#8220;Gemma Bovary&#8221; &#8212; both of which have been adapted into films &#8212; said her new female protagonist lives in London.But the story, which like much of her work gently sends up the British middle classes, is not proving easy.Not because of a lack of inspiration but because of the writer&#8217;s bad back.&#8220;Before, I used to draw very quickly because I worked for a lot of newspapers. I don&#8217;t want to labour it, but now I have such a bad back that I can only draw for 10 minutes at a time.&#8220;Then I have to get up and do something else before I can start again,&#8221; the 71-year-old added, saying the book was &#8220;well advanced&#8221;.Simmonds is president of the jury at this weekend&#8217;s Angouleme International Comics Festival in France, the third biggest in the world.&#8220;It&#8217;s a great honour,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know yet if they will put a crown on my head when I arrive in Angouleme on Thursday,&#8221; she joked.The jury she heads will decide its top prize, the Golden Wildcat, on Saturday.AFP
