Lameeza Trenose is a living legend.She hails from Broadlands Park in Strand, Cape Town.She is an HIV testing counsellor at the Masincedane Community Centre. On an ordinary working day, and with help from a community care worker, Trenose erects a tent in an identified area in a community and prepares to counsel and test community members on their HIV status.When the HIV tests and counselling gets complete, Trenose refers those with HIV-positive results to the community clinic for further clinical observations for treatment.Those with negative results she provides with informative cards on how to remain HIV negative and live healthy lifestyles. Trenose joined the centre in 2012. After resigning from her job as a salesperson at Mr Price, she began working as a community care worker at Gustrouw Clinic.There she counted HIV and TB medication for patients.Her position as a community care worker allowed her to interact frequently with HIV and TB patients. Somehow, her frequent interactions with patients made her realise that she wanted to continue serving the community in health care. She then moved to Masincedane to continue as a care worker. At Masincedane she was invited to attend a training programme to become an HIV testing counsellor for community members who were getting tested at the centre.For two months she attended and competed the training and began servicing the community as an HIV testing counsellor.In addition to HIV testing, Masincedane offers a variety of health care services to the Strand communities, including blood pressure and glucose monitoring, cholesterol monitoring, condom distribution, pregnancy test, family planning, foot care and eye testing.The centre also has sessions of and runs support group programmes for its users.The centre s community programmes are mainly funded by the lottery fund and the Western Cape government.Trenose is one of the key members at the centre involved in the HIV testing programme.Her community-based HIV testing tent provides easy access to the Masincedane HIV testing and counselling services.It makes it convenient for community members to spare a moment to check their HIV status while they are on the go for their daily errands.They no longer need to go to the communities day care clinics and wait in long queues before testing and knowing their status.Thanks in part to Trenose, the centre brings the HIV testing service close to their homes and for their convenience. Trenose says she enjoys being in the communities to provide the counselling and testing services as she saves community members lives. She adds that some community members do not feel the need to go to the clinics to test and know their HIV status.By being in their midst in the HIV testing tent and, as they walk by, some become encouraged and gain the strength to visit her for counselling and testing.In this way, Masincedane makes it easy for community members to know their status so that they can start their treatment early should they learn they are HIV positive. The epidemic of HIV-Aids has been a government and community challenge since the virus emerged in the early 1980s.However, a lack of knowledge about the virus made it difficult for the government and communities to deal with the early epidemic infections and deaths.As many South Africans were falling ill and dying, community members were astounded by the mysterious deadly illnesses that characterised HIV infected bodies.Family and community members did not know how to respond to the crisis.With the controversial non-response to the epidemic by the Thabo Mbeki administration, consequently leading to the Treatment Action Campaign court campaign to force the government to provide free medication to HIV positive citizens, non-government organisations were making it their business to service the community on HIV-Aids education and care programmes.Socially and clinically responsive campaigns were crafted to educate South Africans about the virus. Among the early responses to the epidemic was the LoveLife campaign which concentrated its sex education programs on the youth and communities.Thereafter, a number of social and clinical campaigns followed with HIV educational programs, each improving from the previous educational contents. Social and clinical research programs were conceptualised and conducted to provide updated content and information on the virus. The research findings necessitated upgrades on the previous educational contents distributed to the communities for the purpose of preventing and managing the HIV infections. Seemingly, they all worked on research trials but ongoing social and clinical basis.Statistics South Africa, Avert and UNAIDS reports that, as of 2015, there were 7 million South Africans living with HIV-Aids.By 2014, Avert reports that more than 3 million South Africans were receiving anti-retroviral treatment. With clinical and social research, the government and the non-governmental organisations have made strides in providing effective tools to prevent and manage the virus infections and related deaths.The reports show that from 2002 to 2016, there has been significant success in preventing and managing HIV-Aids in South Africa. Through the government sponsored anti-retroviral treatment (ART) and community programmes such as those offered by Masincedane, and the organisations that began the early community work with the rise of the epidemic infections and deaths, they report success in the fight against the virus.For Trenose, it is the ultimate achievement of saving and supporting lives that makes her enjoy the service of HIV testing and counselling communities at Masincedane.And it is her love for healthy communities that makes her a living legend who deserves to be celebrated and supported during this women s month and beyond.Her passion for healthy communities is welcomed.The Masincedane head office is in Strand with area offices in Khwezi and the Nomzamo Community Centre.Lameeza Trenose may be reached at the Nomzamo Community Centre office.Lindiswa Jan is a researcher and masters candidate at the department of social anthropology at the University of Cape Town
