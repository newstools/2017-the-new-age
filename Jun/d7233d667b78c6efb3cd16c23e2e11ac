This followed disruption and chaos by protesters who claimed that the rail security guards had been responsible for the shooting and killing of a 17-year-old boy during a service delivery protest march in Nancefield, Soweto, at the weekend.Metrorail has disputed claims that their protection services officers carry guns, and so their employees cannot be held responsible for the death of the 17-year-old boy. We do not give our own protection services officials guns. So, we will allow the police and investigators to help us to understand where that allegations are coming from, Mofokeng said.Metrorail train service between Johannesburg and Vereeniging have been suspended due to violent service delivery protests.Police spokesman Captain Kay Makhubele confirmed that they were investigating a case of murder.TNA Reporter &nbsp;
