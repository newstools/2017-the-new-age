The ANC council disruption would not stop the delivery of the State of the Capital Address (Soca) on Thursday, Executive Mayor of Tshwane spokesperson Samkelo Mgobozi said.This is after the ANC disrupted proceedings at the Tshwane Events Centre after they had proposed for the address to be postponed due to the 38th anniversary of the execution of struggle hero Solomon Mahlangu.&#8220;The ANC have completely undermined the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, the will of the people and the rule of law. This is symptomatic of an ANC in complete chaos as they continue to reach new lows.&#8221;The request was denied by council, which came to a decision that the Soca would continue as scheduled in honour of Solomon Mahlangu and the ideals he fought for to liberate people from the throes of poverty and destitution.Mgobozi said the ANC must remember that a decision of council is binding.&#8220;Members of the ANC responsible for this conduct will be dealt with appropriately pursuant to the rules of Council and the code of conduct of Councillors expressed in Schedule 1 of the Municipal Systems Act, he said.-TNA Reporter
