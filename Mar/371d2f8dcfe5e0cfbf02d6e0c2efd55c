The rap mogul Jay Z is partnering with the Weinstein Company to produce a feature film and documentary series about the killing of Trayvon Martin, the teen whose death in 2012 set off nationwide protests.They will make the film and six-part docu-series after winning a bidding war for the rights to two books about the killing of the unarmed black teenager by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, the trade magazine Variety reported on Thursday.The case ignited civil unrest across the country and a debate about racial profiling. It also gave birth to the Black Lives Matter movement.Zimmerman, who claimed he shot Martin in self-defense, was acquitted of a charge of second degree murder in 2013 by a jury in Florida.The film and series projects will be based on the books &#8220;Suspicion Nation: The Inside Story of the Trayvon Martin Injustice and Why We Continue to Repeat It&#8221; and &#8220;Rest in Power: The Enduring Life of Trayvon Martin,&#8221; Variety said.&#8220;Suspicion Nation&#8221; recounts the experience of a reporter who covered the trial for NBC. &#8220;Rest in Power&#8221; is by Martin&#8217;s parents.Another docu-series produced by Jay Z and Weinstein Television that touches on race relations &#8212; &#8220;Time: The Kalief Browder Story&#8221; &#8212; was aired last month.The six-part series follows the story of a teen arrested in 2010 while walking home for allegedly stealing a backpack. He spent three years in prison &#8212; two of them in solitary confinement &#8212; without a conviction.After the charges were dropped, he was released from New York&#8217;s Rikers Island prison and took his own life.-AFP
