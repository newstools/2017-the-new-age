President Jacob Zuma says Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng&#8217;s election to head the Conference of Constitutional Jurisdictions of Africa (CCJA) shows confidence and high regard for South Africa s judiciary on the continent.President Zuma congratulated Mogoeng who was elected on Wednesday to serve a two year term during the fourth CCJA congress hosted at the Cape Town International Convention Centre, under the theme: &#8220;Strengthening the independence of the judiciary and respect for the rule of law&#8221;. We wish to heartily congratulate the Chief Justice on his election and wish him all the best in his new responsibilities. This election to such a key continental position demonstrates confidence and high regard for South Africa s judiciary in the continent. &#8221;&#8221; This is a great honour for our country which happened on the eve of Freedom Day and just a few days before the beginning of Africa Month, said Zuma.The CCJA is an independent institution established by Constitutional Judiciaries in Africa to ensure that the Judiciary in each member state supports and deepens democracy by upholding constitutionalism and the rule of law.Mogoeng previously served as vice president of the CCJA under the outgoing President Marie Madeleine Mborantsuo of Gabon.Addressing the Conference Mogoeng called on Africans to rid the continent of corruption which he said was responsible for hindering Africa&#8217;s progress.&#8220;We enjoy a singular honour as judges of courts on this continent, of eradicating corruption, but we can only do that, if we are not corrupt. It takes the uncorrupted to deal effectively with those who are corrupt,&#8221;&#8220;Do we eat from the same dish as the corrupt, using our legal expertise to cover up?&#8221; said Mogoeng.-TNA Reporter
