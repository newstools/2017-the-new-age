As thousands of 2016 matric pupils receive their results today, the University of Johannesburg (UJ) has warned that it would not accept any walk in applicants.This is as some pupils queue at universities hoping to be enrolled after missing application deadlines a year before.A parent who was queuing with her child died outside the UJ campus five years ago during a stampede.UJ registrar Prof Kinta Burger congratulated all matriculants who have been successful in completing their final school examinations. We look forward to welcoming all who have been accepted for a programme of study at the university. The university reminds all who have applied to and are interested in studying at UJ that the application, admission and registration process is handled entirely online.This includes late application inquiries. UJ does not, under any circumstances, accept on campus late application enquiries (walk ins), Burger said.She said that for the 2017 intake, UJ has space for 10500 first-year students which would make UJ home to about 50000 students this year. All applicants who have been accepted for a programme of study at UJ will receive official confirmation of their final admission status via email by January 8. If applicants have not received an email by January 8, they should visit the UJ website to verify their final application status, or call the UJ call centre on 0115594555 for more information. Burger said all new UJ students accepted for a programme of study and who have registered and paid the first minimum payment online, may collect their student cards which would provide access to campus, libraries and other facilities. Inquiries related to late applications for programmes which may have additional capacity for enrolment, can be submitted online via the late inquiry link (MobiSite) on the UJ website from January 9, 2017. The university remains committed to its vital mission to empower our people, their families and the nation via the development and transfer of knowledge, insights and capabilities. Meanwhile, registration for 2017 has commenced at Unisa while Wits University is expected to reopen for registration on Monday.Batandwa Malingobatandwam@thenewage.co.za
