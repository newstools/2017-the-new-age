National First Division log leaders Thanda Royal Zulu have put a big not for sale tag on two players who have contributed immensely to the club s good fortune.PSL giants Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates are said have expressed interest in Thanda striker Mhlengi Cele and central defender Ayabulela Konqobe as they bid to fortify their squads for the PSL second round.Cele, a former Chippa United striker, caught the attention by scoring in almost every match in the first round, heading into the break with 12 goals. He is two goals shy of Sedwyn George from Royal Eagles who leads the scoring charts.His form saw Chiefs coach Steve Komphela and team manager Bobby Motaung head to Umlazi to monitor him closely when Thanda played AmaZulu in the KZN derby two months ago.And Konqobe s leadership at the back has attracted Pirates, whose technical team were spotted in the stands when Thanda beat Cape Town All Stars 2-1 last month at Umhlathuze Sport Complex.The former junior international, who was released by AmaZulu owing to ill discipline in the middle of the NFD campaign last season, has turned over a new leaf. He previously played for Ajax Cape Town and SuperSport United. Konqobe s a good player and has done well for himself since we got him here. I hope he remains focused to help us this season as we want to challenge for the title, Thanda coach Roger Sikhakhane said.Thanda CEO Jomo Biyela dismissed suggestions that his two key players are heading elsewhere. Nobody has approached us for the services of any of our players. Even if they come, we won t release them because we have set our sights on gaining automatic promotion, Biyela said.The KZN side have further indicated their promotion intentions by bringing on board striker Thabiso Nkoana from Stellenbosch FC on a six-month contract.LINDA XIMBA
