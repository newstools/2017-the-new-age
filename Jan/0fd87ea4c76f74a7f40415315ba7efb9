Twenty-eight students from needy families have received bursaries to begin their studies at tertiary institutions thanks to the Polokwane municipality and the bursary committee comprising external stakeholders.Polokwane mayor Thembi Nkadimeng said during a recent ceremony in honour of the beneficiaries: These 28 are very fortunate because more than 800 applications were received. We only wish that more funds were available so that we could take in a bigger number. Approximately R1.5m would be used for the 2017 bursary beneficiaries. The mayor thanked members of the bursary committee for their hard work in taking initiative to ensure young people reached a tertiary education. Special thanks to Standard Bank for their partnership. They are a major sponsor to the bursary fund. We also continuously use sporting activities like mayoral golf cup challenge, the Blue Bulls rugby team warm up games and other sporting activities to raise money for needy students. However it is not enough given the number of applications we receive, she said.Turning to the bursary beneficiaries, Nkadimeng said: You have to be grateful to the community of Polokwane for ensuring that they invest in your future and the best that you can do is to ensure that you never let them down. Focus greatly on your studies. The municipality conducted a feasibility study on how many of those who graduated could be absorbed into its system on a temporary basis or through learnership opportunity in order to complete the cycle of arming them with necessary skills for the job world.MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
