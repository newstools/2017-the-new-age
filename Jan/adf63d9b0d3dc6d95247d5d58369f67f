States can&#8217;t come and claim only been speaking foreign Intel since October 2016. Our clients can&#8217;t be detained indefinitely. We&#8217;re going to submit that rights of accused are being infringed,&#8221; Defence attorney said.But the state argued that they were not aware of the involvement of foreign countries involvements when it arrested the twins.Meanwhile, Magistrate Du Plessis refused to grant the pair bail saying that the court was dealing with an international matter and an international operations.Brandon-Lee Thulsie and his brother Toni-Lee were arrested in July 2015, when one of the family members tipped the police of the Twin s intentions to go and join the ISIS terrorist. The duo is believed to be linked to the notorious ISIS terror organisation.In June 2016 the United States and Britain warned of possibly imminent terrorist attacks by Islamic extremists in the country s major cities.South Africa, which has a Muslim minority of around 1.5 percent in a population of some 53 million, has so far escaped the jihadist attacks seen in several other African countries.-Sipho Jack
