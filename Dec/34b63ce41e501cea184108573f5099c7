The South African Police Service (Saps) in Sunnyside, Pretoria in partnership with the Jesus Restoration Mission Church yesterday reached out to over 150 homeless people to provide them with Christmas day lunch. According to the Police some of the staff who attended the initiative were already on leave, but however, made a sacrifice to give back to the community. Sunnyside police spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela led the Saps participation Christmas initiative. Mavimbela said that the police believe the initiative will provide an example of good leadership and encourage the homeless to stay away from criminal activities. The homeless who were in attendance expressed their joy and appreciation for the good gesture that was shown to them. “I am very happy for what the police and the church has done for us on this Christmas day, I hope all the others feel the same way,” A woman said. -TNA Reporter
