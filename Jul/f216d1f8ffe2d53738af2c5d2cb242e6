The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (HAWKS) has on Tuesday dismissed reports of links of involvement in the NPA offices burglary incident. The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (HAWKS) has learnt with utter shock concerning reports suggesting that one of its senior members was allegedly involved in the break-in at the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) offices on Monday,&#8221; the hawks said in a statement.The Hawks were responding to reports on some publications that named and linked a senior Hawks member to the NPA offices burglary incident in Pretoria.The Gauteng North Director of Public Prosecutions offices in Pretoria were broken into on Monday where Laptops were reported to be stolen.Eyewitness News reported on Tuesday (2017/07/11) that Brigadier Nyameka Xaba is suspected to have orchestrated the NPA incident after he was seen at their offices last week.According to their so called sources, one of the laptops that was stolen during the burglary belonged to a prosecutor who is handling Mr Vlok Symington matter. For the record, Brigadier Xaba who is currently on leave is not the investigator into the Symington matter and has never met the prosecutor handling the case.&#8220;Brigadier Xaba and his team members recently honoured an invitation from a prosecutor at the NPA offices to deliberate on an unrelated case as opposed to what eyewitness news has reported, said the Hawks.Hawks added that the report by EWN is baseless and such accusations should never have been given so much credence.Further more the statement calls upon EWN to retract the defamatory report which is entirely based on false allegations and deliberately intended to ridicule both the DPCI and Brigadier Xaba in the country.-TNA Reporter
