As South Africa improved marginally in perception of corruption levels, the public has been urged to continue being vigilant to defeat the scourge. Corruption Watch’s David Lewis made the call after the release of the 2016 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions index which found that the country recorded an improvement by moving from 44 in 2015 to 45 last year. The index looks at perceptions of corruption levels within the public sector in 176 countries on a scale of 0-100. “It’s the public that suffers the consequences, you look at services delivery protests. The public should continue being vigilant in the fight against corruption. It starts with civil societies, the media and everyone. Corruption is an underreported problem,” Lewis said. He said corruption remained a huge problem in SA even though quantifying the amount of money being lost through corruption was difficult. In the sub-Saharan African region, six nations did better than SA, with Botswana topping the African list for least corrupt nations, followed by Cape Verde. Lewis said while corruption was evident in a number of public institutions, intense public scrutiny was playing a critical role in fighting the scourge. “The answer is to be found in the intensity of public opposition to corruption. The outrage expressed by civil society organisations, ordinary members of the public and the independent media has galvanised a range of other individuals,” he said. Lewis said that the fact that SA was still ranked below 50 was concerning. Zodidi Mhlana
