The department has decided that all those who don&#8217;t return to work would be dismissed,&#8221; said Ramokgapa.The backlog between forensic pathologists and the department of health has seen families being turned away when coming to collect the bodies of their loved ones.Social activist Yusuf Abramjee said many religions demand that burials take place immediately. I just got calls from members of the Muslim community who are thinking of bringing an urgent high court application to force the MEC to release the bodies and to get the postmortems done. It might not affect court cases but it is causing trauma for families, he said.This as forensic pathologists, represented by Nehawu, say they refuse to conduct autopsies as they are not trained to do them.-TNA Reporter
