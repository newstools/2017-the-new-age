Arsenal players want Alexis Sanchez to stay at the club next season, defender Laurent Koscielny has said, as speculation continues to swirl about the Chilean international&#8217;s future.Sanchez has scored 28 goals in 49 appearances this season despite not being an out-and-out striker, but media reports have suggested he is unhappy at the club.The 28-year-old has a year left on his contract and has been linked with both Manchester United and City and several other leading clubs across Europe.&#8220;Firstly, he scored a lot of goals for us but his first job is not to be a striker, it is more midfield but he is an unbelievable player. He just wants to fight and have the best result for the club,&#8221; Koscielny told Sky Sports.&#8220;When you have a player like this in your team, to show the way we want to grow together, it is important and I think he has a lot of players behind him to keep him.&#8221;I don&#8217;t think there are a lot of players like him and a player like this who can be the difference during the game, it&#8217;s rare. We want to keep him with us because we know he is so important for our team.&#8221;Fifth-placed Arsenal trail Liverpool by a point and host Everton in their final Premier League match of the season on Sunday.
