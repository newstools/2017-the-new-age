The proposed sale of Thanda Royal Zulu s PSL status to AmaZulu could be finalised before the end of this week, say reliable sources. The latest development emerged after AmaZulu general manager Lunga Sokhela held a meeting with Thanda chairman Pierre Delvaux on Sunday.Sokhela had been overseas on business and is said to be the reason why the transaction had stalled. AmaZulu have tabled their documents to the PSL and the league s executive committee is said to rule on the matter before the end of this week. Delvaux has gone public about giving up his franchise, citing financial constraints as the reason. After the Thanda chairman went public about selling the club, the Umhlalthuze and Uthungulu municipalities, which backed the club while campaigning in the NFD, cried foul.The municipalities have forked out cash to renovate the Mhlathuze Sports Complex in anticipation of PSL games. They even wrote a letter to the PSL, asking it to block the move by the Thanda owner to sell the club. But it has since emerged that AmaZulu would meet the conditions set by the Thanda owner. One of those conditions is that the club must not relocate to another region.They also want its name to have Richards Bay in it. It s the scenario that is akin to Orlando Pirates, Golden Arrows and Cape Town City, who bear the names of their roots, the source said. This proposed sale, however, has created uneasiness among the players and technical staff, who are in the dark about their future.Contacted for comment, Usuthu spokesperson Brilliant Mkhathini said he did not have details of the meeting between Sokhela and Delvaux. Delvaux could not be reached for comment at the time of going to press.-LINDA XIMBA|news@thenewage.co.za
