As speaker of Parliament, Baleka Mbete is to decide whether to allow a secret ballot in a no-confidence debate in President Jacob Zuma but it is becoming clear that such an event is unlikely to take place this parliamentary session.The debate, whether by secret ballot or not, is likely only to be held in August.Last week Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng ruled that Mbete has the discretion to decree that a secret ballot be held.In the wake of that decision, DA leader Mmusi Maimane wrote to Mbete to request a motion of no-confidence debate be scheduled as soon as possible.Parliament spokesperson Moloto Mothapo yesterday confirmed that Mbete had received the DA request. She has a responsibility to ensure she thoroughly applies her mind before taking any decision. With the third term of Parliament ending on Friday, and the fourth one due to begin in the first week of August, it is unlikely that a no-confidence debate will be held this week.Another factor counting against a no- confidence debate being held this week is that the ANC policy conference begins in Gauteng on Friday.DENNIS CRUYWAGENdennisc@thenewage.co.za
