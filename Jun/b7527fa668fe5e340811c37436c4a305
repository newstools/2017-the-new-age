He warned delegates about bargaining of candidates between the provinces. It is the material conditions that determine the consciousness. Members have to be guided by the ANC document through the eye of a needle when considering leaders, Zuma said.The President said part of the discussions at the KwaZulu-Natal provincial general council should include how to deal with members wanting positions to further their material ambitions.President Zuma called for the through the eye of a needle to be read by all delegates.Despite the call not to discuss leadership, ANC Youth League Provincial Chairperson Kwazi Mshengu said young people in the province already know who they want to endorse. I am sure that during the course of this PGC we will get the opportunity to lobby ANC structures to agree that in the national conference, among other leaders that we ll elect, those leaders must be led by comrade Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, said Mshengu.Meanwhile, Treasure General Zweli Mkhize told delegates that political education needed to be deepened so that members who didn t grow up under apartheid aren&#8217;t easily swayed by the enemy.Mkhize emphasised on the importance of unity of the organisation.-Sipho Jack
