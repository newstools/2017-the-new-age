The University of the Western Cape (UWC) has denied claims by some activists that there was lack of accommodation at the institution.The claims were published in yesterday s edition of the The New Age.The edition also quoted University of Cape Town (UCT) vice-chancellor Max Price denying claims of the same issue at the institution saying about 70% of beds in residences were occupied by black students. The #RhodesMustFall lobby group says there s been white preference and I want to say that is completely wrong, Price said.This quote was in response to a story published during student protests last year.The university yesterday said it did not have any crisis relating to accommodation.UCT media liaison head Elijah Moholola yesterday said: The allegations of an accommodation crisis at the university is entirely incorrect. There is no accommodation crisis at UCT. All students who had not been placed in residences when the academic year started have now either been placed or have been assisted with finding off-campus accommodation. The institution allegedly facing an accommodation problem was UWC where the Central Housing Committee student body demanded that the university immediately address issues around student accommodation.About 30 students were occupying an administration block that was partially destroyed in student unrest last year.UWC spokesperson Luthando Tyhalibongo said student accommodation was a national issue. Tyhalibongo said currently demand outstripped supply. 701656
