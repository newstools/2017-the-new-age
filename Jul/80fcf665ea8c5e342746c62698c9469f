President Jacob Zuma said there were no losers or winners at the conference, and that the only winner was the African National Congress (ANC).Zuma said this in his closing remarks in Nasrec on the 6-day policy conference held under the theme Let us deepen unity .His statement was an attempt to try to save the ANC from tearing apart as the debate between the faction of former African Union chairperson Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma and current Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa was reaching a boiling point.In a surprising turn, Zuma urged delegates to have a second deputy president in making sure that they curb factionalism, adding that the National Executive should be made smaller.Important proposals have emerged for strengthening the National Executive Committee by making it smaller while at the same time strengthening the full time capacity at the Head Office.&#8220;There are options to be considered by the National Conference for more Deputy Secretaries General, an additional Deputy President and more directly elected full time NEC members to manage the day to day work of the organization in policy, political education, elections, organizing and communications,&#8221; Zuma said.-Sipho Jack
