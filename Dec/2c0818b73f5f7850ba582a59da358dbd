Business Leadership South African (BLSA) has congratulated Standard Bank Group for appointing the former Director of National Treasury, Lungisa Fuzile as the new CEO of Standard Bank SA. Fuzile departed the Treasury a few weeks before his contract was due to end. Communication Director of BLSA Themba Maseko said Fuzile’s departure represented a setback to the South African Civil Service. Maseko added that BLSA is excited by the retention of this critical skill within the South African financial services sector. One of the key pillars of BLSA’s contract with South Africa is black leadership empowerment and this appointment aided that. “We wish Fuzile the very best in his new roale,” Maseko said. -TNA Reporter
