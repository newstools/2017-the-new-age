PREMIER David Mabuza will celebrate his 57th birthday today by briefly vacating his office and bringing happiness to those in need.Mabuza has called on other people to consider helping the poor to eliminate the triple challenges of poverty, joblessness and inequality. He made the plea when he handed uniforms to more than 900 needy pupils at the Mdzimba Primary School in Mbombela yesterday.Mabuza s spokesperson, Zibonele Mncwango, said the premier was a former pupil at the school. Mncwango said Mabuza identified the school due to the number of impoverished pupils it had as he well understood that education was everyone s business.He said Mabuza would continue to better the lives of pupils in other schools since he once served as a school principal before his political career. The premier decided to visit the school where he was a pupil and donated uniforms to a large number of pupils, Mncwango said. Mabuza is confident that the uniforms will encourage the beneficiaries to look good like their schoolmates from better off families and be able to focus on their lessons without worrying about it. He said the premier further handed over a sponsored house to a widow, Eunice Mashego, in Mthunzini village outside Mbombela. The house was built by a contractor who was constructing a road in the area as part of his corporate social investment responsibility and decided that the shelter should be presented to the beneficiary by the premier.He said Mabuza made the donations ahead of his birthday celebration event scheduled to take place in Mbombela this evening. Mabuza will celebrate his birthday in style by having a gala dinner with business people and other stakeholders to raise funds for the DD Mabuza Foundation, Mncwango said.francen@thenewage.co.za
