As registration starts in most universities across the country, tertiary institutions have warned first-year students to be vigilant against fraudsters who might want to assist them with registration and accommodation.The University of Pretoria opened registration today and its spokesperson, Anna-Retha Bouwer, said the institution had become aware of certain organisations and individuals planning to offer students assistance with the registration process. We urge you to be careful to deal only with university staff, as only staff members are authorised to assist you with fees, housing, registration and any other administrative support.This will help you to avoid any negative consequences. Please be aware that no political party or organisation has been given permission to provide assistance to students, she said.Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (NMMU) has also issued a warning after two students were robbed by fraudsters who offered them bogus accommodation.Last week, a first-year student was duped into applying for fake accommodation via the internet.The 18-year-old saw an advertisement on a well-known internet site, contacted the person and paid a deposit of R3500 into the person s account to secure the accommodation.When the student wanted to view the place, it was discovered that the address supplied did not exist and the person who offered the accommodation was nowhere to be seen. Students are advised to be cautious, particularly at the start of an academic year when fraudsters actively exploit newcomers to the metro and university, NMMU s Atheema Davis said. NMMU is aware of at least two students who have been duped as a result of bogus accommodation offers in Summerstrand and is assisting police with their investigations. Davis urged students not to forward money or financial details until they had seen the property or verified the offer.Batandwa Malingobatandwam@thenewage.co.za
