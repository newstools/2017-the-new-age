The Eastern Cape department of health cannot be blamed for patients who default on their treatment, spokesperson for the health department Sizwe Khuphelo said today.This follows the pupil&#8217;s death few hours after visiting a local clinic in Port Elizabeth. It is reported that an 18-year-old Yonela Nqokoto died on the back of a bakkie while on her way to the Booysen Park clinic. Nqokotho was said to have been refused treatment.However, Khuphelo disputed the claim, arguing that it was not true that she Nqokoto had been turned away from the clinic.&#8220;We are not taking responsibility for Nqokotho&#8217;s death. The patient went to the clinic. All protocol were followed,test conducted and service test were required and then the patient absconded, he said.He added : &#8220;What do you do when patient leaves the clinic .We cannot take responsibility. Patients and community members have a duty to go to the clinic for a service,&#8221; Khuphelo said.Nqokotho visited the clinic for the second time yesterday suffering from chest problem.Her mother Ntombizodwa Nqokoto said she was examined by the nurses, but not given medication before being sent home after health officials claimed she had absconded from the clinic.&#8220;If someone decide to abscond we trace that patient and send our community health professionals to assist, but we cannot be blamed for someone who decide to default,&#8221; Khuphelo said.Four days earlier, a 20-year-old-Siyabonga Jim died after being turned away from Lunga Kobese clinic, also in the Nelson Mandela Bay.Jim, a TB patient, was a student at Kwazakhele High school. He was allegedly told at the clinic he could not be helped.&#8220;The patient was not a candidate of primary health facility given the fact that he died shortly afterwards. However, if the nurses were on duty the nurse would have asses the patient and called emergency to take the patient to the next level of care,&#8221;Khupelo said.&#8220;We are are investigating the allegation that all nurses were not on duty at the time of the incident,&#8221; he said.In another incident, Sandiswa Thunyiswa gave birth to her baby boy yesterday. She was allegedly sent home by a nurse at the Booysen Park clinic who insisted &#8220;she was not in labour&#8221;.This is the same clinic that have reported allegedly turned away Nqokoto. Thunyiswa allegedly gave birth to her son on the pavement.TNA Reporter
