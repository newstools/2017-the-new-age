Orlando Pirates will be looking to redeem themselves and win back the confidence of their supporters when they face-off against Kaizer Chiefs in the Soweto derby at FNB stadium on Saturday.Newly appointed Pirates coach Kjell Jonevret said his team will be looking for win.&#8221;This is the first Derby for me but I don&#8217;t know anything about going for a draw, we are going there to win,&#8221; Jonevret said.Jonevret has only been at the helm for Pirates for less than 30 days. He was roped in to rescue the mighty Buccaneers after a long stretch of no victory. They will be hoping to get back to their winning ways and possibly win some trophies this season.Pirates managed to avoid another disappointing match as they played to a 1-1 draw on coach Jonevret&#8217;s first match on the bench against Polokwane City in Orlando Stadium.Meanwhile Kaizer Chiefs will go into this derby more confident than the wounded Buccaneers as they will hope to advance their derby stats lead.The Naturena side will be going into this derby confident as they are unbeaten in the 2017 calendar year. Coach Steve Komphela will be leading Amakhosi into his sixth Soweto derby this weekend.Having seated on the bench for more than 20 months as the team&#8217;s coach, Komphela will be hoping for a regulation time victory. His first charge at the side was a baptism of fire as the Buccaneers went away with a win. Their last derby meeting ended in a draw with neither of the sides getting bragging rights.However Coach Komphela believes that his team is ready for the derby and has been studying coach Jonevret.&#8221;I have checked on him (Jonevret), he shouldn&#8217;t sit here thinking we don&#8217;t know anything about him,&#8221; Komphela said.For supporters going into the match, authorities have arranged several transport options with Rea vaya, Metro rail, KTK shuttles and Top 6 Taxis will be shuttling supporters to and from the stadium.The public has also been warned against buying fake tickets. Kaizer Chiefs marketing manager said tickets are moving fast.Tickets for the highly anticipated derby went on sale in the beginning of last month.The derby between the two arch-rivals Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs will kick off on Saturday at 3:30pm and Gates will open at 11:30am .-TNA Reporter
