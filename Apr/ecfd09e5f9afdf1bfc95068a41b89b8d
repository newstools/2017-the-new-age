A set of criminal charges will be laid against Executives and management of CitiBank and 17 other banks for their role in the collusion and rand manipulation scandal. Black Empowerment Foundation (BEF) civil society organisation is set to lay charges at Point Police Station in Durban KwaZulu-Natal on Thursday. BEF says it intends to open a criminal case against the banks for “corruption and collusive actions in the Forex Manipulation scandal” revealed by the Competition Commission earlier this year. “According to our mandate and constitution, we are obliged to institute action with regards to issues that are in the interests of the unmasking and exposing of corporate ulterior motives as well as educating broader society with regards to the economy and the effects of corruption,” said BEF in a statement. A press conference detailing the charges brought is expected to take place later on Thursday. In February the Competition Commission announced that it had evidence of collusion and price fixing among major banks. The banks included Absa, Barclays Capital, Barclays Bank plc, Standard Bank, Standard New York Securities, Investec, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas, JP Morgan Chase, JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Credit Suisse, Commerzbank, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, Nomura International and Macquarie Bank. The matter was then referred to the Competition Tribunal for prosecution. Citibank later announced that it would pay an administrative penalty of over R69 million for its role in the collusion and price fixing. Citibank alongside Absa and Barclays have been providing evidence to the Competition Commission regarding the collusion of 17 banks to manipulate the rand. -TNA Reporter
