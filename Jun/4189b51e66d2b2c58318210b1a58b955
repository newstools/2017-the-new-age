SABC board interim chairperson Khanyisile Kweyama says charges have been formulated for a second disciplinary inquiry against Hlaudi Motsoeneng. This time the charge is related to the public protector&#8217;s report.In 2015, a probe by former public protector Thuli Madonsela found Motsoeneng had acted fraudulently when he, among others, lied about a matric certificate he did not have on his CV.This comes at the back of Kweyama&#8217;s confirmation of Motsoeneng&#8217;s dismissal as an employee of the public broadcaster. The disciplinary committee yesterday found the former chief operating officer guilty on all charges including disrespecting and undermining the newly elected SABC board.She clarified that Motsoeneng&#8217;s dismissal was not immediate, but rather he had been issued a one-month notice period to accommodate the second disciplinary committee.Commenting on Motsoeneng&#8217;s axing, Communications Minister Ayanda Dlodlo described the process as fair, confirming that his position would be filled in the course of the next two months.Dlodlo added that she had not yet ruled out seconding someone from another entity to &#8220;hold the fort&#8221; at the broadcaster.The SABC today also announced that it would conclude the 2016/17 financial year with a loss of R1.1bn.The SABC has indicated that it is currently holding discussions with the communications department and national Treasury to raise funding.&#8221; You cannot expect the same management which presided over the mess at the SABC to get a Treasury guarantee to salvage finances,&#8221; Dlodlo said.Meanwhile, Kwanyama announced that suspended chief financial officer (CFO) James Aguma&#8217;s disciplinary hearing will sit on Thursday.-TNA reporter
