Truworths International Limited announced that their headline earnings a share for the period are expected to decrease between 2% and 6%, to between 380.6c and 397.9c a share, compared to the prior period HEPS of 403.8 cents a share.The group said that they experienced a challenging trading environment during the 26-week period ended December 25, 2016, in a trading update last week. Factors contributing to the tough environment included low economic growth, high product inflation resulting from rand weakness, reduced foreign revenues when translated into rands arising from sterling weakness, and the negative impact of the credit affordability assessment regulations in SA.This impact is reflected in the marked decrease in active accounts and credit sales relating to those customers who have been less than 12 months on the group s debtors book. Truworths had a 21% increase in group retail sales to R10.2bn while cash sales grew by 53% and credit sales remained unchanged.Credit sales comprised 50% of group retail sales for the period. The debtors book increased to R6.4bn and was 5% higher than at the prior period-end.The percentage of active account holders able to purchase at the end of the period was at 85% and 82% at June 2016.-Thelma Ngoma|thelman@thenewage.co.za
