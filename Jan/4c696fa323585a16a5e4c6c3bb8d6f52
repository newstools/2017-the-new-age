South African Airways (SAA) has warned citizens on a hoax survey doing rounds on social media for free tickets to travel anywhere.&#8220;SAA is neither conducting an online survey nor offering free flight tickets. We have no association whatsoever with this so-called survey.&#8220;Free flight tickets are a luxury we cannot afford at this stage as the airline is focusing on restoring financial stability and is managing its costs to improve its performance, SAA Spokesperson Tlali Tlali said.According to the airline company, the scam is an open invitation to interested parties, inviting participants to tell 10 friends on WhatsApp about the survey. Participants are requested to answer four survey-type questions and the steps include distributing or sharing the survey with ten friends,&#8221; said Tlali.Tlali has strongly urged everybody to exercise restraint than to be brave and sorry. Furthermore, to ignore this hoax survey and to avoid clicking on the link if they receive it.Last year, two scams came on the surface where it stated that customers have been selected to participate in a short survey and get two South African Airways tickets for free, with customers directed to a link.Furthermore, the second one was targeting SAA customers requesting personal information from them.-TNA Reporter
