There does not seem to be much that the Springboks are willing to borrow from their disastrous campaign in 2016 when they take on France in the first Test on Saturday at Loftus Versfeld. Even forwards coach Johan van Graan was at pains trying to figure out just what worked and the truth is not much went right for Allister Coetzee s team last year.Three camps in 2017 and a match in three days time, there seems to be renewed vigour from a team that looked to be ready to die last year. To prove that none of the people in the Bok camp are serious about leaving 2016 where no one can never find it, Van Graan urged everyone to look into the future. It has been fantastic to have three camps. We have a clear plan and clear objectives. The past is in the past. Right now we are looking to the future.We will take what we can out of 2016. We have done our research. Part of their planning has seen the Boks come up with a forwards pack that knows what Test rugby is about, while also trying to maximise on what the Boks have been known for in the mauls, line-outs and general set pieces in the match. This will mean a lot will be expected out of players such as Tendai Mtawarira, Lood de Jager, Steven Kitshoff, Eben Etzebeth, Siya Kolisi and captain Warren Whiteley.-MMASEKEPE MATSEBANE|mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
