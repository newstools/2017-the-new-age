Brazil&#8217;s jobless rate shot to 13.2 percent over the last quarter, the state statistics office said Friday in a blow to the center-right government&#8217;s promise of economic recovery.The rate for December through February jumped from 12.6 percent in the previous quarter, which had been a third higher than the unemployment figures a year earlier.This amounts to 13.5 million people out of work, the Brazilian Geography and Statistics Institute (IBGE) said. That&#8217;s 1.4 million more than in the previous quarter and 3.4 million more than in the same period a year earlier.The unemployment rate has dented the popularity of the market-friendly government of President Michel Temer, who took over last year after the impeachment of president Dilma Rousseff with promises to restore the economy to health.Brazil&#8217;s economy shrank 3.8 percent in 2015 and is expected to have contracted a further 3.5 percent in 2016, the most painful recession in a century.However, the government and central bank forecast a modest return to growth in 2017. This will be boosted, Temer says, by far-reaching reforms intended to cut the deficit, reduce longterm spending and force fiscal responsibility.-AFP
