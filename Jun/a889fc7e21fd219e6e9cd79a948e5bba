THE smoke caused by 10 000 burning tyres should not give residents of Sunderland, west of Pretoria, sleepless nights as it posed no direct harm to them, Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga said today in a statement.The tyres, which broke into fire at the weekend, were stored by a private entity in an open veld. They are for practice purposes at a rifle shooting range.The fire broke out on Saturday, and has been allowed to burn out on its own as trying to extinguish it through the use of water would have unintended consequence of polluting the environment.Msimanga said the fire had been brought under control, allaying health hazard fears by the residents. Community members can expect to see thick black smoke. However, they need not panic as it poses no direct harm, Msimanga said.The city of Tshwane emergency personnel has been on sight to ensure that the fire did not spread.Msimanga praised the emergency personnel for containing the blaze, as a result helping to avoid injury or fatality. The team demonstrated its preparedness in responding immediately following the incident. This is the type of calibre of employees we have, willing to protect our residents and the environment, he said. They proactively anticipated potential threats and mitigate them by using available resources in innovative ways,&#8221; Msimanga said.However, according to experts, burning tyres can pose a number of health risks with the smoke generated known to emit many toxic materials and gases.Environmental organisation Environmental Law Alliance Worldwide, said carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs), are some of the toxins present in fires caused by tyres.The city s environment and agriculture management team will monitor the impact of the air pollution.-TNA Reporter
