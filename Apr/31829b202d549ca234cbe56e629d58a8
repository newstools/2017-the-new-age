Ten-year British government bond yields rose slightly.&#8220;I have just chaired a meeting of the cabinet where we agreed that the government should call a General Election to be held on the 8th of June,&#8221; May said in a surprise statement outside her Downing Street office.&#8220;It was with reluctance that I decided the country needs this election, but it is with strong conviction that I say it is necessary to secure the strong and stable leadership the country needs to see us through Brexit and beyond.&#8221;She said she would introduce legislation on Wednesday to pave the way for the early election. Under current legislation, the next election was not scheduled to take place until 2020.May&#8217;s Conservatives, who were split on the issue of European Union membership ahead of last year&#8217;s referendum, are currently far ahead of Labour, the main opposition party, according to opinion polls.&nbsp;Reuters
