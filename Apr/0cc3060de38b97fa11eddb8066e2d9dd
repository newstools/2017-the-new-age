Mamelodi Sundowns continue with their winning ways in the Absa Premiership following their 2-0 win over Ajax Cape Town on Tuesday night at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium.The home side struggled to play their normal football in the early stages of the game. Ajax controlled the game but could not penetrate Sundowns defence. The Urban Warriors came close to scoring an opening goal in the 37th minute but Grant Margeman headed the ball straight at Denis Onyango.Things changed completely in the second half as the home side was all over Ajax. Sundowns broke the deadlock in the 67th minute when Percy Tau clipped the ball over the goalkeeper. The Brazilians doubled their lead six minute laterwhen Anthony Laffor passed Zwane the ball in the box who simply tapped it into an empty net.This win sees Sundowns move to the 2nd spot on the table with 47 points from 23 games. The African Champions are two points behind the log leaders Cape Town City who defeated Kaizer Chiefs 3-2 on Tuesday at the Cape Town Stadium.However, the league seems to be in control of Pitso Mosimane s team that has two games in hands and if they win Friday s match against Golden Arrows they will top the table.Bidvest Wits lost 1-0 to SuperSport United at the Bidvest Stadium. Wits are still contesting for the title despite losing a crucial match to United at home.
