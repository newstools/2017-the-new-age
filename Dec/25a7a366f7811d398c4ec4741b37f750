Judge Kgomo’s appointment was announced in October by Police Minister Fikile Mbalula as the new watchdog for the Directorate Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI). According to reports, during the announcement Mbalula said Kgomo will be filling the vacancy following the passing of the former Hawks judge. Head of Corporate Communications and Liaison Brigadier Novela Potelwa said the judge has just finished an internal tour where he and his team introduced themselves to DPCI staff and outlined their office’s mandate. -TNA Reporter
