Many families still find adoption taboo, especially black people, who rather prefer quietly taking care of the offspring of a deceased relative.This gesture is done as part of the ubuntu adage, where the deceased s child is taken care of by the family to avoid an orphanage. This practise has been done over the years and legal adoption has been omitted as a result.Adoption is a a permanent and safe way of caring for an orphan child in the field of child care and protection. For many years it has been regarded as the most effective means of providing permanent and stable family life for children.Our country is faced with the challenge of an increasing number of orphaned children, abandoned babies, neglect and exploitation of children.Due to this alternative care programmes like Child and Youth Care Centres and foster care are overburdened by high numbers of children. This may be attributed to the high levels of poverty, unemployment, unwanted teenage pregnancy, family disintegration, HIV-Aids or the death of parents or guardian.According to the department of social development, the long-term benefit of adoption is not maximally utilised compared to other forms of alternative care. This can be attributed to, among other factors, insufficient popularisation and marketing of adoption in South Africa and the lack of incentives for adoptive parents. The adoption policy framework and strategy identified lack of adoption knowledge as one of the barriers to adoption.The shortage of prospective adoptive parents is attributed to lack of awareness and education within communities about adoption services as well as the cultural barriers and service providers obstacles such as insufficient capacity in terms of specialised skills and human resources to provide adoption services.The department hosted a community adoption dialogue in Winterveldt, Pretoria, which seeks to create a platform where parents can speak and share their experiences while encouraging other to adopt formally.For those parents who have adopted, they can also apply for a child support grant and the benefit is one s contribution to society. One of the speakers, 23-year-old Kgomotso Mgiba, from Winterveldt, in 2012, broke the stigma and gave her 11-month-old daughter up for adoption because she was still studying at the time and she wanted the child to grow up in a stable family background.She said she did not have any regrets after she gave her daughter away for adoption, instead she is happy that her child is taken care of, even though the child was adopted in a foreign country, Denmark, as the family keeps in constant contact with her and she is given updates on the development of the child and are sending her pictures of her daughter, who turns five this year.Mgwenya Kekana, an adoptive parent of three, said she was grateful for having adopted three lovely children.As a result she took to the podium and encouraged other parents, especially blacks, to do away with old myths and ease the burden on children s homes. It can however demonstrate that more awareness programmes and dialogues are required so that people can be encouraged to save vulnerable lives that end up growing without formal family background in orphanages, which deny children the constitutional right which states that: Every child in SA has a right to family or appropriate alternative care. According to the Gauteng city region (GCR) accelerated social transformation Strategy 2030, the strategy defines a child as, a child who enjoys all the rights in terms of an adequate standard of living, recognising the child s right to physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development . The GCR recognises that parents of the child have the primary responsibility to secure this right within their abilities, while the statemust take appropriate steps to assist parents and others responsible for children. The GCR will provide for these rights, including educational, health, psychosocial and material assistance, nutrition, clothing and housing, in the case where parents may not have the means to provide. The dangers of children who are not in proper care are at risk of being abused, exploited, live on the streets, trafficking or living on their own in poverty. It is for this reason that awareness campaigns are viewed as one of the strategies to increase the number of adoptions in South Africa.Sipho NcubeSipho Ncube is from the Gauteng department of social development
