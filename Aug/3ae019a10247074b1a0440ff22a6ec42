ANC Free State chairperson Ace Magashule has accused some in the party s national structure of working with the EFF and DA.He said he had proof of his allegations and would reveal this in the future.Magashule took a harsh stance on Friday by saying ANC members of Parliament (MPs) who voted against President Jacob Zuma should resign voluntarily.Speaking at the ANC assembly in Parys, Magashule said it is logical for those MPs to willingly hand in their resignations. It makes sense when the party has given you a particular direction and you take another route. What do you expect? You want us to expel you. Why don t you voluntarily resign?, Magashule said.On Tuesday, Zuma survived his eighth motion of no confidence, which was held via a secret ballot in Parliament.Following a two-hour debate, 198 MPs voted against the DA s bid to remove Zuma, while 177 voted in favour of the motion.About 30 ANC MPs voted for Zuma to be removed. A majority of 201 votes was needed to unseat Zuma as president. Magashule said the MPs who went against the party s instructions were now forcing the ANC to remove them.In relation to the accusations, Magashule said: We have ample evidence that some are actually working with the DA, I m talking nationally, to dislodge the ANC out of power. He appealed to those MPs who had voted against the party to come to their senses, focus and never sell out the revolution .The ANC in the Free State was scheduled to meet at the weekend, however, divisions within the provincial party structures resulted in a postponement.The party is hosting its cadres assembly instead to resolve its internal issues.Zuma, as well as presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, are expected to attend the assembly.&#8211;REFILWE MAGASHULE
