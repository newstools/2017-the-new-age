Despite the disinvestment of General Motors South Africa (GM) at the end of the year, other automotive industry players say they still see greener pastures as the Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa said it would invest further and create more jobs.GM said last month it would be leaving South Africa at the end of this year, citing poor investment returns. Ford has invested more than R125m to upgrade the 3 000m vehicle conveyor system at its Silverton assembly plant in Pretoria, in order to increase its production capacity for the locally built Ford Ranger and Everest. This is despite its setback of recalling more than 400 Ford Kugas at the beginning of the year due to faulty cooling systems.The company yesterday said the investment formed part of its manufacturing expansion plans to increase the plant s capacity by 22% from 27 jobs per hour to 33 jobs per hour by January, following the move to a two-vehicle facility last year, when the Everest joined the Ranger on the Pretoria assembly line.The new conveyor system, which began operating earlier this year, optimises the plant s automated electro monorail system webb conveyor between the body shop and the paint shop, thereby improving overall production efficiency by reducing stoppages. This means fewer delays in production and an increase in the number of vehicles manufactured for the South African market, as well as for export to 148 markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Andreas Bruditz, area manager for the body shop, said the new system improved the structural capability of the system by significantly reducing and, in some cases, eliminating interruptions between the two production areas. The new conveyor is based on similar systems employed at our assembly plants in Europe, using proven technology to maximise production efficiency and capacity, Bruditz said.Meanwhile, Ford s Ranger continued to dominate new vehicle sales in May, earning its third month as South Africa s top-selling model and claiming leadership on the sales charts. A total of 2 875 Rangers were sold in May, giving Ford leadership of both the overall market and the light commercial vehicle segment. The Ranger was also one of the country s top exports for the month, with 4 432 vehicles destined for customers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.However, Neale Hill, Ford s director of marketing, said despite their investment expansion plan, the reality was that the South African economy was clearly under pressure, which was reflected in the reduced levels of purchasing activity in the new vehicle industry.-SELLO RABOTHATA|sellor@thenewage.co.za
