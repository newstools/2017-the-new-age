IN THE aftermath of the ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa’s victory, business boomed for informal traders selling merchandise outside Nasrec in Johannesburg. Vendors got to interact and do business with the new ANC president during his first walkabout at Nasrec yesterday afternoon. Ramaphosa was accompanied by Keith Khoza, director general of human settlements in Gauteng and the newlyelected treasurer-general of the ANC, Paul Mashatile. Ramaphosa also made a stop at a stall selling CDs and documentaries on the ANC, much to the delight of owner Bonisis Hanana. Meanwhile, bolstered by their candidates’ success, supporters appeared to be in a generous mood opening up their wallets to snap up the goodies on offer. Olga Hlengane from Meadowlands, Soweto took advantage of the cold weather by selling fashionable ANC branded coats in addition to the warm beverages like tea, kota and some soul food. “Business really picked up on Tuesday (yesterday) after Ramaphosa was announced as victorious, many people hung about outside the venue and they supported my business to a point that the food sold out,” Hlengane said. Precious Ndlovu showed The New Age team the new stock she bought after her old stock was sold out yesterday afternoon. “The support on Saturday was slow but Tuesday and today business was booming, this stock arrived this morning,” Ndlovu said. Another vendor who did brisk business was Rebecca Brown who sells unique umbrella hats which she says she stocked in China. “Around 2013 during Nelson Mandela’s funeral, an umbrella caught my eye, the seller told me where she had bought it. I also went to China, I am the only one who is selling these in South Africa,” Brown said. -NTOMBI NKOSI AND KUTULLO MADISHA|ntombin@thenewage.co.za
