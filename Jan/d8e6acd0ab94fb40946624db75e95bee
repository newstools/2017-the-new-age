The titanic legal battle between Oakbay Investments and Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan may have far-reaching consequences for the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) and its head Murray Michell.Last year, Gordhan approached the North Gauteng High Court for a declaratory order seeking to prevent Oakbay Investments from pressurising the finance minister to intervene in a decision by the country s four major banks to close the banking facilities of the company.A certificate issued by Michell was at the centre of Gordhan s application. According to the certificate, Michell listed 72 transactions amounting to more than R6bn that had been flagged as suspicious.The attachment of the certificate to Gordhan s application triggered a national media frenzy with former shareholders of Oakbay accused of money laundering.The company asserts in its affidavit the FIC s provision of the certificate in support of Gordhan s application was unlawful.Acting Oakbay CEO Ronica Ragavan said: The certificate is entirely irrelevant to the issues in the declatory application and ought to be struck out. I demonstrate that the acquisition of the certificate was improper and unlawful and that the certificate holds no evidential value. Ragavan said Oakbay hired the services of international investigations firm Nardello &amp; Co to review the 72 transactions listed in the FIC certificate.According to Oakbay, the conclusions arrived by Nardello raised serious question marks over Michell s motives in providing the certificate to Gordhan in support of his application.In its report, Nardello concluded there was not enough information about the 72 suspicious transaction to identify them in the books and records of Oakbay Group or the personal bank accounts of members of the Gupta family.It further asserts that two-thirds of the allegedly suspicious transactions occurred after the time when the banks had already decided to terminate their relationship with Oakbay.Regarding the 72 suspicious transaction reports , Oakbay said the company made every attempt and pursued every avenue open to it, to gain the information it needs to prove that each and every transaction is legitimate and above board .In a further attempt to obtain information related the 72 suspicious transactions, Oakbay also launched an application against the FIC in the high court.Despite providing the certificate in support of Gordhan s application, the FIC failed to report its suspicions to the law enforcement agencies.An annexure to the Oakbay affidavit by the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, also known as the Hawks, confirmed it did not receive any complaints from either the FIC or the banks. This office wishes to confirm that there are no reports or complaints relating to this matter that were received from the banks or the FIC as cited in your correspondence, Hawks head Berning Ntlemeza said.The matter is set down for argument on March 27 in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria. 701198-TNA Reporter
