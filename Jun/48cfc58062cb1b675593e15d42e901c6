SOUTH Africa s controversial snake pastor Penuel Mnguni has admitted to Nigerian pastor Prophet TB Joshua that it was wrong and unscriptural of him to have made his congregants eat snakes, grass, weaves and rats in the name of the Lord.Social media platforms were abuzz, after Mnguni asked for deliverance at the Church Of All Nations service, in Lagos, Nigeria, which was aired yesterday afternoon on DStv s channel 390.Mnguni told the congregation that he had read certain scriptures such as Mark 16:17-18 which led him to believe he could feed his congregates strange items to prove the power of God.However, he admitted that after discovering Emmanuel TV and listening to Prophet TB Joshua s teachings, he had realised his activities were not scriptural . I am commonly known as the snake pastor due to the demonstration that took place in my ministry, I gave live snakes to congregates to eat and told them the snakes wouldn t harm them, Mnguni said.He said after this went viral through media he was stalked. I was attacked and followed, even by the government.They arrested me due to the things I did. I came to realise that what I was doing was not written in the Bible, he said. After confessing, Mnguni requested prayers from Prophet TB Joshua for deliverance from the spirit that pushed him to engage in such bizarre, inhumane actions.Facebook user Thabo Moloi said: I thank the Lord for this bold step by pastor Mnguni. Another, Sifiso Sibeko said all fake prophets should go to hell.Pastor Joshua, who has a worldwide following, was thrust into the limelight after his church building in Lagos collapsed, killing more than 80 South Africans as well as scores of Nigerians in 2014.ntombin@thenewage.co.zaNTOMBI NKOSI
