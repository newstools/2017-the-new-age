French fashion house Chanel has triggered an uproar by selling a luxury monogrammed boomerang with a price tag of nearly US$1,500, with critics saying the accessory is an insult to Australian Aborigines.Chanel is accused of turning the hunting weapon, an important part of Aboriginal heritage, into a status symbol by offering a black wood and resin boomerang for sale in its spring-summer collection.&#8220;When I think about Aboriginal culture, I think @chanel,&#8221; Aboriginal activist Nayuka Gorrie tweeted sarcastically.&#8220;Have decided to save for the next three years so I can connect with my culture via @CHANEL.&#8221;He told the Guardian Australia that the item was &#8220;so wrong it is almost absurd&#8221;.&#8220;Having a luxury brand swoop in, appropriate, sell our technologies and profit from our cultures for an absurd amount of money is ridiculous and hurtful,&#8221; he said, pointing out that indigenous people were the most disadvantaged in Australia and had to fight to preserve their traditions.The furore kicked off when American make-up artist Jeffree Star posted photos online of the boomerang on Tuesday, sparking ridicule.&#8220;@JeffreeStar, rather than paying $2000AUD for a Chanel Boomerang you should look into investing in one made by an Aboriginal Australian,&#8221; tweeted user LSP.Another said on Twitter: &#8220;@CHANEL your &#8216;boomerang&#8217; is tacky and a gross appropriation of indigenous culture for your own profit.&#8221;Chanel released a statement saying it was &#8220;extremely committed to respecting all cultures, and regrets that some may have felt offended&#8221;.Boomerangs have played an important role in Aboriginal culture for thousands of years as objects of work and leisure. They have also become popular mass-produced souvenirs.-AFP
