Billions of rands is flowing out of South Africa illegally every month, national director of public prosecutions Shaun Abrahams disclosed in Parliament.Abrahams also informed the Justice and Correctional Services Portfolio Committee that the Hawks were still investigating Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan in connection with the so-called rogue unit of the South African Revenue Service. The reality is that the matter is not before me. The matter is under investigation by police. The investigation by the South African Police Service priority crimes investigative unit, the Hawks, is still ongoing, Abrahams said yesterday.He said he would only make a decision once the matter has been finalised.Serious consideration, he said, must be given to the creation of a counter money laundering advisory committee as envisaged in the early 2000s.Last August, he said as a direct result of the almost uncontrollable increase in illicit flows and the modus operandi associated with some government departments and stakeholders grew convinced of the need to create such a committee.Action and cooperation is absolutely necessary to curb the ever increasing scourge of illicit flows because billions of rands leave this country on a monthly basis , he said.Abrahams could not give the portfolio committee details of individuals the NPA was monitoring because that would alert individuals being investigated.Abrahams confirmed to the committee that deputy national director of public prosecutions Nomgcobo Jiba and Lawrence Mrwebi were put on special leave at their own request following their lodging of an appeal against a court decision that they be struck off the roll of advocates.He said he had given this information to the DA s lawyers who had approached him about the two. He had also told the DA lawyers the circumstances and terms applicable to the leave. One of these conditions was that if he required the duo to come into office for any work-related reasons, he could ask them to do so. They have not returned to office except for one day. Abrahams was also asked about racist comments made by, among others, Western Cape Premier Helen Zille.He declined to be drawn into the matter, but said: As the NPA we are in a position and will be in a position to prosecute matters in relation to the Hate Crimes Bill when it comes into law. Abrahams was asked about the resignation of advocate Gerrie Nel to join Afriforum and launch a unit, which would initiate private prosecutions.South African courts have consistently held that only individuals and not institutions could apply for a certificate to prosecute.He said there has only been one successful application where private prosecution has been sought and that is a murder matter here in the Western Cape .Asked about the usage of African languages in courts by the chairperson of the portfolio committee, Mathole Motshekga, Abrahams said he supported this especially in cases where all the parties spoke same language. The only challenge is when there s appeals and those records need to be transcribed or interpreted. DENNIS CRUYWAGENdennisc@thenewage.co.za
