Zinedine Zidane&#8217;s fears that Real Madrid&#8217;s lack of intensity at the start of games would eventually cost his team have proved well founded.On Wednesday night, away against a Valencia side that has endured its worst season in many years, Real showed a defensive frailty that allowed their opponents to score twice in the opening nine minutes on their way to a 2-1 upset of the La Liga leaders.&#8220;That was our fault, &#8221; Real vice-captain Marcelo told the club website. &#8220;We started very poorly and there can be no excuses for it.&#8220;We did all we could to at least have got a draw, but we conceded two daft goals and we must learn from our mistakes.&#8221;Just when it seemed Real might establish a stranglehold on the leadership, they find themselves still only one point ahead of defending champions Barcelona and now with just one game in hand.&#8220;We still remain top but we have to change things, we can&#8217;t be starting games like that,&#8221; Marcelo said.Worrying for coach Zidane is that his side, which had set a Spanish record 40-game unbeaten run in all competitions before falling 2-1 at Sevilla on Jan. 15, has now lost twice in six league games. Their last five away games have produced just one win in La Liga.It was a missed chance to pile more pressure on a Barca team that has been on the ropes in the last week following a 4-0 humiliation at Paris Saint Germain in the Champions League.Barca coach Luis Enrique and some of the players were booed on Sunday when they needed a 90th-minute Lionel Messi penalty to win 2-1 at home over strugglers Leganes.&#8220;It hurts because it was a key opportunity to have extended our advantage at the top,&#8221; Real captain Sergio Ramos told the club website. &#8220;But we&#8217;ve got to move on and think about our next game.&#8220;La Liga season is a very long one.&#8221;-Reuters
