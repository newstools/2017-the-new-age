We start this piece, for a good reason, by making reference to a biblical passage taken from the book of the prophet Isaiah 2.4 in which it is written: He will judge between the nations and will settle disputes for many peoples. They will beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nations will not take swords against nations, nor will they train for war any more. The passage is a reflection of what life looked like in the ancient world with the threat of war and conflict and exile. The prophet envisions an ideal world in which disputes are settled and where nations will not take swords against nations, nor will they train for war any more .Some 105 years ago in 1912, the ANC was born with a vision in which coexistence was an ideal to be pursued. But that ideal meant that a framework for coexistence would have to be created for all the people of the country and not just for a privileged society.In the words of the ancient writer, the land envisioned by the forbearers of the ANC at its inception on January 8, 1912 would be the land in which universal peace would be the fruit of practising justice This makes sense if we consider that in the beginning, when the ANC was formed, the project in part was in response to the many defeats the African people had suffered at the hands of colonialists culminating in the defeat of the Zulus in the Bambata rebellion of 1906 in which the African people were revolting against British imperialism and unjust tax laws imposed on them.It was at that stage in 1911 when Pixley ka Isaka Seme saw it fit to make a clarion call to all Africans to bury the hatchet of hatred and jealousy and to commit to establishing a national organisation under which the Africans would express their idea of social justice and common goal. He said: We are one people. These divisions, these jealousies, are the cause of all our woes today. These words were said in 1911. They were out of the realisation that the many wars of resistance waged by the African people in response to the land dispossession and all forms of subjugation had come nothing, resulting in defeat after defeat.He argued that if Africans failed to pool their resources and work together, nothing would come of their efforts for self-determination. A year later his words were heeded. The ANC was formed as a national resistance movement to pit its strength against the common enemy which was injustice, dispossession, colonialism and imperialism.In Bloemfontein, on January 8, 1912, at some little church a potpourri of Africans from all walks of life, languages, tribes and professions gathered to form a movement that was to be known as the South African Native National Congress. The movement later became known as the African National Congress (ANC).The mission of the broad movement, as envisioned by Pixley ka Isaka Seme, was to liberate the African people as a whole and not along tribal lines, a practice that had been prevalent in African politics, a focus on narrow interests such as ethnicity or tribal affiliations. In his own words, Seme would reiterate: We are one people. These divisions, these jealousies are the cause of all our woes today. With that in mind, in a little church, representatives from all sections of the country s African population gathered with one thing in mind and only one thing, which was to use their collective numbers to dismantle the forces that oppressed them.The church leaders would assume the role of leadership, giving content to the nascent movement on how to proceed into the future, guided by the values of social justice and the desire to achieve the common good. The reverend Dr John Langalibalale (Mafukuzela) Dube was to be the founder of the ANC and would be given a mandate to strengthen the newly formed movement, working in unity with others.Like the ancient prophet, Dube would work tirelessly towards welding together African people of different origins to work for the common good of all, never again, in a manner of speaking, to train for war , but rather work together to seek social and political and economic justice for his people, who had been marginalised by the oppressive decisions of African subjugation taken by the decision makers at the formation of the Union of South Africa two years earlier in 1910.This single-mindedness of purpose of unity would become pervasive and a norm for the ANC as it committed itself to be a truly broad church , accommodating and forming alliances with like-minded formations whether they be communists, socialists, nationalists, without regard to skin colour, ethnicity and religion, among others, but committing to be the leader of a people who sought to be unshackled from the bondage of oppression.This approach, with a series of modifications along the road to political emancipation of April 27, 1994, led to a strong and vibrant ANC.The Nelson Mandela era of negotiation with the enemy camp informed by pragmatism, was to win the day for all South Africans and also liberate the oppressors and to give new light and vision of justice to oppressors such as FW de Klerk, the last president of the apartheid South Africa, to release political prisoners and to have the exiles return home to make a meaningful contribution to the creation of a new country out of the ashes of apartheid rule.The armed struggle in which the military wing of the ANC, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) played a vital role in the liberation trajectory, had served its cause and so had the massive internal resistance by various pressure organisations, including the South African Council of Churches and others.But the glorious days of the vibrant ANC appear to be coming to an end. The movement is becoming its own enemy. The recent events of serious skirmishes and disagreements have seen KwaZulu-Natal becoming the killing fields, with many losing theit lives because of political expediency.There may be some within the organisation, as former president Thabo Mbeki alluded some years ago, who may perceive the organisation as a cash cow of some sort and so come to it with the intention of advancing their political ambition of careerism. This is not what the movement was created for. It was created to be the leader and bring about justice in the country.Secretary-general Gwede Mantashe has often predicted that the ANC would self-correct . This even as the movement continues to stray, veering away from its stated mission of being the leader of society.The war-talk language among some of its members has become prevalent and many comrades have claimed to have had their lives threatened. We have seen the so-called youngish MK veterans in army fatigues use violent language, making allusion to settling political scores violently.Self-correction must also mean that we all need to heed the words of the ancient prophet: Nations will not take swords against nations, nor will they train for war any more. In the words of Madiba, may the exulted and the wretched of the earth live as equals.JO-MANGALISO MDHLELAJo-Mangaliso Mdhlela is a writer, commentator and head of the TNA/ANN7 cadet journalism school
