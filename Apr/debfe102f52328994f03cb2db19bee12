The Beverage Association of South Africa (BevSA) has welcomed changes to the proposed Sugar Sweetened Beverages tax outlined in the budget speech, but maintains its concern about the negative economic impact, limited health gains and inadequate baseline studies in a submission to national Treasury on the matter.The Draft Rates and Monetary Amounts and Amendment Bill tabled in Parliament by the former minister of finance Pravin Gordhan in February incorporates a tax on sugary beverages and represents the first indication of how national Treasury s proposed health promotion levy may manifest in law.While acknowledging and agreeing with the World Health Organisation s targets on sugar consumption and supporting initiatives to reduce total sugar intake in a sustainable way, BevSA said it remained concerned there had been disproportionate focus on sugar in beverages as a source of calories. The proposed levy will have no discernible impact on obesity, only reducing the average daily intake of South Africans by just 3-4 calories per day. The levy targets just 3% of the average South African s daily caloric intake, BevSA said. BevSA executive director Mapule Ncanywa said Nedlac and the parliamentary processes now in motion offered an opportunity for all interested parties to engage and develop an effective anti-obesity solution that will not lead to job losses while still meeting health objectives. Ncanywa said: We look forward to working with the government, unions and civil society to finding a solution to the serious and complex challenge of obesity that makes sense for all South Africans, while continuing to make an important economic contribution to the South African economy. -Thelma Ngoma|thelman@thenewage.co.za
