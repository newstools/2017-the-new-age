Sibanye Gold s Cooke mine in Randfontein, 30km southwest of Johannesburg, will remain shut until at least Thursday as the company goes through an appeals process for workers fired for participating in a wildcat strike, it said yesterday.The company was expected to continue with business as usual yesterday but Sibanye s spokesperson, James Wellsted, said there was a very low turnout and the company continues to receive reports and possible threats to the safety of their employees who might wish to return to work. We want to make sure the environment is safe for our employees, he said.Wellsted said the appeals process for the dismissed employees will take place this week and the mine has decided to maintain the suspension on the operations until Thursday when it will review the situation. The miners have to give reasons why they believe they should be re-employed.Workers at the mine downed tools almost two weeks ago, angered by a company drive to root out illegal miners, which included the arrest of employees for collusion, the sacking of 1 500 workers and lost gold production of 15kg a day.In the meantime, dual-listed Sibanye has reached a wage agreement with the International Union for its recently acquired American platinum and palladium producer Stillwater Mining Company operations.In terms of the agreement, there will be a 2% general wage increase for all job categories, effective from June 2 to January 1 next year. From January 1 to June 1, next year, a 1% increase will be effective. A further 2% annual increase will be in effect for the second year of agreement, from June 2 to June 1, 2019.Stillwater is based in Colorado and has two underground mines and a metallurgical plant in Montana.NONHLANHLA MASEKObusiness@thenewage.co.za
