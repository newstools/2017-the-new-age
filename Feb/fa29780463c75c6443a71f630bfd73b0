THE triumphant 2007 SA Rugby World Cup team is bouncing back after 10 years and this time they plan to unite through charity events to plough back support to communities.They aim to ignite the same euphoria from 2007 when they travel around the country on their charity-driven mission.Following discussions to spark A 10 Years On Campaign, the idea was conceptualised to recall the RWC win and all it symbolised at that time.The campaign will see the winning captain John Smit and his 2007 team assemble at several key events planned throughout 2017 to raise awareness for appointed charities supported by the rugby fraternity and the celebrate reunions between the players.Smit said: This is a great opportunity for the group of 2007 to reunite after 10 years, enjoy each other s company, while raising some much-needed funds for charities in South Africa. Our group feels it received so much from the game and South Africa and if we could give back in any way through the events planned in 2017, we would view it as a thank you to the game and this country for the support it gave us during our time. The South African Rugby Legends Association (SARLA) and Old School Group announced that the first of the campaign will be launched at the upcoming Zando Cape Town 10s today and tomorrow.The VIP Invitation Team, sponsored by Sharp, will host some of the finest and most respected rugby players. Sarla CEO Stefan Terblanche, said: It is indeed a wonderful privilege to be part of this group and to relive some of the Rugby World Cup 2007 magic in France even though I wasn t part of the Rugby World Cup-winning team. Rugby means so much to South Africans and to share a weekend with some of these special players is something most supporters dream of. VINCENT CRUYWAGEN
