The DA says it is unhappy with KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Sibongiseni Dhlomo’s announcement that his department will investigate an alleged suicide, as with any “unusual death”. A 25-year-old man, who cannot be identified due to the sensitivity of the case, allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself in the toilets at Addington Hospital. His body was found three days later. The DA’s Dr Imraan Keeka said it was not nearly enough for the MEC to say the death would be investigated, as they do with all “unusual deaths”. “The MEC is right, this is an unusual death, however, we believe it is more than unusual,” Keeka said. Keeka said this just showed how out of touch the MEC was. He said negligence charges should also be laid against those responsible for the man’s disappearance. “There are those who are tasked with looking after the patients. Why didn’t they notice that there was something amiss?” Keeka said he had written the chairperson of the parliamentary portfolio committee on health, to conduct an investigation. He said that at the moment, the DA wanted to console the family during their bereavement and would assist the family in whichever way they could. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Thembeka Mbele said the investigations are continuing. -TNA Reporter
