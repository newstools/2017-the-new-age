The Democratic Alliance (DA) must either remove Helen Zille or forget about running the metros in which the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) are coalition partners with the party, EFF president Julius Malema said today.The EFF entered into coalition with the DA to run at least three metros in the country which include Johannesburg, Tshwane and the Nelson Mandela Bay. If the Da allows Zille to be the Zuma of the DA they will undermine efforts to remove the ANC come 2019, Malema said at a media conference he addressed at the party s Braamfontein headquarters in Johannesburg. We will not be aligned with a party that supports colonialism as Zille is. If that is the case, we will not vote with them DA), Malema said.He said the DA should demand the same thing of its members as they do of other parties, alluding to the DA s desire to remove President Jacob Zuma as its leader.Malema s utterance comes amid the decision by the DA to suspend former leader and Western Cape Premier Hellen Zille from all party activities but let her stay on as the premier. He argued what the DA wished to do was untenable.On the issue of coalition, the EFF leader warned the DA to stop what he called white arrogance . If the DA doesn t stop this white arrogance members of this group might leave, he emphasised, also cautioning that if they DA continued with the same mentality , it would not succeed in its bid to dislodge ANC from power in 2019.At the same time, Malema defended DA s leader Mmusi Maimane, saying that his party (EFF) would defend him, referring to the way he was disrespected by the DA s federal council chair James Selfe, when he reversed his decision to suspend Zille.&#8220;Mmusi is my brother and we will defend you from the EFF&#8217;s side, Malema reiterated.However, he said if Zille was not dismissed, the EFF was five minutes away from voting with DA in all the municipalities they were running .-Sipho Jack
