THE horribly decapitated body of a three-month-old baby found dumped outside a hostel shocked the Thokoza community yesterday morning.The body, which is yet to be identified, was discovered by a 27-year-old woman between the Madala and Khuthuza hostels in Khumalo Street. Police spokesperson Capt Buyisile Mvelase said the lower part of the infant s body was found next to the gate and the baby s head found inside a yard. Police received a call from a 27-yearold woman in the morning before 8am and proceeded to the scene. While the lower part of the body was next to the gate, the head was found in the yard between the two hostels, Mvelase said.By yesterday evening, no one had come forward to claim the body of the baby and no arrests had been made. An autopsy will be conducted together with a DNA test. The infant s remains were taken to the government mortuary in Germiston for further investigation and to determine the child s gender.A hostel dweller expressed shock at the gruesome killing. I could not even look at the sight. Such cruelty cannot be put into words, he said.South Africa has high levels of violence against children with those under the age of five more likely to suffer abuse and be killed in their homes.Research from the University of Cape Town said one in three children become victims of sexual violence and physical abuse before reaching the age of 18.Mvelase said three police dogs had been deployed to the scene of the crime in a bid to speed up the investigation. At this stage we don t have any information of a missing baby being reported but we are pleading with community members to come forward if they have any information or to phone,&#8221;-TNA Reporter
