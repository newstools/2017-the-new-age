A well-known artist Zwelethu Mthethwa was today sentenced to 18 years for the murder of the 23-year-old sex worker Nokuphila Kumalo at the Western Cape High Court.Sex workers came in great numbers to witness the sentencing of the famous artist, Mthethwa.Handing down the sentence, judge Patricia Goliath said the killing of sex workers would not be tolerated. The famous status of the accused does not afford him a special favour. The accused lacked the appreciation of the seriousness of the case by not explaining himself, Goliath said, adding that given the high rate of femicide, harsher sentencing needs to be given as a deterrent against these crimes .Initially Mthethwa had pleaded not guilty to kicking to death Khumalo in Woodstock on April 14, 2013.Goliath deviated from the minimum sentence of 15 years, handing down a longer sentence of 18 years.Handing down the sentence, Goliath said: The deceased was a sex worker and that meant her vulnerability was high.In June 2015, the court proceeded with a trial-within-a-trial to determine the authenticity of the footage and whether it could be admitted as evidence. The state had alleged that a CCTV footage captured the artist stopping his black Porsche 911 Carrera close to Khumalo in the early hours of the morning.It further alleged that the footage showed the accused exiting his vehicle and repeatedly kicking her and stamping on her body with booted feet . She died as a result of blunt-force trauma, the court said.Mthethwa&#8217;s sentencing was postponed in April after his lawyer William Booth argued that his client wished to sort out his personal life which included informing his 15-year-old daughter in England of his conviction and sentencing, also sorting out her tertiary education.The lawyer argued that water and electricity accounts at his R5m home in Devil s Peak Estate had to be taken care of, along with his Porsche, furniture, and art collection.Mthethwa is a painter and photographer and recently made headlines after Iziko Museum appointed him to join their organisation.TNA Reporter
