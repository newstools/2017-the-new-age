While the 237 youngsters he allegedly scammed out of thousands of rands are accommodated by the Salvation Army, a former South African National Defence Force (SANDF) employee known as General Ndaba will remain in the Kgoshi Mapuru prison as police conduct further investigations against him.Ndaba also faces more charges on top of fraud and corruption he has already been charged with.He appeared in the Pretoria North Magistrate s Court yesterday where the case was postponed for further investigation.Police spokesperson Mathew Nkoadi said there have been new allegations brought against Ndaba. The man will remain in custody for the next seven days as further investigations are being done. We have also received new allegations against him, Nkoadi from the Akasia police said.Ndaba was arrested by the Akasia police on Tuesday after the Gauteng department of social development rescued the young people, whom he allegedly duped into paying large sums of money for training and enlisting in the SANDF.The victims, most of whom are under the age of 30, were recruited mostly from KZN. They reportedly paid R300 for their registration and R1800 for training as well as R200 per month since last year for lodging.They claim to have been trained as military war veterans under Amabutho Royal Defence to be integrated into the SANDF. They were taken to the Salvation Army in Akasia for accommodation last night and will be repatriated to their homes today. The SANDF strongly condemns activities aimed at deliberately misleading the public regarding recruitment into the SANDF, spokesperson Col Ronald Maseko said.He urged the public to report activities or any people who solicit money from them with the promise of securing employment in the SANDF to the nearest police station or SANDF base. SANDF reiterates that there is no integration into the SANDF following parliament s promulgation of the Termination of Integration Intake Act of 2001 and the Demobilisation Amendment Act of 2001 that formally and legally brought the integration process to an end on December 31, 2002.
