Security police in apartheid-era South Africa were a law unto themselves who had no regard for the rule of law or justice, the South Gauteng High Court heard yesterday.Testifying in the inquest into the death of anti-apartheid activist Ahmed Timol, human rights lawyer George Bizos said security police behaved as though they had authority over everyone. They actually decided which magistrate would take which case. Unfortunately, there were prosecutors, there were senior prosecutors that did the bidding of the security police. There was nothing that we could do about it, he said.During his submission, Bizos said in a number of the inquests in the past, magistrates used evidence that was presented crookedly by prosecutors.In the Timol case, a document purported to have been drafted by the South African Communist Party instructing its members to commit suicide rather than betray their comrades was used. This was despite being told by the prosecutor that he would not use it in court. We thought that the document would at least be shelved. We believed that there would be sufficient humanity to tear it up or put it away not to be handed over to the magistrate behind our backs, Bizos said. And what sort of a magistrate was it who takes into his consideration of giving judgment on a document that was not placed before him? Bizos said there was a significant portion of evidence that Timol s co-accused Saleem Essop, who had already testified, was not aware of.Essop earlier this week gave an account of how he was tortured by the police while in detention to a point of near death .Bizos said at one point, Essop was found comatose on the 10th floor passageway some four days after Timol s death.According to Bizos, there were people in the administration of justice who did not do what was expected of them.He said there were those who thought that their so-called patriotism to the apartheid system was more important than justice.The veteran lawyer was part of the legal team that represented Timol s family during the first inquest in 1972, after which the magistrate ruled Timol s death as suicide and that no one could be held responsible.Timol died in 1971 while in police custody after being arrested with long-time friend and comrade Dr Salim Essop.According to the police s version of what happened, Timol had jumped out of the 10th floor window of John Vorster Square, now called the Johannesburg Central police station.They claimed his jumping was unprovoked as the atmosphere in the room at the time had been the most relaxed imaginable .Although there were three different versions of what happened in Room 1026, where Timol is said to have jumped, the magistrate ruled that the discrepancies were only due to a misunderstanding between the police officers.LILLIAN SELAPISAlillians@thenewage.co.za
