This was in addition to the 31 complaints that were filed with the NCC early last month.Montano said that the complaints were not limited to the recalled Ford Kuga 1.6 model which had been catching alight. There have been other incidences with Ford Kuga 1.5, 1.6 and other models, but the company does not want to take any responsibility, he said.Hattingh said that a team handling Ford Kuga related complaints had been set up. We have dedicated manpower to this particular matter. We have assessed other complaints that we received previously, he said.Ford Kuga 1.6 vehicle owner Jimmy, 33, died when his car burst into flames between George and Knysna on December 4, 2015.Jimmy s family has been very vocal about his death, challenging Ford to take responsibility for it.His family announced that it will be pursuing a civil claim against Ford South Africa over Jimmy s death. Other Ford Kuga owners will be part of the class action.Jimmy s family said that they want the company to take responsibility for his death.

The company said the cars should be taken to dealers as soon as possible.More than 4 500 Kugas have been affected by the recall. The company said that more than 4000 courtesy vehicles had been handed over to vehicle owners whose cars had been recalled.However, some affected vehicle owners have spoken about struggles to receive courtesy cars.
