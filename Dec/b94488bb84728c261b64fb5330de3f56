The Road Traffic Management Corporation has condemned the incident of a motorist assaulting a traffic police officer. “We condemn the incident, it is absolutely unacceptable for anybody to attack law enforcement officers in the manner that was displayed in a video that emerged,” RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane said. This comes after a video of a traffic police officer and a motorist emerged on social media while they had an altercation. In the video, the traffic officer seems to have requested that the motorist give him his physical address for him to issue a traffic fine. The driver refused to furnish the officer with the information. The driver’s accomplice then tells the officer that the driver does not have a physical address. A physical tussle happens between the two as the driver forcefully attempts to take his driver’s license from the traffic officer. The driver then pushes and shoves the officer around and slaps him. “I will bleksem you, I will cut off your balls,” the driver says to the officer, then goes on to swear and make threats. Zwane said that the motorist has since been arrested and appeared in court on Monday.  “In fact, he should have been arrested on the scene.” The video was posted by someone on facebook who said in the post that the traffic officer stopped the driver allegedly for overtaking on barrier line. Zwane has called on the motorist to respect the law and treat officers with respect. -TNA Reporter
