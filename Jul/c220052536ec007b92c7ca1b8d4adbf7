Emotionally it doesn&#8217;t affect me. I remain a professional broadcaster. South Africa needs to know what happens with their public broadcaster.&#8220;I have been there for 10 years and I have never been suspended. New people come in and suddenly there are problems with 15 days. You&#8217;ve got someone who used to design costumes on set who is now telling presenters what to do?Marawa promises to expose some individuals in the SABC, People will soon know who these people are and what they do. They go for soft targets. These are trumped-up charges borne of people who have scandals of their own and are afraid to expose themselves, Marawa told TshisaLIVE.The presenter has been with the SABC for over a decade. He has been off-Air for the past weeks during these feuds with his employers.His producer, Beverly Maphangwa, was suspended last month and soon after Marawa demanded her reinstatement, he made it public that he would not continue with the show without her.-TNA Reporter
