Centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-right leader Marine Le Pen have emerged as winners of the first round presidential vote in France.The result clears the way for a straight two-way fight between the pair in a run-off on May 7, with opinion polls flagging Macron as favourite.Here are some of the international reactions to Sunday&#8217;s vote:&#8211; European Union &#8211;European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker congratulated the pro-EU Macron and wished him &#8220;good luck&#8221; in the run-off, Juncker&#8217;s spokesman tweeted.&#8220;To see the flags of #France and the EU greet the result of @emmanuelmacron, it&#8217;s the hope and future of our generation,&#8221; tweeted EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini.Michel Barnier, the European Commission&#8217;s chief negotiator on Britain&#8217;s withdrawal from the EU, hinted at concerns Le Pen could lead France away from the bloc.&#8220;Patriot and European, I will put my trust in Emmanuel Macron on May 7. France must remain European,&#8221; the Frenchman tweeted.&#8211; Russia &#8211;Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia &#8220;respects&#8221; the result, and is &#8220;in favour of building good and mutually beneficial relations&#8221;.Russia has appeared as a keen backer of Le Pen, who met President Vladimir Putin in a surprise visit to Moscow ahead of the vote.&#8211; Germany &#8211;Chancellor Angela Merkel&#8217;s spokesman wished Macron &#8220;all the best for the next two weeks&#8221;.&#8220;It&#8217;s good that Emmanuel Macron was successful with his course for a strong EU and social market economy,&#8221; Steffen Seibert said in a tweet.Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel expressed confidence that the 39-year-old would be France&#8217;s next president.&#8220;I&#8217;m sure he will sweep away the far-right, rightwing populism and the anti-Europeans in the second round,&#8221; Social Democrat Gabriel said in a video posted on Twitter during a trip to Amman.Writing on Twitter, he added: &#8220;I&#8217;m glad that @EmmanuelMacron is leading the field. He was the only truly pro-European candidate.&#8221;&#8211; Austria &#8211;The head of the Austrian far-right FPOe, Heinz-Christian Strache, congratulated Le Pen on her &#8220;historic success&#8221;.&#8220;Europe&#8217;s patriotic spring can celebrate another success and step forward&#8230; The old established parties and their discredited representatives will gradually disappear into insignificance all across Europe. They have been ruining Europe for years!&#8221; he said on Facebook.Strache said that because &#8220;established French parties&#8221; were backing Macron, it would be a &#8220;wonder&#8221; if Le Pen won the second round.&#8220;But the system, like in Austria, is on the brink. It is just a question of time. More and more citizens have had enough of the system politicians responsible for the current disaster.&#8221;&#8211; Britain &#8211;Former Conservative finance minister George Osborne, recently appointed editor of London&#8217;s Evening Standard newspaper, hailed a good result for the centre.&#8220;Congratulations to my friend @EmmanuelMacron. Proof you can win from the centre. At last, the chance for the leadership that France needs,&#8221; he tweeted.&#8211; Denmark &#8211;Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen expressed cautious optimism that former banker Macron would emerge victorious over Le Pen.&#8220;Congratulations @EmmanuelMacron. We should await the final election, but Europe needs an openminded and reform oriented France =&gt; Good luck!&#8221;&#8211; Norway &#8211;Norwegian Foreign Minister Borge Brende, whose country is not a member of the European Union, tweeted: &#8220;We need more not less cooperation in #Europe.&#8221;&#8211; The Netherlands &#8211;Geert Wilders, Dutch MP and leader of the anti-Islam anti-immigrant Freedom Party, swung behind Le Pen, welcoming the result as a &#8220;bright day for patriots in France and elsewhere who want more national sovereignty and less EU and immigration.&#8220;I have just sent her my sincere congratulations. Now on the way to a vigorous second round, I am hoping for a President Le Pen.&#8221;-AFP
