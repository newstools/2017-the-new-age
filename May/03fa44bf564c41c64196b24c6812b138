Police have increased deployments in all areas of Gauteng to deal with business and house robberies and the hijacking of vehicles.They have urged the public to contact the police if there are any suspicious people and vehicles lurking in their areas. This is after three robberies in just one day on Tuesday.Two suspects who robbed a couple in Kempton Park will appear in court today facing charges of armed robbery and possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition.The suspects were arrested on Tuesday after they had followed a man and his wife from their business to a bank in Kempton Park.Gauteng police spokesperson Col Lungelo Dlamini said the couple were confronted by the suspects, who held them up at gunpoint and demanded the cash which they were carrying to the bank. As the suspects were fleeing from the crime at the Festival Mall, they were confronted by the mall security guards and arrested. All the money was recovered. As the police were continuing with investigations, a possible get-away vehicle was recovered in the parking lot, Dlamini said.He said during the arrest, the firearm was recovered and will be sent for ballistic examination for further investigation.He said more investigations were continuing as the suspects may be linked to other serious and violent crimes including business robberies, house robberies and hijacking of vehicles.Police in Gauteng are also looking for a group of armed suspects who robbed a substantial amount of money from guards who were collecting cash at two retail stores in Kempton Park and Sebokeng on Tuesday morning.The guards were not injured but a substantial amount of money was taken.In the incident in Kempton Park a guard s firearm was also taken. We appeal to anyone with information to come forward and any information that may lead to the arrest of the suspects will be rewarded, Dlamini said.In Centurion, one suspect was shot dead, another wounded and two others arrested following a business robbery at a restaurant in Club View yesterday.The CEO of Cash Connect Management Solutions, Richard Phillips, said in order to avoid cash-in-transit robberies businesses should consider a solution that takes the cash risk and guarantees the value from the moment it is deposited into the cash vault, while in transit and until it reflects in the bank account. Business owners should consider the cost and risk that traditional cash handling processes pose. The traditional way of manually counting, re-counting and reconciling cash, produces a greater margin of human error while valuable man hours are lost in the process of trying to keep the custodians of the cash honest. The national crime statistics for the last year show a reality of 54 armed robberies of South African businesses and retailers each day.NONDUMISO ZWANEnondumisoz@thenewage.co.za
