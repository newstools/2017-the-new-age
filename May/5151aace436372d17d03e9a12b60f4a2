The DA smells a rat, and claim that the Johannesburg billing woes could be placed squarely on the door on the municipality officials who had been suspended by the council, a claim the ANC dismissed as amounting to cheap political points . The billing standoff has left more than 40 000 of Joburg customers without their monthly statements.DA mayoral committee member of finance Rabelani Dagada claimed his party suspected sabotage . In interview with a business publication, Dagada said: The city is suspicious that there are officials sabotaging us.&#8221; Dagada said the DA was of the view this was a way &#8220;to hit back at the council&#8221; because of political differences.The ANC has disregarded the DA claims of sabotage. In a statement, the ANC said: The ANC greater Johannesburg region notes Mr Mashaba&#8217;s assertion that the system was tampered with. This brings to the fore an element of suspected sabotage. As the ANC we understand that information technology systems do fail. It is ironic that when the IT systems failed during the tenure of the ANC government, the DA was quick to say that the ANC government was grossly incompetent. In this case the ANC will not fall into the trap of scoring cheap political points and say that the DA-coalition government is grossly incompetent. The ANC however blames the DA and accuses it for not doing their job . We do want to make the point that the DA-Coalition government is focusing on the wrong things. -TNA Reporter
