S A Revenue Services Customs officials intercepted a Ferrari F1, worth an estimated R13.8 million, which was being smuggled back into the country after it had been stored at a bonded warehouse in South Africa since 2014 , Sars said in a statementWhen it was first brought into the country, the owner failed to follow correct import procedures including paying the necessary customs duties and VAT. As a result, the vehicle stayed in a bonded warehouse for three years because the owner could not finalise the required customs processes, spokesperson Sandile Memela said in a statement. &#8221; Then in February 2017, the vehicle owner submitted an export declaration to take the car to the Democratic Republic of Congo through Beitbridge border post. A day later, there was an attempt to have the vehicle return to South Africa through the same border post ,&#8221; Memela said. &#8221;The vehicle has been detained and a letter of intent was issued to the owner as part of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act No 3 of 2000 to enable them to make representation to SARS. &#8221; -TNA Reporter
