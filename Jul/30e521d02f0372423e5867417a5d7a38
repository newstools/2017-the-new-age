The murder case against EFF Marikana activist Napoleon Webster and his co-accused expected to resume at the Rustenburg Magistrate&#8217;s Court on Tuesday.Webster was first arrested conjointly with other community members following a conflict over the distribution of RDP houses in Marikana.He was re-arrested for new charges of murder earlier this year after he was accused with the murder of a community member.In his last court appearance in June the court postponed the matter to July 18 as a result of a lack of a stenographer during his appearance.Webster and his co-accused are alleged to have hacked their murder victim Sabata Petros Chale to death in December last year.The dispute is believed to be as a result of the allocation of RDP houses in the area that the EFF accuses some ANC members of conducting the allocations in a corrupt manner.The murdered victim was allegedly involved in the allocation of these RDP houses in Marikana. Webster has remained behind bars for the past months while the trial proceeds.Chaos erupted during one of his previous appearances where a group of his supporters attempted to rescue him and pulled him from the Police.-TNA Reporter
