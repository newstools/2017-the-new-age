The Democratic Alliance (DA) is expected to file it&#8217;s answering affidavit with the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein on the spy tapes saga on Monday.In 2016 the High Court in Pretoria declared the decision by the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) irrational, to drop the almost 800 charges against President Jacob Zuma.The Charges against the president relating to fraud and corruption were dropped by the NPA in 2009.President Zuma and the NPA filed papers in June to appeal the court&#8217;s ruling.Zuma&#8217;s lawyers argued that the dropping of the charges against him in 2009 was not irrational. The NPA said they dropped the charges against the president as the motive behind it was politically motivated.However the court declared in 2016 that the decision was irrational. The NPA and the president reportedly approached the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein after the high court refused them leave to appeal.The DA has been fighting for the charges against the president to be reinstated since they were dropped in 2009.TNA Reporter
