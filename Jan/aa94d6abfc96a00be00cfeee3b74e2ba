&nbsp;Kaizer Chiefs back to back victories towards the end of last year have given midfielder Siphiwe Tshabalala a measure of hope ahead of the resumption of the PSL next month.Last year will go down as the one that Amakhosi and their legion of fans will want to forget quickly and they are hoping for improved fortunes this time around. Chiefs ended the year with victories over Polokwane City and Golden Arrows, which saw them move to fourth on the log standings after a frustratingly long spell of under performing. The journey so far has not been easy but that s how life deals it. I am glad to be back and preparing to resume the season along with my teammates, Tshabalala said. We closed off sitting in fourth place and that for me is not a bad place to start going forward. The team just need to make sure that we go forward by raising our performance in order to bring good results. With the PSL and Nedbank Cup the remaining trophies Amakhosi can lay their hands on, Tshabalala said they were aware that they need to win at least one trophy on offer if they are to have a relatively successful season. There s a lot happening in the team but all is well and we look forward to starting in good shape. The future is bright. Amakhosi will be opening our second half of the season with a fixture against Free State Stars on February 7. This will produce a platform for us to hit the ground running. The team have played 15 matches and have collected 24 points. There is plenty of work to be done, but we must keep in mind that Rome was not built in a day. We will take it a game at a time and build on that. The two wins before the festive break appear to have significantly lifted the morale at the club and those at Naturena will be desperate to start the new year in the same vein with a win against Stars at FNB Stadium.NEVILLE KHOZA | nevillek@thenewage.co.za
