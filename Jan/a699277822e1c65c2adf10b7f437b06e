The imminent departure of Stormers fullback Cheslin Kolbe to French Top 14 side Toulouse set to take place after the upcoming Super Rugby season has led to the Cape Town side extending the contract of hooker Bongi Mbonambi.As a way of preparing for Kolbe leaving the side, Province have already signed former Sharks, Bulls and Southern Kings fullback SP Marais.Western Province Rugby Group CEO, Paul Zacks, confirmed that Springboks hooker Mbonambi had joined players such as Jean-Luc du Plessis, Dan du Plessis, EW Viljoen, Grant Hermanus, Justin Phillips and Brandon Thomson, and forwards Chad Solomon, JD Schickerling and Kobus van Dyk, in signing long-term contracts.Former Bulls player Mbonambi made his Boks Test debut last year following an impressive Super Rugby campaign with the Stormers and has signed a new three-year contract with the Union.Zacks said it was encouraging to see talented and valuable players show confidence in the province s long-term vision. It is vital to retain talented players such as these who have signed new contracts, if we are to move forward and evolve. Of course there are many others who are on existing contracts that will also play a big role in what we have planned for the future, Zacks said.MMASEKEPE MATSEBANEmmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
