The Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa) on Tuesday said it is concerned about the appointment of former Sanral Chief Executive Officer Nazir Alli as the Chairperson of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Pasa) interim board.Alli&#8217;s appointment was announced by Transport Minister Dipuo Peters on Monday, barely a week after she dissolved the former board under the leadership of Popo Molefe.Peters said her sole objective as a shareholder at Prasa is to bring about much needed stability. I exercised the power bestowed on me to pull all stops in bringing stability and good governance at Prasa, she added.However, Outa disagreed with Alli&#8217;s appointment saying he is facing charges of perjury for misrepresenting Sanral in the Western Cape Tolling court case. Despite the fact that Mr Alli is facing a charge of perjury for his misrepresentations during Sanral s failed Western Cape Tolling court case, he was also the champion of the failed Gauteng e-tolling scheme, Portfolio Director of Outa Ben Theron said.The agency further said Alli failed as a leader at Sanral for his decision to push for a monumental waste of road-users money on DeBeer s pass Route, which was terminated since his reign. In addition, he has been embroiled in a decade-long battle with the local communities over the Wild Coast N2 Toll Road, which saw several restarts due to questionable processes being followed and an angry local community who he has been at loggerheads with.Mr Alli has also been at the forefront of other lost court challenges such as the N4 Toll road plaza near Middleburg and one related to the positioning of a toll gantry on the N1, Theron said.Meanwhile, Minister Peters said her reasons for Lestoalo s dismissal as Group Chief Executive Officer of Prasa and ultimately the devolvement of the board was due to both parties engagement on the public space&#8220;Following careful consideration of representations from both the Board and the Acting GCEO, and my observation of the deteriorating state of affairs.This, together with the continuing public spats between the Board and the former Acting Group CEO, Mr Collins Letsoalo, and in considering prudently what will be in the best interest of Prasa and the public, in accordance with Section 24(1) of the Legal Succession to the South African Transport Services Act, Act 9 of 1989, I resolved to dissolve the Board of Prasa with immediate effect, Peters said.-Sipho Jack
