Minor league Sutton United are dreaming of a draw against a second-string Arsenal when the Premier League giants come visiting for Monday&#8217;s FA Cup fifth-round clash.&#8220;I think if you see (Mesut) Ozil and (Alexis) Sanchez on the team sheet, our chance doesn&#8217;t come beyond nought,&#8221; manager Paul Doswell told reporters at the club&#8217;s Gander Green Lane ground on Thursday.&#8220;But if they put another team out then it does get up to the ones and two percents.&#8221;Arsenal were thrashed 5-1 at Bayern Munich in a last-16 first-leg Champions League match on Wednesday and the shift from the Allianz Arena to playing in front of 5,000 fans in the south-west London suburbs will come as a shock.Sutton, who beat second-tier Leeds United in the previous round, are hoping Arsene Wenger gives his stars a rest.&#8220;There&#8217;s two ways of looking at it. You either get the likes of Ozil and Sanchez and Giroud &#8212; and you can just keep naming them &#8212; in which case we would lose the game comfortably but the lads would get the experience of having played a Premier League giant,&#8221; said Doswell.&#8220;Or you go the other way and you play a team of under-23s &#8230; mixed in with one or two of their squad players, and that gives us that one percent chance that we&#8217;d be after.&#8221;&#8220;The best result for the players would be a 0-0 &#8212; for you lot probably a 3-3 or 2-2,&#8221; he added. &#8220;If we were to get a draw and we could get back to the Emirates it would be one of the biggest results in the cup&#8217;s history.&#8221;Sutton&#8217;s annual turnover of 800,000 pounds ($998,880.00)would not come close to paying the salary of a player like Sanchez, the Premier League&#8217;s top scorer.The part-timers have a wage bill of 10,000 pounds a week with the top player on 600 pounds. Most have other jobs or look after the children while partners work. Arsenal&#8217;s annual turnover is 330 million pounds.Four of the Sutton squad are ex-Arsenal, however, including defender Craig Eastmond who played alongside Theo Walcott, Cesc Fabregas and Denilson in a 2010 FA Cup tie against Stoke City.&#8220;I think half of my team support Arsenal,&#8221; said Doswell. &#8220;The chance for them to go to the Emirates and just have a great day out would probably be their preferred result.&#8221;-Reuters
