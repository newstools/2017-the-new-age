The state power utility Eskom is looking for a permanent CEO to fill the vacant position left by Brian Molefe in November last year.The entity has started advertising the position in the weekend papers and the closing date for those interested is March 20.In a dramatic move last year, Molefe voluntarily stepped down from Eskom, after being implicated extensively in the Public Protector s State of Capture report.Minister of Public Enterprises Lynne Brown has since replaced Molefe after the Eskom board s recommendation to appoint Matshela Koko as acting group chief executive of the power supplier.-TNA Reporter
