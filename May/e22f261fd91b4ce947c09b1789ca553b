A 19-year-old Thando Madida who left home last week Friday afternoon where she told the helper at home that she s going out with her friend has returned unharmed.Police Colonel Lungelo Dlamini confirmed her return.&#8220;I can confirm that Thando is home although I don&#8217;t really know where she was, &#8221; said Dlamini.Her devastated mom Sthembile Mabhida said during her interview with ANN7 online she believed that her daughter was alive. She was spotted in Rosebank with some dodgy guys and I think she left home wearing whatever she was wearing and she changed to a black outfit she was wearing when she was spotted, said the concerned mother.TNA Reporter
