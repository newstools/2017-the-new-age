Durban harbour is a step closer to reaching its full potential after acquiring the sixth of nine tugboats required by ports around the country.The new tugboat will help Durban harbour efficiently deal with its increasing load of large vessels in port. The port has been deploying a five-tug operation to help guide vessels into the port instead of the industry requirement to use a six-tug operation.A tugboat is a small but powerful vessel designed for pushing ships when docking in a busy harbour or towing ships with engine problems. Receiving the tugboat from Southern African Shipyards, which was given the R1.4bn project to build the nine new tugboats, Transnet National Ports Authority CEO Richard Vallihu said a new tug was exactly what Durban needed.The tugboat, Umbilo, is named after a suburb in Durban. It is among four that are being deployed in the province s ports of Durban and Richards Bay. Five have already been delivered to Port Elizabeth, Saldanha Bay and Richards Bay. Vallihu said it would relieve pressure on the port s marine operations and speed up turnaround times for vessels calling at the port. If we improve efficiency and turnaround times, we can reduce the cost of doing business and we can begin to attract business from elsewhere, he said, adding that South African ports had to build capability, which was difficult because it required resilience. The tug-building programme is doing just that. The next step will be for us to build our own dredgers. To further support this, we are focusing on schools that will complement our Transnet Maritime School of Excellence, Vallihu said.The nine tugs are being built for the ports authority over three and a half years as part of a wider fleet replacement programme that also includes new dredging vessels and marine aviation helicopters.SIHLE MAVUSOnews@thenewage.co.za
