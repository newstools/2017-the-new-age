Economic inequality, societal polarisation and intensifying environmental dangers are the top three trends that will shape global developments over the next 10 years, the World Economic Forum s Global Risks Report 2017 found.Collaborative action by world leaders will be urgently needed to avert further hardship and volatility in the coming decade. In this year s annual survey, some 750 experts assessed 30 global risks, as well as 13 underlying trends that could amplify them or alter the interconnections between them.Against a backdrop of mounting political disaffection and disruption across the world, three key findings emerged from the survey: Patterns persist rising income and wealth disparity and increasing polarisation of societies were ranked first and third, respectively, among the underlying trends that will determine global developments in the next 10 years. Similarly, the most interconnected pairing of risks in this year s survey is between high structural unemployment or underemployment and profound social instability; climate change was the number two underlying trend this year.And for the first time, all five environmental risks in the survey were ranked both high-risk and high-likelihood, with extreme weather events emerging as the single most prominent global risk; society is not keeping pace with technological change. Of the 12 emerging technologies examined in the report, experts found artificial intelligence and robotics to have the greatest potential benefits, but also the greatest potential negative effects and the greatest need for better governance.While the world can point to significant progress in the area of climate change in 2016, with a number of countries, including the US and China, ratifying the Paris Agreement, political change in Europe and North America puts this progress at risk. It also highlights the difficulty that leaders will face to agree on a course of action at the international level to tackle the most pressing economic and societal risks. Urgent action is needed among leaders to identify ways to overcome political or ideological differences and work together to solve critical challenges.The momentum of 2016 towards addressing climate change shows this is possible, and offers hope that collective action at the international level to reset other risks could also be achieved, Margareta Drzeniek-Hanouz, World Economic Forum s head of global competitiveness and risks, said. How to address the world s most pressing risks will be the subject of discussions at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2017, which convenes tomorrow under the theme Responsive and Responsible Leadership.Although 2016 will be remembered for dramatic political results that broke with consensus expectations, warning signs that a persistent cluster of societal and economic risks could spill over into real-world disruption have been reported in the Global Risks Report regularly during the past decade.The complex transitions that the world is going through, from preparing for a low-carbon future and unprecedented technological change to adjusting to new global economic and geopolitical realities, places even greater emphasis on leaders to practice long-term thinking, investment and international cooperation. We live in disruptive times where technological progress also creates challenges.Without proper governance and re-skilling of workers, technology will eliminate jobs faster than it creates them. Governments can no longer provide historical levels of social protection and an anti-establishment narrative has gained traction, with new political leaders blaming globalisation for society s challenges, creating a vicious cycle in which lower economic growth will only amplify inequality. Cooperation is essential to avoid the further deterioration of government finances and the exacerbation of social unrest, Cecilia Reyes, chief risk officer of Zurich Insurance Group, said.-Sello Rabothata|Sellor@thenewage.co.za
