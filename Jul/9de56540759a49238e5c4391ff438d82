US President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel plan to meet in Hamburg on Thursday, the eve of a Group of 20 summit, Merkel&#8217;s spokesman said.&#8220;Indeed a meeting with the US president is planned before the G20 summit, most probably in the early evening of Thursday,&#8221; Merkel&#8217;s spokesman Steffen Seibert said at a press briefing on Monday.Transatlantic differences on climate change, trade, refugees and other issues are expected to flare at the July 7-8 meeting of world leaders from major industrialised and emerging economies in the northern port city.Last week Merkel met with key European leaders and vowed to make a stand for climate protection and open markets at the meeting with Trump, who has said he will take the US out of the Paris climate deal and pursue a protectionist &#8220;America First&#8221; policy.Merkel said last Thursday that &#8220;the differences are obvious and it would be dishonest to try to cover that up. That I won&#8217;t do.&#8221;She also said the US exit from the 2015 Paris climate pact had made Europe &#8220;more determined than ever&#8221; to make the accord a success.More than 20,000 police will be on duty in Hamburg for the meeting, whose participants include China&#8217;s President Xi Jinping, Russia&#8217;s Vladimir Putin and Turkey&#8217;s Recep Tayyip Erdogan.More than 30 anti-capitalist protests have been scheduled for before and during the meeting.A day before the G20, Trump will head to Warsaw for a summit meeting of central and eastern European leaders likely to include Hungary&#8217;s hardline Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has sparred with western European leaders, especially on the refugee issue.-AFP
