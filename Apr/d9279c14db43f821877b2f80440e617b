French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said Thursday that &#8220;a day will come when international justice will give its verdict on Bashar al-Assad who is massacring his people.&#8221;Speaking to news channel CNEWS, he added: &#8220;These crimes must not go unpunished. In any case, there are investigations, United Nations commissions&#8230; there will be a war crimes trial.&#8221;At least 86 people were killed on Tuesday in rebel-held Khan Sheikhun in northern Syria in a suspected chemical attack that left people choking and foaming at the mouth.France is again pushing for a resolution at the United Nations to condemn the attack blamed by the West on Assad&#8217;s regime, but Ayrault did not sound optimistic after the first discussions on Wednesday at the international body.&#8220;It&#8217;s difficult because up to now every time we have presented a resolution, there has been a veto by Russia and sometimes by China &#8230; but we must cooperate because we need to stop this massacre,&#8221; he added.Moscow, which launched a military intervention in 2015 in support of Assad&#8217;s forces, has defended the Syrian government against accusations it is responsible for the attack.-AFP
