The ANC has moved to differentiate its policies on Israel from those of the DA, adding that it supported the Palestinian people as well as a fair solution to the Middle East conundrum.The ANC clarification came after the DA announced its leader had visited the Middle East and had met Israeli Prime Minister Benjanim Netanyahu as well as the leader of the Israeli opposition Bougie Hertzog.Maimane had also scheduled a meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, but it could not take place due to a scheduling conflict in Abbas s diary, the DA said in a statement.According to the DA, Maimane visited Israel and the Palestinian Territories to listen and learn about the conflict first hand and to discuss how South Africa should be playing a more constructive role in bringing the parties together for peace. He is also there as a person of faith, to visit some of the most holy places that are of spiritual meaning to him, the DA said.The DA said it was committed to a two-state solution, which is the position of the South African Government as well as the UN .Under its leadership, the DA said, South Africa would play a constructive role in bringing the two parties together instead of inflaming tensions between them .The DA aslo said that it would always place human rights at the centre of its international relations. It said the ANC had long disregarded this moral policy.However, ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa was dismissive of the DA s position. We also warn the DA not to mislead the public by suggesting that our government and our party share the same position as the DA on Palestine. The ANC not only supports a just and fair solution but we also have for several years attended, actively supported and organised international solidarity campaigns with the people of Palestine, Kodwa said.Unlike the DA, he said, the ANC was calling out Israel for its racism against African refugees. We condemn Israel s apartheid policies and its violations of international law, including the building of illegal settlements and the inhumane Gaza siege. Much like the DA wants the black majority to vote for them, they remain on the wrong side of history, choosing the oppressors and not the oppressed, Kodwa said.Kodwa said the DA and Maimane would never stand with Palestine. Equally the DA will not stand with the working class majority on issues like the land, economy, labour rights and minimum wage, he said. The DA has been completely unwilling to challenge the Israeli government on its continued abuse of human rights, and it has never acted in solidarity with Palestine even during the height of Israel s barbaric attacks on the Palestinian people of the Gaza Strip, Kodwa said.DENNIS CRUYWAGENnews@thenewage.co.za
