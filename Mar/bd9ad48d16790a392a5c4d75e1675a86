THE half-naked body of a woman has been found in a trench on the side of the Moloto Road in Vezubuhle near KwaMhlanga. The body was found yesterday morning. When The New Age arrived at the scene, on the other side of the road adjacent the scene near a tavern, there were bloodstains believed to be the of the deceased. The deceased had injuries in the thigh and the upper part of the body. A police officer at the scene, who did not want to be named as he was not assigned to communicate with the media, said the corpse was dumped along the road in order to destroy evidence and to look as if she was killed by speeding vehicles while trying to cross the busy road. The road, also known as the R573, stretches from Gauteng, via Mpumalanga to Limpopo. The policeman said their preliminary investigations discovered that the deceased might have been under the influence of alcohol when she was raped and later beaten to death because there were no signs that she was killed by a vehicle. We have no choice but to open a murder case for further investigation since our initial investigation indicates that the woman was attacked and then dumped on the side of the road as if she was killed by a speeding vehicle. The investigation also found that she could have been raped since her underwear was left on the other side of the road where an empty packet of condoms was found. The suspects killed her so that they could not be identified in an attempt to destroy our investigation, the policeman said. The deceased, in her late 40s, was identified at the scene as Shirley Miya from the nearby Phola Park village. Miya s granddaughter Busi Miya said: She was last seen on Sunday night when she left home without telling us about her trip. We could not believe it when we received a call from other people informing us about her death. FRANCE NYAKA&nbsp;
