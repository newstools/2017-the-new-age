Ambassadors of the 54 member states of the Permanent Representatives Committee (PRC) of the African Union (AU) are meeting at its headquarters in Ethiopia s capital Addis Ababa.The 33rd session of the PRC is in the framework of the 28th AU Summit that is scheduled to take place on January 30 and 31.The theme of the conference is Harnessing the Demographic Dividend through Investments in the Youth.The three-day PRC meeting, which started on Sunday, will prepare the AU Summit agenda with recommendations for consideration by the AU executive council, which includes the foreign ministers of AU member states.In her opening remarks, chair of the AU Commission Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma noted that the 28th AU Summit would deal with matters that concern the future of the continent.She said Africa, under the framework of Agenda 2063, has recorded progress in modernising agriculture and agro-processing, tackling backlogs in energy, transport, water and sanitation and in ensuring that Africa was not bypassed on the information highway and knowledge economy.She said it was important that Africa invested in the ICT sector.Dlamini Zuma said the Pan-African bloc had a major task this year in adopting the African Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA).She said a lot still needed to be done, despite the achievements on the continent. We must espouse and uphold the values of Pan-Africanism, which include putting Africa first, commitment to the African people, their dignity and aspirations, and our passion for democracy, peace, integration and development, she said.In addition to electing new officials to the AU Commission, the summit will elect Dlamini Zuma s successor and consider important issues related to the financing and institutional reforms of the AU. African ambassadors meet ahead of summit.A previous attempt to elect a successor to Dlamini Zuma in 2016 was unsuccessful when the three candidates, Pelonomi Venson-Moitoi (foreign minister, Botswana), Agapito Mba Mokuy (foreign minister, Equatorial Guinea) and Specioza Naigaga Wandira Kazibwe (former vice-president, Uganda), failed to obtain two-thirds of the vote.Member states requested that the nomination process be reopened and for elections to be postponed.When the new nomination process opened, Kazibwe withdrew while three new candidates, Moussa Faki Mahamat (foreign minister, Chad), Abdoulaye Bathily (UN special representative, Senegal) and Amina Mohamed (cabinet secretary, foreign affairs and international trade, Kenya), joined the race.TNA Reporternews@thenewage.co.za
