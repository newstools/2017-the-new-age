Gabriel Barbosa came off the bench to score his first Serie A goal as lethargic Inter Milan snatched a late 1-0 victory at Bologna on Sunday to reclaim fourth place in the standings.The 20-year-old Brazilian forward, nicknamed &#8220;Gabigol&#8221;, replaced Antonio Candreva in the 74th minute and took seven minutes to end his goal drought when he finished calmly after being picked out by Danilo D&#8217;Ambrosio&#8217;s cross.Before the youngster&#8217;s intervention, Inter had lacked the ideas and verve that have characterised recent performances under Stefano Pioli and looked set to rue a remarkable miss from Rodrigo Palacio, who fired over from four yards in the 12th minute.&#8220;In the locker room they said that Gabigol would invite everyone for a Brazilian-style dinner when he got his first goal,&#8221; Pioli told Italian television. &#8220;I&#8217;m happy for him. &#8220;He&#8217;s working hard after a troubled start which is normal for a young player coming from abroad, but he&#8217;s doing well now and the whole squad deserves credit for that.&#8221;Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic denied Vasilis Torosidis with an excellent save in stoppage-time as Bologna rallied, while the home side will feel hard done by after Eder&#8217;s blatant penalty-box foul on Blerim Dzemaili went unpunished.The win took Inter up to 48 points after 25 games, moving them back level with Atalanta and ahead of Lazio who both won on Saturday, and provisionally three points behind Napoli in the third Champions League qualifying spot ahead of their match at Chievo later on Sunday.-Reuters
