EASTERN Cape SAPS will this week host an awareness campaign against substance abuse in Port Elizabeth.The SAPS said it remains committed to preventing and combating crime. One of the fundamental ways of achieving this is through intensifying the mobilisation of communities through awareness campaigns and educational talks to both adults and children.Our primary focus is to reduce the supply and demand of illegal substances, police said in a statement. The campaign aims to strengthen police-community partnerships and to ensure that the Schools Safety Programme becomes effective and sustainable. It is against this background that Eastern Cape SAPS will host a community awareness campaign against drugs and substance abuse, police said.The event will take place at Nangoza Jebe Community Hall, Ntshekisa Road, New Brighton and later a K9 gala evening where prizes and trophies will be awarded to the winners of the national K9 competition at Boardwalk Casino, Port Elizabeth. Meanwhile, the police said they arrested more than 50 people during a weekend operation in King Williams Town. Police intensified visibility in their precinct to prevent crime. They were on foot patrols and doing stop and search as part of crime prevention. These suspects will appear in the King Williams Town Magistrate court soon, they said. In Engcobo, a 53-year-old man appeared in the magistrate s court for possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition.He was arrested by the Queenstown K9 and Flying Squad units on Sunday. King Williams Town SAPS station commander Col Andile Lamana said they would continue doing stop and searches and roadblocks.
