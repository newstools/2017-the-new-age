Manchester United continued their push for a top-four finish with a comfortable 3-0 victory at champions Leicester City on Sunday, extending their unbeaten Premier League run to 15 games.Henrikh Mkhitaryan open the scoring with a cool finish after he galloped onto Chris Smalling&#8217;s header in the 42nd minute and, with Leicester&#8217;s defence still recovering, Zlatan Ibrahimovic added a second two minutes later.Juan Mata stroked home their third goal after some delightful link up play with Mkhitaryan in the 49th and United easily closed out the game against a Leicester side who have yet to score a league goal in 2017.United stay sixth but have cut the gap to Liverpool and Arsenal, one and two points above them in fifth and fourth respectively, while Leicester are 16th &#8212; one point above the bottom three in the relegation zone.-Reuters
