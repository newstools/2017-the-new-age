He advised those deployed to shy away from anything could bring the name of the ANC into disrepute. So we wish to put it clear and categorically that there is no call on our part to review times and anything of that sort with regard to liquor availability in the liquor outlets in and around Gauteng, he saidAttempts to promote the anniversary may have turned pear-shaped as a social media campaign the party embarked on, namely #WeAreANC, was used by the Tweeter community to voice their concerns on issues such as corruption and service delivery.Replying to the questions ANC national spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said the hashtag was meant to stimulate conversation about the upcoming 105th ANC gathering and its significance. He called it a success because it had stimulated debate.Kodwa said most South Africans claimed ownership of the ANC and that the party wants citizens to talk about the kinds of values and principles that define the organisation.&#8220;In terms of this, we&#8217;ve received an overwhelming reaction about some of the things that the ANC can&#8217;t hide its head in the sand about,&#8221; he tweeted.In another tweet, he stated: &#8220;In the context of ongoing introspection, we cannot ignore what people think and how people feel about their organisation&#8221;The spokesperson said that many of the concerns raised were genuine and regrettable and that dealing with them forms part of the party s programme of organisational renewal.He said that the anniversary provided the ANC, an opportunity to recommit to the founding principles and values centred on serving the people.&#8220;I look forward to furthering this conversation about the future of our country and its leadership in a constructive manner,&#8221; he said.-TNA Reporter
