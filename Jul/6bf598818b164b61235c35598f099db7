New signing Dominic Solanke came off the bench to score as Liverpool beat Crystal Palace 2-0 in a preseason game in Hong Kong on Wednesday.The 19-year-old suggested he could prove a summer bargain at just $4 million as he linked up well with fellow striker Divock Origi, who also got on the scoresheet in the Premier League Asia Trophy win.&#8220;It&#8217;s been a smart move for him and for us,&#8221; Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said of Solanke&#8217;s transfer from Chelsea.&#8220;He saw the opportunity and we could see it also. You could see immediately he is a smart player. He&#8217;s a skilled boy and we are happy about this. We will help him all we can.&#8221;Origi set up the first goal for Liverpool on the hour mark with a clever back-heel that found Solanke unmarked and the teenager made no mistake, finishing coolly in the stifling Hong Kong heat.Origi then rifled home Liverpool&#8217;s second in the 79th minute, to the delight of a crowd of 40,000.Klopp&#8217;s new-look front line proved a welcome distraction for the German coach following reports that Leipzig had rejected a huge bid of $86 million for star midfielder Naby Keita.Klopp bristled when asked about the Keita situation as rumours circled that the Guinea international&#8217;s agent had been spotted in Hong Kong.&#8220;Are we in Macau?&#8221; asked Klopp in reference to the world&#8217;s largest gambling hub, situated just across the Pearl River Delta from Hong Kong.&#8220;What do you know? Sixty-six million (pounds) turned down today? I don&#8217;t think about this.&#8220;Today both teams played good football,&#8221; added Klopp, turning his attention back to events on the pitch.&#8220;In the second half we made some changes and we scored &#8212; nice. We changed the formation and it was nice to watch.&#8221;Liverpool will face Leicester City in the Asia Trophy final on Saturday after the Foxes won the earlier match 7-6 on penalties over West Bromwich Albion following a 1-1 stalemate in normal time.New signing Jay Rodriguez gave West Brom the lead with a stunning finish after nine minutes, only for Riyad Mahrez to squeeze the ball past Ben Foster to level things up midway through the first half.&#8220;Jay&#8217;s strike was fantastic,&#8221; said West Brom boss Tony Pulis.&#8220;The lad was always a very good player &#8212; he&#8217;s just had a couple of bad injuries that set him back and he&#8217;s not really got himself in position to get a run of games.&#8221;-AFP
