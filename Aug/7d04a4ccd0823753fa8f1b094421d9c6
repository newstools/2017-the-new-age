Chairperson of Parliaments Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA) Themba Godi, has commended news channel ANN7 for unearthing the mismanagement that has plagued governments Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS).This comes after a National Treasury team today briefed the watchdog committee on the challenges experienced with the IFMS project which has cost tax-payers R1.2 billion but has borne no fruit.&#8221; I learned about this IFMS challenge from ANN7 and I think ANN7 did a great job on this one. There were a lot of doubting Thomases but as the information kept coming in it became clear that it could no longer be denied,&#8221; said Godi.Earlier this year an ANN7 expos blew the lid on the mismanagement of the project which was meant to integrate human resource payroll financial and supply chain management functions in the public service.The expose was based on an internal audit report which indicated that this office within the National Treasury was guilty of gross financial irregularities.Today, Director-General at Treasury, Dondo Mogajane told SCOPA that he has with the permission of Minister Malusi Gigaba stopped all IFMS related payments.Mogajane added that along with stopping all IFMS payments, he had elected to restructure the entire management team around the project.Minister Gigaba today revealed that Treasury has requested the Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors (IRBA) to institute an investigation against audit firm Deloitte to determine if its conduct was consistent with that required of an audit firm.According to the minister, the audit firm had requested a guarantee of future work to be provided by the department, while producing shoddy work.-TNA Reporter
