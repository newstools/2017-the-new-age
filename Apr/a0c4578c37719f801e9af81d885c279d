On the eve of the 2017 New York International Auto Show, Jaguar&#8217;s first-ever SUV, the F-Pace, has been named the 2017 World Car of the Year.In doing so, the lightweight off-roader has essentially come up from behind to beat off stiff SUV competition from two of the world&#8217;s biggest German marques, VW and Audi, whose latest mid-size crossovers, the Tiguan and Q5 respectively had also made the final shortlist.And as well as taking away the top award, the F-Pace also scooped this year&#8217;s statute in the design category &#8212; an award open to any car nominated in any category.&#8220;The F Pace was designed and engineered as a performance SUV With exceptional dynamics, everyday usability and bold design. Winning these two awards endorses the talent and great work of our teams that have delivered the world&#8217;s most practical sports car and Jaguar&#8217;s fastest selling vehicle,&#8221; said Dr Ralf Speth, CEO, Jaguar Land Rover.However, in the luxury car category, it was business as usual with the Mercedes E-Class scooping this year&#8217;s award, ahead of the Volvo S90 and the BMW 5-Series.Although the World Car of the Year awards are now an established part of the New York Auto Show, this year saw the first award for World Urban Car, a new sub-category introduced to reflect the growing competition and innovation in the city and compact car segment globally.And the first-ever winner is the plug-in electric BMW i3, which was up against the Suzuki Ignis and Citro n C3. &#8220;This award highlights BMW Group&#8217;s commitment to sustainable mobility through BMW&#8217;s first all-electric vehicle made primarily of carbon fiber,&#8221; said Ludwig Willisch, Head of BMW Group Region Americas.The award for World Performance Car of the Year went to a Porsche, for the fifth time in 13 years &#8212; the new four-cylinder 718 Cayman, and its soft-top sibling the Boxster. An impressive achievement considering it was up against the McLaren 570S and the Audi R8 Spyder.But perhaps the biggest surprise at this year&#8217;s awards show is that the Toyota Prius hybrid took home the Green Car Award. It was up against the Chevrolet Bolt &#8212; winner of the 2017 North American Car of the Year award and the Tesla Model X plug-in electric SUV.&#8220;Consideration for this award is a testament to our focus on developing products that both stir the emotions and meet the mobility needs of our customers in all corners of the world,&#8221; said Jack Hollis, Group VP of Toyota division.-Relaxnews
