Romantic showbiz musical &#8220;La La Land&#8221; topped the Oscars nominations list on Tuesday with a whopping 14 nods, tying the all-time record set by &#8220;Titanic&#8221; and &#8220;All About Eve.&#8221;The movie &#8212; a whimsical tribute to Hollywood&#8217;s Golden Age of musicals, set in modern-day Los Angeles &#8212; earned nods for best picture, best director for 32-year-old Damien Chazelle, and for its two stars, Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.In second place were sci-fi thriller &#8220;Arrival&#8221; and coming-of-age drama &#8220;Moonlight,&#8221; tied at eight nominations each.But &#8220;La La Land&#8221; is now well-placed as the film to beat at the Oscars bash on February 26 &#8212; the climax of Hollywood&#8217;s awards season, to be hosted by late night funnyman Jimmy Kimmel.Chazelle said he was &#8220;stunned and in a daze&#8221; after learning of his movie&#8217;s record-breaking day.&#8220;The one thing I can say without sounding like a stuttering maniac is this means that so many people who came together to make this movie for me have been recognized, and that just means the world to me,&#8221; he was quoted as saying by trade magazine Variety.This year&#8217;s crop of nominees clearly reflected a push by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences voters to show more diversity after the #OscarsSoWhite controversy of the past two years.The list features the largest number of nominations for black actors ever six.Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris are first-time nominees for &#8220;Moonlight,&#8221; while two-time winner DenzelWashington and multiple nominee Viola Davis are in the running again for their performance in &#8220;Fences.&#8221;Also nominated are past winner Octavia Spencer, a best supporting actress candidate for &#8220;Hidden Figures,&#8221; and Ruth Negga, in the best actress category for &#8220;Loving.&#8221;&#8211; Nine best picture nominees &#8211;Industry watchers had predicted that Chazelle&#8217;s &#8220;La La Land&#8221; buoyed by a record seven Golden Globe awards earlier this month would triumph at the nominations.But few thought it would tie for the all-time record. &#8220;Titanic&#8221; went on to win 11 Oscars, while &#8220;All About Eve&#8221; starring Bette Davis won six.&#8220;La La Land&#8221; will vie for best picture honors with eight other films (current rules allow for up to 10 nominees in this category) including &#8220;Arrival,&#8221; grim family drama &#8220;Manchester by the Sea&#8221; and &#8220;Moonlight,&#8221; the coming-of-age tale of a black man in Miami.Others in the coveted top category are the film adaptation of August Wilson&#8217;s play &#8220;Fences,&#8221; Mel Gibson&#8217;s bloody WWII drama &#8220;Hacksaw Ridge,&#8221; the western crime drama &#8220;Hell or High Water,&#8221; the real-life tale of NASA&#8217;s black female mathematicians &#8220;Hidden Figures&#8221; and Garth Davis&#8217;s family drama &#8220;Lion.&#8221;&#8211; Streep dancing for joy over 20th nod &#8211;For best actor, Gosling will battle for a golden statuette with Golden Globe winner Casey Affleck (&#8220;Manchester by the Sea&#8221;), Andrew Garfield (&#8220;Hacksaw Ridge&#8221;), Viggo Mortensen (&#8220;Captain Fantastic&#8221;) and Washington.In the best actress category, France&#8217;s Golden Globe winner Isabelle Huppert was nominated for her performance in the rape-revenge thriller &#8220;Elle,&#8221; along with Stone, Negga, Natalie Portman (&#8220;Jackie&#8221;) and Meryl Streep, who earned her record-breaking 20th nomination for &#8220;Florence Foster Jenkins.&#8221;Streep&#8217;s nod delighted social media users, who called it a fitting rebuke to President Donald Trump, who described her as &#8220;overrated&#8221; after she denounced him at the Golden Globes.The 67-year-old actress &#8212; who broke her own record as the person with the most acting nominations &#8212; reacted with a GIF featuring her dancing for joy in footage from a past film.&#8211; Comeback for Mel Gibson &#8211;In the best supporting actress category, Davis, Spencer and Harris will compete against past Oscar winner Nicole Kidman (&#8220;Lion&#8221;) and Michelle Williams (&#8220;Manchester by the Sea&#8221;), who was nominated three times before.In the best supporting actor category, Ali will take on Jeff Bridges (&#8220;Hell or High Water&#8221;), Dev Patel (&#8220;Lion&#8221;), Lucas Hedges (&#8220;Manchester by the Sea&#8221;) and Michael Shannon (&#8220;Nocturnal Animals&#8221;).The foreign films nominated are &#8220;Land of Mine&#8221; (Denmark), &#8220;A Man Called Ove&#8221; (Sweden), &#8220;The Salesman&#8221; (Iran), &#8220;Tanna&#8221; (Australia) and &#8220;Toni Erdmann&#8221; (Germany).In the best director category, Gibson&#8217;s surprise nomination for the critically acclaimed WWII biopic &#8220;Hacksaw Ridge&#8221; marks his comeback a decade after being ostracized by Hollywood for an anti-Semitic tirade captured on tape.Tuesday&#8217;s nominations were also notable in that they marked the first time a streaming service Amazon Studios earned a best picture nod, for &#8220;Manchester by the Sea.&#8221;The nominations were revealed in the pre-dawn hours in Los Angeles in an online broadcast, not at the traditional press conference.Industry pundits had predicted that a number of black actors and filmmakers would be recognized this year, after calls for a boycott erupted last year when no black actors were among the 20 nominees in the main acting categories.In a bid to address the issue, the Academy subsequently named nearly 700 new members, almost half of them women and nearly as many people of color.The Academy&#8217;s board of governors has vowed to double the number of female and ethnic minority members by 2020.-AFP
