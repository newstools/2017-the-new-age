The Gauteng education department has expressed its disappointment at the cancellation of a meeting with the school governing body and parents of Noordgesig Primary School. Parents at the school near Soweto are unhappy with the appointment of a new principal who was expected to start working on Friday. The parents have accused the department of appointing the new principal without consulting them properly. Department spokesperson Steve Mabona said the parents refused to have a meeting with officials, demanding only to speak to MEC Panyaza Lesufi or the head of department (HOD). “We are hopeful that the meeting with the MEC and the HOD will take place tomorrow,” Mabona said. The parents believe that the principal who acted in the position for two years is well-suited for the job. -TNA Reporter
