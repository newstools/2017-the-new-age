THE world s youngest author, South African-born Stacey Fru 10, is preparing for the launch of her two books, Smelly Cats (2015), and Bob And The Snake (2016), on June 22 at the Savoy Library in Johannesburg.The excited 10-year-old published author spoke to The New Age about her mission in making the history books as the first ever author to have published 10 books by the time she reaches Grade 10, adding that the launch was one of the ways she could inspire other young people to follow their dreams. This is all for inspiration and the love for our children, our future. People should come out in their numbers so that they can be inspired by the child from their own neighbourhood, who has managed to publish two books by the age of 10, she said.The young author said her inspiration to write was sparked in 2014, when her mother, submitted a book for her masters without telling her. When my mother did her masters graduation, I saw a book that people were showing off during the party.I burst out crying as it was unfair that she wrote a book without telling me. I soon vowed to do the same and wrote my own book without telling her. Only my brother knew, but I don t think that he really understood, Fru said. Her first book, written at the age of seven and published at the age of eight, won first prize at the 2016 NDA in the best ECD publication 2015: special mention category.Other notable awards that she has received include the Young Leader 2016 award and a special mention by LeadSA in November 2016. Fru is not resting on her early success as the world s youngest author as she plans to publish her third book, Smelly Cats On Vacation later on in the year.Not only is she an enterprising model for the youth, but is also a child protection activist, who began writing at age of seven, is a motivational speaker, ballerina and even a chair lady.SIYABONGA SITHOLE
