The post-mortem will be done on Thursday. There are no reports of assault, but the post-mortem will confirm the cause of death. Nnadi died in December at the Grand Parade in Cape Town after allegedly being choked by metro police while handcuffed.The police claimed that he was arrested after being caught carrying drugs, which he later swallowed.But the police version of events have been disputed by some eye witnesses.They have claimed that he was strangled and killed while handcuffed. President of the Nigerian Union in the Western Cape, Rapuluchukwu Ufochukwu, said that members of the metro police handcuffed and strangled Nnadi until he died.zodidim@thenewage.co.za
