IN WHAT appeared to be a jibe at Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa s dealings, ANC KwaZulu-Natal chairperson Sihle Zikalala said the province doesn t want leaders who benefit from mines.Zikalala made the statement during a joint press briefing of the provincial working committees for KZN and Free State, which was held at the Coastlands Hotel in Umhlanga on Monday. They want leaders who will not be apologetic for utilising mines for the benefit of South Africans, not selfish interests, Zikalala said.He also stuck to his guns after he said branches in the province are adamant that they want leaders who will push for the expropriation of land without compensation.Zikalala said it was clear that KZN ANC branches want decisive leadership. We need leadership that will ensure unity in the ANC. Someone who will fight and stamp out factionalism. Leaders who will ensure that SA and its economy are focused on serving the people.
