The department of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, quoting the Food and Agriculture Organisation, defines the agro-processing industry as a subset of manufacturing that processes raw materials and intermediate products derived from the agricultural sector.The department of economic, small development, tourism and environmental affairs in the Free State wants to make this a reality.With the aim to revive this sector the department set out by giving 15 farming enterprises an opportunity to present their business projects and concepts to potential investors who may provide financial, procurement and mentoring support.The department further said that agro-processing encompasses post-harvest activities, comprising artisanal, minimally processed and packaged agricultural raw materials. The aim of this project is to unlock the opportunities for farming enterprises to enhance agro-processing in the province. It is also envisaged that the event will create a platform where stakeholders and enterprises involved in agro-processing can interact, collaborate, identify challenges and appropriate interventions, bench-mark, share best practices and share information and data in the development of it agro-processing in the province, the Destea said.This was said by the Destea after a Free State Agro-Processing Summit which was held two months ago by the Free State department of agriculture and rural development.According to the deputy director general, Mbulelo Noqweku, due to the overload of information during the summit small businesses which were present couldn t present what they could do. The agro-processing pitching event was scheduled as a day when businessmen and women would receive their chance to pitch for investment.At the event, MEC Dr Benny Malakoane said that possible funders were decision makers therefore should guarantee the pitchers assistance in whatever they need help with. We took it upon ourselves to come up with a sort of a plan to which invites them to pitch for co-investment or for funders to come and listen, he said. Malakoane said various means were available to propel these enterprises through loans.The pitching panel of investors was divided into categories which included funding institutions, enterprise support, training and big business, ensuring all aspects of business development and support are covered.The UN International Standard Industrial Classification has classified standard agro-processing products as food and beverages, tobacco products, paper and wood products, textile, footwear and apparel, leather products and rubber products.Restrictive historical legislation proliferation of private standards raw material supply challenges national economic growth, employment and food security, potential under-realised limited market access by smallholder farmers, however, for the purposes of this document the focus will be at the processing/value-adding levels of the value chain).The department of agriculture, forestry and fisheries said the result of market access combined with limited value addition by smallholders was well documented with a high degree of market concentration in agro-processing. A limited amount of value addition by smallholder farmers, limited participation of SMEs in agro-food chains, inadequate enterprise development incentives, supply-side constraints such as skills, technology and infrastructure, the document said. This market concentration occurs in low- to middle-income countries and is manifested first in the domination of supermarkets at the downstream end of the supply chain, putting pressure on upstream food processors to compete for valuable retail shelf space. This has resulted in some cases in mergers and acquisitions in the processing sector as small and medium-scale processors are less able to meet the volumes needed to become listed suppliers, the document said.HLONI MASHIGOprovinces@thenewage.co.za
