Swiss food giant Nestle said Thursday that its headline profits were hit by one-off tax effects in 2016, and expressed caution for the outlook for the current year.Nestle said in a statement that its bottom-line net profit fell by 5.9 percent to 8.5 billion Swiss francs (eight billion euros $8.5 billion) in 2016.The number was &#8220;impacted by several items, the largest one being a one-off non-cash adjustment to deferred taxes,&#8221; the statement said.Underlying or operating profit edged up by two percent to 13.7 billion Swiss francs.Group revenues inched up by 0.8 percent to 89.5 billion Swiss francs.But so-called &#8220;organic&#8221; sales, which Nestle sees as a more accurate measure of its overall performance because it takes into account currency effects and changes in the group structure, grew by 3.2 percent.&#8220;Our 2016 organic growth was at the high end of the industry but at the lower end of our expectations,&#8221; said chief executive Mark Schneider.&#8221;In 2017, we expect organic growth between two and four percent.&#8221;Nestle had previously set itself a target of organic growth of five-to-six percent, but has scaled back those ambitions in recent years in face of sluggish consumption in Europe and the United States and a slowdown in growth in emerging economies.&#8220;In order to drive future profitability, we plan to increase restructuring costs considerably in 2017,&#8221; said CEO Schneider.In 2016, restructuring costs amounted to 300 million Swiss francs.-AFP
