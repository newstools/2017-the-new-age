THE event was always going to be about sprint king Usain Bolt and rightly so. After all, the world s greatest sprinter ever was bidding farewell to his legion of fans when he was racing on home soil for the last time at the sold out Salute A Legend event on Saturday night.The 30-year-old Jamaican marked an emotional farewell by winning his final 100m before he heads for London where he will retire after the World Championships. But Wayde van Niekerk wasn t just lost in the small print of the big stories coming out of Jamaica, as the 400m Olympic record holder produced another record-shattering performance in the 200m event.The SA and Olympic champion reclaimed the 200m record held by Anaso Jobodwana when he powered to victory in a time of 19.84 at the meeting in Kingston, Jamaica. Van Niekerk became the first South African to beat the 20-second barrier in the 200m when he clocked 19.97 at a meeting in Lucerne.But Jobodwana brought it down as he set the mark of 19.87 for a bronze medal at the IAAF World Championships in Beijing. To date, Jobodwana had been remembered for his bronze-winning performance, a performance he hasn t been able to replicate since. But he would have had mixed feelings seeing Van Niekerk shave 0.03 off his mark as he also regained his lead in the world.Van Niekerk, who also set his seventh career record, watched his world s best time of 19.90 get beaten by American Christian Coleman who clocked 19.85 last month. He also lowered his personal best of 19.90, which he set when he won the SA title in Potchefstroom in April, by 0.06 as he finished well ahead of Commonwealth champion Rasheed Dwyer who came second at the Bolt Invitational event Coming here and running a personal best and a national record is amazing, Van Niekerk said.Meanwhile, Akani Simbine came second to former world champion Yohan Blake in the 100m in the other race, unable to pick up following the start. Blake clocked 9.97 while Simbine finished in the time of 10.00. Athletics South Africa said Van Niekerk s national record is subject to a standard ratification process.kgomotsos@thenewage. co.za-Kgomotso Sethusha
