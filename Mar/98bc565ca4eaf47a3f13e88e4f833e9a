Ajax Cape Town is eyeing their first premier league win of 2017 as they prepare for their home match against Free State Stars at the Athlone Stadium on Friday evening. The Urban warriors are yet to taste victory this year as their long run of draws extends. They extended their draw results score board to a third successive draw in their league games when they played to a 0-0 draw against SuperSport United on March 4. The Urban Warriors currently stand at the 12th position in the premiership after 20 matches played. They have only managed to bag 21 points at this stage. Meanwhile their opponent still has a wounded ego as they have just come from a disappointing clash with a 0-1 defeat by new comers Highlands Park at the Goble Park Stadium on March 5. Ea Lla Koto is placed just behind Ajax in the 14th position on the log with 18 points. Both the teams have played equal number of games so far. Having met in 27 head to head league matches, the urban warriors trail behind in wins as Ea Lla koto has won more of their matches. The Urban Warriors have only won 7 times in their clashes while Free State Stars has won 13 games with the seven others being draws. When the two sides met in the opening games of the season they played to a draw in Free State. The match which is the only premiership match of the day, is scheduled to start at 8pm at the Athlone Stadium on Friday. -TNA Reporter
