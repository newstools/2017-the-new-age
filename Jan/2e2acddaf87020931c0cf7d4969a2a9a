Serena Williams was troubled by windy conditions and some early rust before beating 69th-ranked Pauline Parmentier 6-3, 6-4 to launch her comeback from a four-month lay-off at the Auckland Classic on Tuesday.In her first outing since she was shocked by Karolina Pliskova in the US Open semi-finals in September, the world number two made a sluggish start to a season in which she is seeking a record 23rd Grand Slam title.In her first-round match, delayed from Monday night when rain washed out play, Williams struggled initially as France&#8217;s Parmentier broke the American&#8217;s first service game and then held to love.The 35-year-old Williams, using Auckland to warm up for the Australian Open, only had a 48 percent success rate with her first serve and double-faulted four times as she had trouble adjusting to the swirling wind.But Williams &#8212; who shares the Open-era record of 22 Grand Slams with Steffi Graf, and is two behind Margaret Court&#8217;s all-time record of 24 &#8212; grew steadily stronger and finished with her eighth ace.She said her rhythm returned as the match progressed.&#8220;I&#8217;m feeling like I&#8217;m trying to get there. Obviously every match counts,&#8221; she said.&#8220;This wind was getting to me. Every day I&#8217;ve practised here there was no wind and of course today I played and it&#8217;s so windy. It wasn&#8217;t fun, it was interesting.&#8221;After Williams dropped her opening service game, she fought back from 3-1 down to win five successive games to take the opening set.Both players suffered service breaks at the start of the second set before Williams broke again to go 4-3 up. She then came from three break points down to claim the crucial eighth game and went on to take the match in 75 minutes.-AFP
