China&#8217;s giant Tencent Holdings has taken a five percent stake in the Tesla electric car company as it moves to ramp up production, according to an official filing Tuesday.Tencent paid about $1.8 billion for the small share of Elon Musk&#8217;s company, according to the document filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The Chinese technology company runs WeChat, the world&#8217;s most popular messaging service, as well as many mobile game platforms.In a statement last week on 2016 earnings it mentioned plans to expand its smartphone games, and move into other emerging technologies, including cloud services.Tesla, meanwhile, is planning to launch a mid-priced version of it&#8217;s all-electric car this year to tap into a broader market.The company forecast in February that demand for its cars would show strong growth in the first half of this year, as orders for some models hit a record high, even while posting a loss at the end of last year.Tesla in January also launched a &#8220;Gigafactory&#8221; with Panasonic to mass produce the lithium-ion battery cells used in energy storage products and the Model 3, which is priced at a moderate $35,000.-AFP
