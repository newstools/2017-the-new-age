Kaizer Chiefs coach Steve Komphela won t be reading too much into Orlando Pirates struggles ahead of the Soweto derby at FNB Stadium on Saturday.However, looking at recent results, Chiefs have a definite edge over their Soweto rivals who are yet to win in their last 11 matches. Chiefs are yet to lose in their last seven matches and are clear favourites to win the derby on Saturday, but Komphela won t be taking too much for granted. A lack of pressure brings complacency. If you don t feel pressure you get too comfortable and nothing works, Komphela said. So you must consistently invite pressure to be productive. Maybe we can say Chiefs have been doing better than Pirates and maybe people coming to the match could say they expect Chiefs to win. But all that is thrown out of the window when it is a derby. Chiefs also appear to have the edge in terms of their set play. They are threatening with free kicks and corner kicks, having scored several goals from setpieces.And this is the department where Pirates are struggling to cope with, as most of their goals have been conceded in set-pieces. Komphela will want to use that to Chiefs advantage with Siphiwe Tshabalala, Lorenzo Gordinho, and Daniel Cardoso all on song. Against Ajax, possession was a plus for us. We played well throughout the entire 90 minutes and this factor we will take into the next match. Chiefs look more settled than Pirates in terms of their consistent starting line-up and Komphela admitted that this was also a plus for them come the derby clash .-Neville Khoza|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
