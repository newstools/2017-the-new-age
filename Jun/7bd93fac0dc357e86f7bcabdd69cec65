The chairperson of the SAA board Dudu Myeni, who was last year reappointed for one more year, seems to have lost the confidence of the body that she is supposed to lead.Yesterday, she and the board were due to brief the standing committee for finance on the airline s quarterly report. But she arrived at Parliament as the sole representative of the 12-person board.Members of Parliament, apart from a lone ANC voice in Peace Mabe, were united in their view that she should not be allowed to present her report.Mabe clashed with committee chairperson Yunus Carrim, who was critical of Miyeni being allowed to address the committee.Mabe said the ANC had not taken a position on SAA. She also warned her ANC colleagues on the committee not to take sides with opposition parties. Myeni s apparent abandonment was not lost on DA member of Parliament Alf Lees. None of the key players are here today. It does seem that the chair of the board has lost control of her board members, he said.In a bizarre twist to the meeting, it emerged that Black First Land First (BLF) movement had written to the committee to demand that former finance minister Pravin Gordhan should recuse himself from yesterday s meeting.However, Gordhan is a member of the public enterprises portfolio committee and not part of the standing committee on finance.BLF president Andile Mngxitama claimed that Gordhan was not impartial because he was beholden to white monopoly capital .He said: In all of the above circumstances, there is clearly a strong apprehension of bias on the part of Pravin Gordhan. He is to this end conflicted, compromised and captured by white settler monopoly capital and consequently not a fit and proper person to be part of or sitting on the standing committee on finance and considering issues and questions arising out of the briefing by SAA. He must, in the first place, recuse himself from this matter for the reasons indicated above and secondly he must be removed as a member of the standing committee on finance. Gordhan must go! According to SAA s presentation it has sustained more than R4bn losses but aims to increase its revenue by R13.6bn over the next five years.Part of the strategy to turn SAA around includes taking remedial action on certain loss-making routes, exploring opportunistic flying to improve aircraft utilisation, improving labour productivity and renegotiating onerous agreements and return conditions on the leases of the freighters and wide-body aircraft.DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
