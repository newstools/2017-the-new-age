Viola Davis on Sunday won the best supporting actress Golden Globe for the big screen adaptation of August Wilson&#8217;s play &#8220;Fences&#8221; &#8212; the story of a working-class African-American family in the 1950s.Davis bested Naomie Harris (&#8220;Moonlight&#8221;), Nicole Kidman (&#8220;Lion&#8221;), Octavia Spencer (&#8220;Hidden Figures&#8221;) and Michelle Williams (&#8220;Manchester by the Sea&#8221;).&#8220;It&#8217;s not every day that Hollywood thinks of translating a play to screen. It doesn&#8217;t scream moneymaker, you know? But it does scream art. It does scream heart,&#8221; said Davis, who also won a Tony for the same role.She thanked co-star and director Denzel Washington, calling him an &#8220;extraordinary leader.&#8221; Washington is nominated in the best actor category.She dedicated the award to her father Dan Davis.&#8220;Born in 1936, groomed horses, had a fifth grade education, didn&#8217;t know how to read until he was 15. But you know what? He had a story. And it deserved to be told. And August Wilson told it,&#8221; she told the audience at the Beverly Hilton.-AFP
