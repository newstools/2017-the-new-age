The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) has launched an investigation into a case of death in Police custody.This comes after a Nigerian man died in police custody after being arrested in Cape Town last week in what is reported as a case of police brutality .The Ipid&#8217;s National Spokesperson Moses Dlamini says that they are investigating the case and they will make an announcement of their findings whether the police acted unlawfully or not.&#8221; If they found out that the police acted unlawfully the law will take its course ,&#8221; Dlamini said.It is alleged that the Nigerian man Victor Tochukwu Nnandi was being arrested by the police who were out on operation for dealing with drugs.The Police came across him where upon realising that the police were on to him he swallowed the drugs that he was trying to sell .It is alleged that the victim swallowed the drugs that were in his possession as soon as police approached him. There was an outcry by Nigerian nationals that such cases of police brutality and mishandling of Nigerian foreigners were rife in Cape Town and in the country .Furthermore Dlamini said that the police officers implicated in the Nigerian man&#8217;s case are still working pending the investigations of the Ipid into the matter. The Ipid said that there are no similar cases that they are dealing with that they know of ,this brings the number of foreign nationals killed in south Africa to 20 in 2016 .Meanwhile the Ipid is investigating another case in Limpopo where it is alleged that two police officers killed a man by dragging him alongside a police van in Limpopo . The 25 year old died from the injuries he sustained after he was dragged allegedly by two police officers in a speeding police van on New Years Day . Efforts to get the police to comment on the matter were unsuccessful-TNA Reporter
