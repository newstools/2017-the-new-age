Residents of Vuwani are expected to make submissions on why they don t want to be incorporated into Malamulele Municipality. This follows a decision which was taken by the Pro-Makhado Demarcation Board Task Team (Community driven) to incorporate Vuwani area with Malamulele in order to form a new municipality to be established at Malamulele. Pro-Makhado Demarcation Board Task Team (Community driven) spokesperson Arnold Mulaudzi said Our people have voiced their anger from the onset saying they don t want to be part of that municipality and we have taken the matter to court . The government ordered the residents to participate in the Municipal Elections, but Vuwani residents refused to register to vote for the new municipality. They are adamant to leave Makhado Municipality. Residents went on a rampage after a court ruling to merge Vuwani and Malamulele municipality. At least 20 schools were torched during violent protests in the area. And 2600 learners, of the 10 000 affected by the torching of the schools, are in matric. The Limpopo provincial government together with the Board have allowed residents to submit proposals on whether they are against the merge or their for it. Early last year the National Government had establish an inter ministerial task team which was looking on how the residents would like to see happening on which areas would be included into the demarcation. Provincial spokesperson Phuti Seloba said: The process will continues until the late hours of this afternoon with the objective to find peace and stability in the area . During last year&#8217;s Local Government Elections resident boycotted election and shut down the area from May 1 to August 3 . -TNA Reporter&nbsp;
