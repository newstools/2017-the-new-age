The combination of corruption, maladministration by public institutions, and state capture by narrow vested interests will profoundly undermine economic transformation unless a credible growth strategy is implemented.This is the view of Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel, according to a reply he gave to a written question from the DA s economic development spokesperson, Micheal Cardo.Cardo had asked him about his department s working definition of radical economic transformation and how it planned to translate it into programmes in 2017-18.Patel said: Corruption, maladministration by public institutions and state capture by narrow vested interests will profoundly undermine economic transformation. He added: Any programme that will see the majority of citizens benefitting from economic transformation must entail fighting corruption and attempts at state capture. He said that in the context of South Africa s challenges, radical economic transformation was about ensuring growth that directly, sustainably and expeditiously promoted national development goals.These were focused on addressing the high levels of poverty, inequality and unemployment. The country needed faster, more inclusive and job-rich growth so that the economy could generate the resources to meet these defining challenges, he said.Transformation included two key components , the first of which was to grow the size and resilience of the economy.The second would be to improve the participation by and benefits of black citizens in the economy. The ratings downgrade is bad news for our efforts to grow the economy at a faster and more inclusive level. We need to take steps to ensure we regain investment-grade status from lenders and pursue a credible, bold inclusive growth strategy for our people. In the medium to long term, said Patel, the levels of domestic savings must be increased to enable South Africa to finance more of its growth efforts from internal resources. Foreign investment will remain an important source of innovation, new technology and market access and must be encouraged, particularly in sectors where domestic capabilities are limited, he said.On the increased participation of black South Africans in the economy, Patel said a programme aimed at enriching a small number of persons would not address gaping levels of inequality, provide social stability and be sustainable. The high levels of wealth and economic concentration act to deter and at times inhibit new entrants from securing space in the economy, he said.Pervasive exclusionary conduct, many examples of which the competition authorities have begun to uncover over the past few years, was aggravating the situation, he said.This meant both the structural and corporate behaviour challenges in the economy needed to be addressed to enable a more open, competitive and dynamic economy to develop.He said radical, in the above context of economic transformation, referred to ensuring transformation was bold, extensive and implemented expeditiously.DENNIS CRUYWAGENnews@thenewage.co.za
