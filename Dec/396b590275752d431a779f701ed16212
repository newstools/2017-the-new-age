The Umkhonto weSizwe (MK) national council has on Friday said that African National Congress (ANC) presidential race candidates must assist in bringing back the ANC’s integrity. Deputy Minister of Justice and Correctional Services Thabang Makwetla said this as he was briefing the media on MK plans for the ANC 54 National Conference. “Events of the recent months and weeks continue to absolve them thus the ANC would be better served by convening a special conference to address the challenges,” said Makwetla. He added that however, as disciplined members of the organisation they have considered it appropriate to respect the majority that the conference should go ahead. Makwatla also stated that as the MK they have prepared themselves to constructively optimise the opportunities the conference accords them to advance the desire to restore and preserve the institution. “To the branch delegates of the ANC, our message is: ‘let’s appreciate the enormity and sensitivity of the moment upon us in our organisation’s history.” During the briefing, Makwatla also touched on the importance of the structure of the ANC to follow its strategy and that they need to bring about changes within the organisation. The MK National council urged President Jacob Zuma to comply with Wednesday’s judgment that ruled that he should be personally liable for legal costs incurred to review the State Capture report.
