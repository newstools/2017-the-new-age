Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has used ambiguous wording, misappropriation and unlawful use of funds. This is according to senior council for Absa Bank Gilbert Marcus. The Public Protector is been hauled to court by Absa, National Treasury and the South African Reserve Bank (Sarb), who are seeking to challenge her report into the Absa bailout (Bankorp) lifeboat. The report ordered that Absa pay back more than R1 billion it allegedly unlawfully received as a bailout during apartheid from the Reserve Bank. During his argument, Marcus accused Mkhwebane of altering her report on the remedial action, adding that was not the first time she had done that. “The Public Protector uses ambiguous wording; ‘misappropriation and unlawful use of funds’. She altered her report on the remedial action, it is not required that the court take measures. This is not the first time the Public Protector does something of this nature,” Marcus said. He told the Pretoria High court that Mkhwebane’s remedial action was a direct consequence of her findings, adding that her interpretation of the remedial action was incorrect. Marcus went on to lambast Mkhwebane on her lack of fairness, saying she did not afford the bank an opportunity, despite it requesting a meeting. “The most seriously implicated was Absa but she did not afford the bank the same privilege despite a request for a meeting.” The report further ordered that the Reserve Bank’s constitutional mandate be changed but this remedial action has already been set aside by the court. The court is still in session. Advocate Carol Steinberg, also representing Absa, is expected to make submissions on the unlawfulness of the remedial action.  -TNA Reporter
