In a bid to alleviate the scourge of unemployed youths in Mpumalanga, provincial government has pledged to improve the levels of unemployment in the province.Premier David Mabuza has committed to changing the reality of a cynical picture of an improved Mpumalanga due to a lack of gainful employment, and abject poverty with glaring inequalities.Mabuza delivered his state of the province address last week in Nelspruit where he highlighted the progress and setbacks in the province.Mpumalanga s unemployed youth currently constitutes 71.9% of the country s total unemployed population.This, he said, leads to agitated youth that has energy and optimism but are trapped in the shackles of unemployment and easily fall prey to the social ills that go hand in hand with deprivation.A contribution by Sasol towards the economy of the province was hailed as a significant investment set to stimulate and highly impact enterprise development and job creation in Mpumalanga. Sasol invested R6bn in the construction of Fine Ash Dam 6 a project that will span more than three decades.The project is already employing 481 people and has subcontracted 102 small businesses owned by local people at its prefirst phase stage. Sasol s contribution also extends to a partnership with the provincial government to support initiatives such as building clinics, community centres and schools.The company also agreed to absorb some learners who have been completing artisanships in Secunda. The premier condemned the tragic incident at Lily Mine that led to substantial job losses leaving thousands of workers and their dependants destitute.The Minister of Mineral Resources Mosebenzi Zwane and Mabuza last week visited the mine, finding workers living in dehumanising conditions .Mabuza vowed to find innovative ways to limit negative consequences brought on by the tragedy and also finding a way to revive the mine. The closure of several mines leading to mass retrenchments is a major concern in Mpumalanga as mining contributes 25.9% of the GDP, employing 53000 people.Mabuza called for a bold approach to the mining sector.The provincial government has commissioned the Mpumalanga Economic Growth Activity to explore the viability of utilising its current mining holdings as a base from which to build a diversified state- owned mining company.The premier said that the province could no longer hold on to mining assets lying idle and are unproductive when unemployment is at its peak.THELMA NGOMAthelman@thenewage.co.za
