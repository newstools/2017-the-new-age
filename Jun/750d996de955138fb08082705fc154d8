HELEN Zille is to face a DA disciplinary hearing, charged with bringing the political party she once led into disrepute in Cape Town on Friday. The Western Cape Premier will appear in front of a three-person panel headed by lawyer Jurie Moolman in connection with seemingly pro-colonialism tweets she tweeted after returning from Singapore in March.Friday s appearance is not the only one of Zille s troubles with the DA. She has until today to inform and convince the DA federal executive council why she should not be suspended. Party leader Mmusi Maimane announced her suspension at the weekend, but Zille pointed out a procedural flaw which had denied her the opportunity to make representations before her suspension.The DA subsequently gave her 72 hours to make her case why she should not be suspended. Acting ANC leader in the province Khaya Magaxa also accused the DA of not knowing how to deal with the stubborn Zille and called for her resignation. He said: Zille s earlier Twitter rants on the virtues of certain apartheid and racial colonialism were the last straw. It did not only bring disrepute to her party, but also embarrassed her high office as first citizen of the province and the Western Cape legislature. She is not good enough for the DA and most certainly not good enough for the Western Cape. She is past her sell-by date. It is time to pack up and call it a day, Zille. Meanwhile, the DA investigation into Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille s alleged role in the leaking of party documents to the news media is nearing completion, DA federal legal commission head Glynnis Breytenbach has confirmed.news@thenewage.co.za-Dennis Cruywagen
