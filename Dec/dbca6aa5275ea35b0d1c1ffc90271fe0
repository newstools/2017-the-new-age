Delegates at the ANC national elective conference on Sunday adopted the programme and the conference will continue as scheduled, the party’s Deputy General Secretary Jessie Duarte said. Duarte said the 35 branches from the North West and the two Provincial Executive Committees (PEC) from KwaZulu-Natal and the Free State would not be allowed to participate in the voting. “We’re going to plenary now, it’s a closed session. We are going to be dealing with the proposed constitutional amendments and the extension of the top six,” Duarte said. This comes after a rigorous process by the party to deal with bogus delegates and those affected by the court from participating in the voting process of electing new leadership. On Saturday, the conference was delayed by allegations that there were bogus delegates at the conference. Duarte also revealed that voting would take place later on Sunday, adding that the results would be released on Monday. She said the party did not want to rush the voting process. Judging by Saturday’s hostile environment at the conference, the closed session will probably be a heated one. Meanwhile, it has been alleged that head of organising Fikile Mbalula and Nomvula Mokyane were registering bogus delegates but Mbalula has since dispelled the allegations. -Sipho Jack
