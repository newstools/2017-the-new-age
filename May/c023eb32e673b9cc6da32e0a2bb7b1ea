The transport sector holds massive potential for job creation and entrepreneurship opportunities, Free State Premier Ace Magashule said today.This he said in light of the decision by the provincial government to partner with the Transport Education Training Authority (Teta) to host a transport expo at the Parys Aerodrome on Saturday.The expo aims to expose high school pupils to explore employment opportunities in the transport sector that includes rail, aviation, freight handling, maritime and green transport.Teta chief executive officer Maphefo Anno-Frempong is to launch the initiative, arguing that there are many pupils in the province who are not aware of these opportunities .&#8220;We are excited to launch this initiative as most learners are not aware of the diverse employment opportunities in the field of transportation. We have ensured that we attract a varied mix of exhibitors in order to afford learners a bird s eye view of the range of career options available in the sector, Frempong added.Magashule said the province has a pool of talented pupils with skills and interest.&#8220;Our province was the best performer in the 2016 matric results. We are committed to nurturing this talent by investing in skills development programmes and career opportunity, Magashule said.-Sipho Jack
