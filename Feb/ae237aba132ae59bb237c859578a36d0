It was four years ago, but South African tennis fans have certainly not forgotten how Slovenia denied them an opportunity to make it into the Davis Cup s world group.Back in 2013, Slovenia hosted and defeated South Africa 4-1 in their Euro/ Africa Group 1 tie and the defeat sent SA into a relegation battle against Russia.It s part of history now that SA team lost 5-0 to Russia and was relegated to the Euro/Africa Group 2, where they are currently campaigning.In April, South Africa will host Slovenia in a fight to upgrade to Group 1 and then it s on to the world group.Slovenia secured themselves a trip to SA after beating Monaco 3-2 in the first round of the Euro/Africa Group 2 tie at the weekend.SA claimed a 4-1 victory over Estonia at the Irene Country Club and without a doubt, the South Africans will have revenge on their mind when they meet Slovenia.SA Davis Cup team captain Marcos Ondruska was highly impressed by his team, made up of Ruan Roelofse, who was in the team that lost to Slovenia four years ago, as well as with RavenKlaasen, Lloyd Harris and Nik Scholtz.Ondruska said the players had a good offseason and that they were going to have an amazing time this year and help the country achieve its goal. The goal is to go to Euro/Africa Group 1 and then to the world group.But we can only take it one step at a time, Ondruska said. From what I have seen the guys have put in an incredible offseason, they have been doing the right work, running hard and building up their bodies. That means they are going to be better players this year. Star performer of the team, Klaasen, who is ranked 13 in the world, believes playing at home tends to work in their favour.South Africa have beaten Slovenia before, in 2012, when they hosted the side in Soweto. When we play in South Africa we are a formidable unit because we play in conditions that we are used to. What we have to do is try to figure out is how to win more matches when we are playing abroad, Klaasen said. In most sports, you see that when people play at home in front of their own fans they perform much better than when away. SITHEMBISO DINDI sithembisod@thenewage.co.za
