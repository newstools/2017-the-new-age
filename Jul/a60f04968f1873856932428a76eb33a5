Minister of Finance Malusi Gigaba must be judged on his actions and not by perceptions created out of hearsay and innuendo. We should not lose sight of the fact that we need to address the issues the ratings agencies raise, first and foremost for the good of our country and to advance our national development, Gigaba said last month. We need to want to do the right things for our economy and our society, not just because credit ratings agencies are watching. Obviously these developments are not what we would have hoped, however it is critical that we are not despondent at this time. Whatever Gigaba s political future holds, he is right about one thing, the need to take cognizance of our development goals and future as a developmental state and how the National Development Plan (NDP) is key to unlocking the economic gridlock. The NDP set our nation the task of driving inclusive growth and economic transformation as two necessary, mutually reinforcing and overarching objectives which enable us to resolve our national challenges.Nowhere in the NDP does it say it would be easy.:Achieving Vision 2030 requires all of us to find common cause and ask ourselves how we can contribute as the government, as business, as labour, as civil society to inclusive growth and economic transformation. Let us remain optimistic about the possibilities of South Africa, and work together to realize a better future for all, Gigaba said.The NDP is regarded by the government as one of the key drivers of change. And as Gigaba pointed out, it is not going to be an easy journey, but a necessary one.The NDP is quite unambiguous in its ambition when it says: The single most important investment any country can make is in its people. This is the cornerstone underpinning the vision of the NDP which aims to better the lives of most South Africans, but especially the poor.Some of this will have to be amended given the recent ratings downgrades and the economy grappling with a technical recession.But the NDP s principles in terms of desired outcomes remains sound.South Africa has come a long way since 1994 in upskilling its labour force. In 1994 there were 1.8 million skilled workers, 4.2 million semiskilled workers and 2.9 million low-skilled workers.By 2014, 20 years later, the number of skilled workers increased to 3.8 million (a 108% increase), the number of semiskilled workers increased to 7 million (66%) and the number of low-skilled workers to 4.3 million (an increase of 49%).Skilled workers are classified as managers, professionals, technicians; semi-skilled as clerks, sales and service personnel, skilled agriculture personnel, craft personnel and machine operators; while low-skilled workers are classed as elementary and domestic workers.Since 1994, the number of skilled professionals increased from 21% to 25%, while the number of semiskilled professionals were down 1% to 46% and the low-skilled category of workers decreased by 3% to 29%.Significantly, the number of workers in the labour force in terms of demographics showed the highest growth was black Africans, at 95%.The proportion of black African workers in the work force has also increased between 1994 and 2014 from 63% to 73%.The numbers across population groups show that the proportion of black African, coloured and Indian workers in the skilled workforce increased.While these figures make for encouraging reading, much more needs to be done to turn around the 25% or so unemployment rate.Weak economic growth since the 2008 recession supports the NDP s findings that a broad programme of reform needs to be implemented, with skills development as one of its key features .South Africa has set itself the goals of eradicating poverty, reducing inequality and growing the economy by an average of 5.4% and drastically reducing joblessness to 6% by 2030.Challenges remain and one of them is in the education system.The school and post-school system is not well designed to meet the skills and development needs of a fast-paced world led by innovation.The NDP is therefore unambiguous in its stated goals for education in South Africa (to) ensure that skilled, technical, professional and managerial posts better reflect the country s racial, gender and disability make-up .The 2016 World Economic Forum held in Davos, explored the theme of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and presented challenges and opportunities for the country s long-range economic planning.The use of technology and innovation has to looked at and implemented to deal with inequality, poverty and joblessness.So while the NDP remained the blueprint for dealing with economic growth, the impact and speed at which technologies were moving would possibly force a rethink of how the NDP needed to be implemented in terms of equipping South Africans to be able to participate in the economy. The knowledge economy does require new ways of thinking, teaching, learning, working and living.Therefore capacity building is crucial and developing South Africa s human resource capacity is an integral part of government policies to address inequalities and to further grow the economy.There are around 180000 people employed in the ICT sector, with around 15000 or so software developers. There are also nearly 8000 companies in the ICT sector in South Africa, with most employing 50 people or fewer.Education, training and innovation have been targeted by the government as key priorities leading up to 2030, all with a view of eliminating poverty, reducing inequality and to help the economic growth of the country.For example, the future classroom will need educators to be equipped with the necessary ICT skills so that they are able to use e-education platforms.Pupils will benefit from an e-teaching and learning environment which will stand them in good stead in the technology-driven marketplace of the 21st century.The government s focus is on developing capacity and skills amongst South Africans and in, especially the 15 to 34 year age group, which at 70.9% accounts for the highest portion of unemployed South Africans.The NDP aims to push through processes that will create an e-literate society by 2030 which it sees as a catalyst for raising employment through faster economic growth, improving the quality of education, skills development and innovation and building the capacity of the state to play a developmental and transformative role.Greater access to technology will open greater possibilities for all South Africans. And with more South Africans accessing smartphone technology, online access is set to increase which will be a catalyst for growth on all fronts.But to promote growth through innovation and technology, a coordinated road map is needed and a fully integrated and coordinated framework is needed, one which is aligned to the key priorities of the NDP and the national skills plan which will set South Africa on a meaningful path to upskilling millions more.Tokozile Xasa is the Minister of Tourism and NEC member of the ANC Women s League
