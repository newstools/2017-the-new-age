THE Young Communist League of South Africa (YCLSA) in the province said this week that it would fight all elements in the province who were using the name of their party to cause factionalism.Spokesperson Michia Moncho said some people were using the name and brand of the league to push agendas aimed at dividing the party. We, as the YCLSA, note with disgust and dismay the proscribed and unauthorised use of its name and symbols, as well as that of the SACP for factional purposes, she said. Moncho said anti-working class members were using the YCLSA s administrative powers to capture the movement. We must fight corruption and break ranks with corrupt leaders. We must defeat factionalism and the constitutional hijacking and capturing of the movement by anti-working class heroes, who unashamedly, if ironically, we put in power. The working class must never lower its guard. It must protect its long-term interests and fight resolutely to secure its immediate aims. This cannot be entrusted to individuals. It is the task of the class and its organised detachments. On the other hand, we must equally uproot patronage and the financialisation of internal processes used to hijack structures. This means that we must resolutely fight the kingpins of corruption, deal with their runners decisively, pursue those who run away, stash corrupt proceeds in the public sector, the private sector and inside our movements. This we must do indiscriminately, without regard for rank and position if we are interested in the success of our national democratic transformation and a prosperous South Africa. Moncho said the league wanted to clarify the role of the YCLSA for the upcoming provincial conference and confirm that they are the most united alliance. She said the YCLSA was concerned about factions as the conference approaches .NOMUSA MVUBU
