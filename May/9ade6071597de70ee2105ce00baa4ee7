Minister of Police Fikile Mbalula was the victim of a prank call when he visited the South African Police Service (SAPS) 10111 Call Centre in Midrand yesterday. Mbalula made an unannounced visit, following complaints received from the public and interacted with the call centre agents. He was given an opportunity to receive calls from the public and spoke with a woman who said she was looking for her friend called Sonti. Mbalula told her that the call centre is an important tool in the fight against crime and should never be used for fun. “My visit here has been very important. I receive complaints from the public about the SAPS call centres and I came here to interact with the management and the call agents about ways to improve the way we communicate with the public,” Mbalula said. “I had the pleasure of communicating with our SAPS officers on the ground. “I appreciated that. I also took calls from the public. I will stress again that members of the public must guard against the abuse of the emergency phone facility. “I promise on my part we will work harder to improve the centre’s response.” Mbalula plans to visit more police stations and all SAPS centres. “Police stations, call centres and all other SAPS work places must expect me at any time.” Mbalula was connected to all SAPS vehicles from the call centre and used the opportunity to thank SAPS officers for their hard work in keeping the country safe. He urged the police officers to enforce law and order in communities and not to take bribes. “To all those on duty, I want to say you are doing a great job in protecting our country. I know you are doing that at a great cost of lives and the great sacrifice of a job that is thankless, because no one says well done to you. “We, who are your leaders, would like to encourage you to keep doing a great job for the people, remember our motto is to protect and serve, do not take bribes and be corrupt.
