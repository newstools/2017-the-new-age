To women, on behalf of all men of South Africa, whether or not they agree with me, we apologise , said Siya Jentile, one of the organisers of the march. Another, Khaya Sibeko told The New Age he supports the march because he is a son and he has a grandmother who is not safe because of the abuse and rape of women in our country.#NotInMyName @ANN7tv @The_New_Age #mensmarch pic.twitter.com/6bQW8tNOdN&mdash; Kgothatso Phatladira (@Kgphatlas) May 20, 2017 &#8220;Everything that has been happening is not good.Our sisters are being murdered every day.
