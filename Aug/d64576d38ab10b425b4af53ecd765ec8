The SAA has on Saturday advised all they are customers that flights from Johannesburg and Zimbabwe have been affected by the restriction imposed by the Zimbabwean authorities on operations.The SAA flight was grounded early on Saturday morning. The flight SA025 was supposed to leave Harare in the morning.The national carrier said the decision to impose the restriction emanates from the requirement from Zimbabwean authorities of a Foreign Operators Permit (FOP) from the airline to continue to operate in that country. SAA was notified of the decision on Saturday morning and flight SA025 from Harare to Johannesburg could not operate at 07h00. A022 which was scheduled to depart at 10h45 from Johannesburg to Harare has also been canceled, the carrier said in a statement.SAA assured its passengers that effort will be made to return the flights to normal and that recovery plans have been made.Report suggests that the grounding of SAA flights could be a retaliation of the Zimbabwean authorities, following their flight being grounded last night.The Zimbabwe aircraft was last night grounded due to noncompliance with South African civil aviation regulations. This evening, i.e. on Friday, 18 August 2017, one of the aircraft inspected was a Boeing 767- 200 operated by Air Zimbabwe. The ramp inspection conducted by the SACAA personnel discovered that this operator was not compliant with both international civil aviation standards, and Part 129 of the South African civil aviation regulations, a statement from SACAA read.The SAA said it was still monitoring the situation and will provide updates on a regular basis and when there are developments.-ANN7 Reporter
