Italy&#8217;s centre-right parties hammered their centre-left rivals in mayoral elections, official results showed on Monday, a win that is likely to put pressure on the ruling Democratic Party (PD) ahead of a national vote due in less than a year.An alliance of Silvio Berlusconi&#8217;s Forza Italia party and the anti-immigrant Northern League won 55 percent of the votes in the northern port city of Genoa, traditionally left-wing stronghold, where the right will govern for the first time in more than five decades.PD leader Matteo Renzi, who has been seeking to make a comeback since stepping down as prime minister in December, was the clear loser in Sunday&#8217;s vote, though polls show his party is still one of Italy&#8217;s most popular nationally.&#8220;It could have gone better,&#8221; Renzi said in an early-morning Facebook post. &#8220;The overall result isn&#8217;t great.&#8221;-Reuters
