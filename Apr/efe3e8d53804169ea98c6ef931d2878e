Spur has remorseful apologised about the incident that was widely publicised at Texamo Spur in the Glen Shopping Centre in Johannesburg.After a month the incident took place, the Spur group has issued an apology on Freedom Day.Even though Spur earlier reported that an aggressive confrontation between a white man and a black woman at one of its restaurants was not a racist incident but rather an act of anger.Spur CEO Pierre van Tonder says the spur group would like to apologise unreservedly to the South African public.&#8220;Our response fell short of our own high standards. We should have done better. We expect it from ourselves to do better and we believe that the South African public deserve better.&#8221;In the statement van Tonder said; &#8220;It was an intensive period of self-reflection for everyone at Spur and with the wisdom of hindsight, we have decided to embark on a course of action to address the shortcomings in our response.&#8221;The group also asked Prof. Elmien du Plessis of the Faculty of Law at North-West University (NWU) to convene a panel and draft guidelines for an in-depth investigation into all relevant aspects of the incident on 19 March 2017 and how it was handled. The panel will be completely independent and have full access to all facts and footage surrounding the event. The team will make recommendations to Spur on actions that should be taken to rectify the shortcomings in our response and improve our reaction to similar incidents in future.&#8220;We have already embarked on a national programme to increase the child-minder to child ratio in our Play Canyons during busy periods. We have also launched a formal re-education drive that will refresh and enhance the procedures and skills of our minders,&#8221; said van Tonder.TNA Reporter
