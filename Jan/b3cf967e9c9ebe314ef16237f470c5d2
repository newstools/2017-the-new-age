Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela has on Monday endorsed the call for a female president. I would love to have a female president, but not a female who is a proxy said Madonsela.Madonsela made the remarks while addressing the Cape Town Press Club reflecting on her seven year tenure as Public Protector.Recently the African National Congress Women&#8217;s League announced that it would be backing Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to take over as ANC president when the party goes to its elective conference in December. The ANC Youth league has also made calls for a women President.Madonsela told the Press Club that she herself did not hold any political ambitions or desire to ascend to the highest offices in the land.&#8221; I&#8217;m neither qualified to be president nor interested. South Africa deserves a good President. The President we elect must ensure a united South Africa, growth and redistribution.&#8221; said Madonsela.Madonsela refused to comment on whether the preliminary report into alleged Apartheid era looting is same as the one she left when she vacated office adding that &#8220;history will tell the truth about what I concluded and what is now on the table.&#8221;&#8221; When I left we had concluded the provisional report, it was just an administrative error that prevented me from singing that report. &#8221; said Madonsela.She said that the Absa investigation had taken a long time to conclude because she investigated it herself where she faced legal challenges because of secrecy clauses of the Reserve Bank.&#8220;The Absa matter was bought to me in 2011 by advocate Paul Hoffman. However the initiator of the Absa CIEX investigation is Michael Oatley, a former MI-6 spy.&#8221; said Madonsela.&#8221; The Ciex report was about a lot more than Absa. It was about apartheid era looting.&#8221;continued Madonsela.Meanwhile the former Public Protector said that a lot of progress had been made since the youth took up the challenge for social justice in the guise of the Fees Must Fall movement.&#8220;People have been so dis-empowered they may engage in methods of wanting to be heard that are not always acceptable or even advantages to them. &#8221; said Madonsela.&#8221; What we must do as members of the public is not condemn the cause. We must separate some of the behaviour from the cause. Because the cause behind the Fees Must Fall movement is real. &#8220;continued Madonsela.Madonsela also reiterated calls she had previously made that the Office of the Public Protector be better resourced.&#8221; The Public Protectors office needs R200 million and double the number of investigators to become a more effective ombud&#8221; said Madonsela.-TNA Reporter
