Cosatu says it is happy with the Lily Vantage Gold Mine s gesture of fulfilling its promise to pay R200 000 to the families of the miners trapped underground. The federation is glad to see that the families of missing miners (Pretty Mabuza, Solomon Nyarenda and Yvonne Mnisi), who are still trapped underground at Lily Vantage Gold Mine in Mpumalanga since the 15th of February 2016 have been paid the R200 000 that was promised to them, Cosatu said in a statement.Last year in February a shaft at the mine in Barberton, Mpumalanga, collapsed trapping the three. Despite extensive attempts to bring the deceased to the surface the bodies have never been recovered.The federation also welcomed the payment of R10 000 to each of the 75 injured miners. The injured miners were promised R50 000 and the Cosatu has itself in organising fundraising to assist workers in raising an additional R 40 000. This effort comes even though NUM was not the recognised union on the mine. Cosatu remains adamant that any company that takes over operations at Lily Mine needs to prioritise the repatriation of the bodies of the trapped miners first. We also want to see the continuation of an investigation that will help determine the cause of the accident and we demand that those found responsible should be held accountable, statement read.The federation also urged workers to start implementing the five-point pledge plan, which is aimed at achieving zero harm in mining fatalities.-Sipho Jack
