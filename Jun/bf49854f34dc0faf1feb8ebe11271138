Ben Ngubane s sudden and unexpected resignation as Eskom board chairperson has perplexed the ANC in Parliament.In a statement yesterday, the ANC Parliamentary Study Group on Public Enterprises also called his move suspect. Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown announced Ngubane s resignation on Monday night.The Study Group reacted by saying it was perplexed. We view this resignation as an attempt to avoid being held accountable for his role in recent events at Eskom, Study Group chairperson Zukiswa Rantho said.She said as chairperson of the board, Ngubane was central in its processes, which led to the now rescinded reappointment of Brian Molefe at Eskom. Parliament s Public Enterprises Portfolio Committee had also presented a number of questions to the Eskom board that it had yet to respond to. The timing and rationale of this resignation is therefore surprising and suspect, Rantho said. It cannot be correct that board members choose to resign when they are to be held accountable for their actions and decisions in our state-owned enterprises. This sudden resignation must therefore be followed by an investigation into allegations of misconduct and corruption at Eskom. The DA said in a statement that it found the clandestine hour of Ngubane s resignation announcement to be highly suspicious . Ngubane s resignation will not exonerate him from liability for the breakdown of the governance at the power utility and the DA will use the Parliamentary Inquiry into Eskom, set to commence next Wednesday, to hold Ngubane to account, the DA said.TNA REPORTERnews@thenewage.co.za
