BRIAN Molefe refuses to take the rescinding of his Eskom recall quietly and is hauling both Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown and the Eskom board to the Labour Court.Molefe could not be reached on his phone for comment yesterday. Brown s spokesperson Colin Cruywagen would only confirm that Molefe had served papers on the Minister and Eskom.Brown formed part of an interministerial committee briefing in Parliament last week, where it was announced that the committee had advised the Public Enterprises Minister on what steps to take.Brown said she had instructed the Eskom board to rescind its decision to reinstate Molefe as Eskom CEO, a post he had quit last November, insisting at the time that he was leaving in the public interest and that he wanted to clear his name.Eskom later claimed he had either resigned or taken early retirement or unpaid leave. Eskom also announced it would give him a R30m pension payout, which sparked a public outcry. Brown refused to sanction this payment.Last week, in the same week that Molefe attended a parliamentary portfolio committee as Eskom CEO, Brown instructed the Eskom board to rescind its decision to reinstate Molefe to his former position as Eskom CEO.Brown had also announced that she had asked the Eskom board for the names of two executives, from which she would appoint one as acting CEO.Following her instruction, Eskom announced on Friday that Molefe was no longer the CEO and he would also discontinue to serve as a director on the board. In giving effect to and on the basis of the Minister s directive contained in the letter dated May 31, 2017 it was resolved that the resolution of the board of directors taken on May 2, 2017 is rescinded, Eskom said.The Eskom board said it was also resolved that the reinstatement agreement concluded between Molefe and Eskom on May 11 be rescinded. However, Molefe has turned to the Labour Court and served papers on both Brown and Eskom.DENNIS CRUYWAGENnews@thenewage.co.za
