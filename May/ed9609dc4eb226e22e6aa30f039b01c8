Unhappy crowds waited in a tent in Vuwani for PresIdent Jacob Zuma to address them, but he did not attend that particular public meeting because the group was not &#8220;representative&#8221; of the broader community.The meeting ended in chaos but the Presidency issued a statement saying that he had visited the area following a meeting with His Majesty King Toni Mphephu Ramabulana of Vha-Venda last week. He also met church leaders, traditional leaders, business, youth and the pro-Makhado group.&#8220;The meeting accepted His Majesty&#8217;s proposal that the Vhembe District Municipality should provide services to the people of Vuwani while a solution on the demarcation issue is being sought,&#8221; the statement read.&#8220;It was further decided that relevant national and provincial government departments should provide support to the district municipality to carry out this new mandate.&#8221;The statement was clear that the meeting did not mean that the new municipality had been disestablished. The area has seen unprecedented protests since the new municipality was established. Schools have been burnt down and schooling disrupted in the area due to the ongoing conflicts. &#8220;President Zuma, His Majesty the King and all leaders present at the meeting called upon all community members in Vuwani to work to bring about normalcy in the community. Learners and educators, in particular, were urged to go back to school.&#8221;President Zuma will go back to the district to address all community members, those who are against the newly established municipality and those who are for. After assessing the situation today, a conclusion was reached that the community meeting was not representative of the whole community affected by the establishment of the new municipality. It was mostly composed by those who oppose the new municipality,&#8221; the statement read. The King addressed the gathering which was attended by among others Cooperative Affairs Governance Minister Des Van Rooyen. The crowds were extremely unhappy because of the long wait for Zuma whom they were anxious to address.&#8211; ANN7 reporter
