A dramatic 95th-minute equaliser from Morocco against Cameroon (1-1) in the Islamic Solidarity Games football tournament in Baku on Thursday left both sides with some regrets.&#8220;I am not happy with the result, but I am satisfied with the determination the players showed to pull back level. They were resolute and showed a lot of willpower to get that goal&#8221;, Morocco coach Jamal Sellami told AFP-Services.With four points, the north Africans moved one step closer to a place in the semi-finals ahead of the clash between Saudi Arabia and hosts Azerbaijan later in the day.&#8220;We wanted a win to guarantee qualification. Now we have to wait for the result of the other game and maybe we&#8217;ll be forced to win against the hosts on the final day. That&#8217;s never a good thing&#8221;, added the former midfielder.Yassine El Houasli, on the other hand, prefered focusing on the positive.&#8220;We had a good game. Sure, it&#8217;s disappointing to concede a goal but we stayed focused for he whole 90 minutes and managed to pull back. And we have one match left&#8221;, the goalkeeper said.Cameroon were also disappointed with the result having come so close to victory.&#8220;We&#8217;re frustrated and sad. We worked hard to get those three points. It&#8217;s never easy when you&#8217;re down one man (after the sending off of Yves Daniel Kamy Ntankeu on the 58th minute)&#8221;, said captain Frank Bagnack.&#8220;It&#8217;s hard. We tried to hold them off and probably deserved more&#8221;, said the classy defender, on loan from Nantes at Real Zaragoza.&#8221;We felt like we could have kept the score. We&#8217;ll learn from that but we&#8217;re really downhearted by that last-minute goal&#8221;, said assistant coach Emmanuel Maboang.Monday&#8217;s final action in the group stages sees Cameroon face Saudi Arabia while Azerbaijan host Morocco.-AFP
