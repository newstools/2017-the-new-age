Fitch Ratings has affirmed both of Denel s national long-term rating and national short-term rating as positive.The outlook for both ratings remains stable, with the national long-term rating at AAA (zaf) while the National ShortTerm Rating is at F1+ (zaf). Acting group CE Zwelakhe Ntshepe welcomed Fitch s decision to affirm both ratings of the state-owned defence and technology company. Fitch notes that the decision to affirm the ratings reflects the continuing strong links between Denel and the state mainly driven by the government s irrevocable and unconditional guarantee for R1.85bn of the company s R3bn domestic medium-term notes.This guarantee expires on September 30 and Fitch has further noted that a decision not to extend this guarantee would result in a multi-notch downgrade for Denel s ratings. The Fitch Ratings report notes that Denel continues to deliver a strong topline performance. Its key land system projects are ramping up from the design to the production stage and this portfolio of the group was further strengthened with the acquisition of Denel Vehicle Systems.It expects a short-term decline in revenues and profitability during the past financial year which can mostly be attributed to foreign exchange factors and delays on major contracts. In the medium term, Denel s performance will be affected by the group s restructuring plans and revenues will be suppressed by the future repositioning of divisions and products.-TNA Reporter|business@thenewage.co.za
