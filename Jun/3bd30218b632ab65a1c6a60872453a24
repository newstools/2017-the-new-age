A driver affiliated to the Witwatersrand African taxi Association (Wata) was stabbed to death while a colleague is fighting for his life at an intensive care unit (ICU) at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital following a serious stab wound.Wata spokesperson George Maphalala said the senseless killing of their member, and the serious stabbing of another member, was related to taxi conflict dogging the associations. We know who is responsible for these unfortunate incidents that have led to the death of our member and serious injury to one of our own. We also know that this is related to the recent taxi strike, Maphalala said.The two drivers were stabbed in Dube, Soweto, resulting from palpable tension between Wata and the rival association, Nanduwe Taxi Association.&#8220;We have suspended all services until the situation can be resolved it&#8217;s too dangerous for us to operate, Maphalala said.He said government officials were trying to broker peace between the warring associations. The government is bringing the two associations together. We will meet and hopefully find a way forward, he added.Late yesterday taxis were damaged as drivers from the two rival associations battled over routes.Passengers were yet left stranded today as they had no mode of transport, due to the strike.-TNA Reporter
