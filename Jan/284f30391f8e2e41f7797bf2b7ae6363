Fifty-five young people in Phalaborwa have recently been given a lifeline in the form of jobs to install electrical fire suppression systems for Palabora Mining Company (MPC) s Lift 11 underground shaft, thanks to two black owned companies Global Mining Projects (GMP) based locally and Enzani Technologies from Gauteng.The 50 jobs were ring-fenced for skilled and semiskilled youths with Grade 12 certificates from within the Greater Ba-Phalaborwa municipality.GMP owner Freddy Ntsenana said the jobs created through partnership with Enzani Technologies should encourage other companies to adopt the same model to enable the transfer of skills and the creation of sustainable jobs in mining towns and also the creation of hope beyond mining. There is capacity in locals irrespective of colour because now everybody in business understands that being exceptional is not a sign of supremacy but a refusal of mediocrity, said Ntsenana born and bred in Phalaborwa.Ntsenana introduced himself to the world of mining at a young age, while in Grade 10 at Vuxeni High School in Phalaborwa.A pupil who was fond of mathematics and science, he designed underground mining of the future a project that won him a prize at the young scientists expo.The winning project prompted PMC to offer him a bursary after passing Grade 12 to study mining engineering at the University of Johannesburg. On completion he became a miner at PMC before going to the US to work for another mining company.He established his GMP in 2012 and today is among contractors of PMC. I always believed that if African minerals were to be shared equally with black people, as enshrined in the Mineral Petroleum and Resources Development Act, then somebody needs to start a black-owned company that will contribute to the core business of the mining industry, Ntsenana said.PMC external affairs and communications manager Lydia Radebe said the company was contributing to the National Development Plan prescripts of creating black industrialists thus contributing to the development of a town beyond the life of the mine.MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
