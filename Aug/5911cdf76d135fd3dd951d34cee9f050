The rape of a student at the University of Fort Hare Alice campus recently angered many individuals and organisations.The university spokesperson, Khotso Moabi, said they were aware of the incident and had handed it over to the police for investigation.The Democratic Alliance Student Organisation (Daso) condemned the incident.Daso constituency leader Hlomela Bucwa said it was unfortunate that the incident had taken place at a time when millions of South Africans were calling for safer communities and the protection of women and children. All of us must fiercely combat the scourge of rape and femicide in our society, Bucwa said.The 20-year-old student was repeatedly raped by three unknown men who then forced her to take a shower to get rid of incriminating evidence.The men initially acted as if they were saving her from a knife-wielding attacker in Alice at the weekend. The victim was walking to her residence after attending the inter-varsity tournament on the campus.The gang rape comes after Rhodes University pulled out of the annual two-day sporting event, citing safety concerns for their students.In recent years, the inter-varsity tournament has descended into lawlessness, with students being raped and others being killed while on their way from attending the after party.Bucwa said victims of rape and sexual assault often did not speak up because the crime was either committed by someone they knew or they lacked faith in the justice system. This is concerning as the isolation and silence around these crimes is often more damaging than the crime itself. We call on the university and the SAPS to act immediately to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice, Bucwa said.He said Daso would do everything in its power to promote and guarantee the safety of women on campuses by advocating for safer campuses. We are committed to making sure well-trained security personnel are visible on campuses and installing of CCTV surveillance across all campuses. We are also dedicated to enforcing stricter regulations on alcohol and drug consumption and also the promotion of responsible drinking, Bucwa said.He said in a few days, they would engage with the university s management to ensure that the victim received all the necessary support and counseling she needed.-TNA Reporter
