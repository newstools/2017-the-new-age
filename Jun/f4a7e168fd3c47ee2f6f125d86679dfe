Despite the apparent power struggle between herself and the DA leader Mmusi Maimane she holds him in great regard, Western Cape Premier Helen Zille said today. She made the comments on the sidelines of the first day of her disciplinary hearing in Cape Town where she faces charges of bringing the DA into disrepute. “I’ve had a very high regard for him since the day I met him. I think he is the kind of person that I could look up to very strongly as a president of South Africa. “We often disagree with each other and we still do disagree but that does not take away from respect. If people come up with arguments that convince me, I will change my position. I’m not wedded to being right,” Zille said. A public face off between Zille and Maimane kicked into gear after Maimane announced her suspension at the weekend, but Zille pointed out a procedural flaw which had denied her the opportunity to make representations. However, Zille was later slapped with immediate suspension on Wednesday. At a media conference in Braamfontein, leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Julius Malema accused Zille of undermining Maimane’s leadership. “Those whites undermine Mmusi. Zille is prepared to collapse this project called the DA because of her ego,” he said. “We voted to remove the ANC not to sustain white supremacy and arrogance. We are protecting Mmusi here because he is black,” Malema said. Former DA founder and leader Tony Leon, in an interview with news channel ANN7, warned that if Maimane failed to deal decisively with Zille, his authority in leading a historically white political party, aiming to swell its ranks with black voters, would be undermined. “How it plays out will be determinative of Mmusi Maimane’s future leadership. If he does not prevail in this matter, he won’t be an effective leader going forward,” Leon said.  -TNA Reporter
