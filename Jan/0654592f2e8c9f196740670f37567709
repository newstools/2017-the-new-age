Member of the Eastern Cape Legislature Committee Phumelele Ndamase criticised the central procurement process of the Department of Education and said it was abnormal.Phumelele Ndamase said that the committee cannot accept excuses made by the department. We do not accept any excuses being made by the department,this issue of textbooks and stationery has not been handled well this year and we are going to make a finding out of this, said Ndamase.Ndamase&#8217;s comments comes after the committee visited schools within the Port Elizabeth area in aim to assess the schools readiness for the 2017 school calender year and check problems that are faced by the schools.The challenges being faced by the schools included gang violence and shootings, drug alcohol abuse unfilled vacant funded posts.The abuse of sick leave by teachers unsolved cases at schools, resulting to Principals going on incapacity leave for more than 6 months and Non-delivery of Learner Teacher Support material (LTSM) are among other problems.Provincial Chief Education Specialist, George Lukwe accept that the department failed to deliver LTSM to schools on time and blamed the distributors for the delay. This is an unfortunate situation that schools are made to wait this long. We will try and see if we can take out some schools from the central procurement as it delays them said Lukwe.Meanwhile SAPS in Nelson Mandela Bay will randomly patrol schools following two burglaries and a robbery at Walmer schools this week.This comes only a day after Harvest Christian School was robbed by three gunmen on Wednesday.Chairperson Ndlangisa-Makaula promised that the Committee would follow up with MEC for Safety &amp; Liaison, Weziwe Tikana about police patrols and visibility around the schools to curb the drug and gang problem. If the Department can sort out all these problems, we can stop being number last on grade 12 results year-in-year-out. Education is a collective responsibility of all, not just the Department of Education the Chairperson said.TNA Reporter&nbsp;
