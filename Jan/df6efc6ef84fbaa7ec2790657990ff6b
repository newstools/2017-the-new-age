President-elect Donald Trump wants health &#8220;insurance for everybody,&#8221; he told The Washington Post, no small feat in a country where millions are uninsured.The Republican has long lashed out at President Barack Obama&#8217;s signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act, campaigning on a pledge to repeal and replace it.But the billionaire developer had never said precisely with what.Now, however, he told the Post by phone late Saturday that he wants &#8220;insurance for everybody&#8221; while requiring drug companies to negotiate directly with the government on prices in Medicare and Medicaid, the government plans mostly for the elderly and low-income Americans, respectively.&#8220;They&#8217;re politically protected. But not anymore,&#8221; Trump was quoted as saying of big pharmaceutical companies.The White House touts the ACA &#8212; nicknamed Obamacare &#8212; as a success, saying more than 20 million Americans have gained health insurance through the law.The Affordable Care Act forbids insurance companies from denying health care due to pre-existing conditions, abolishes lifetime caps on care, and allows children to stay on their parents&#8217; plans until age 26, three provisions that have proved popular nationwide.Democrats warn that scrapping the law could force millions of Americans to lose their coverage.Undoing Obamacare will be a monumental task. Although the new Republican leadership in Congress has begun moving quickly to deprive the ACA of funding, it has also stressed it does not want to &#8220;pull the rug out from anyone&#8221; who might lose coverage if there is no replacement plan on offer.And there is debate among Republicans about how &#8212; and how fast &#8212; to proceed without a credible replacement ready to roll out.Without revealing much more than a pledge of &#8220;lower numbers, much lower deductibles,&#8221; Trump said a proposed deal was now agreed.&#8220;It&#8217;s very much formulated down to the final strokes. We haven&#8217;t put it in quite yet, but we&#8217;re going to be doing it soon,&#8221; he said.&#8220;We&#8217;re going to have insurance for everybody,&#8221; Trump added. &#8220;There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can&#8217;t pay for it, you don&#8217;t get it. That&#8217;s not going to happen with us.&#8221;People covered under the law &#8220;can expect to have great health care,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It will be in a much simplified form. Much less expensive and much better.&#8221;-AFP
