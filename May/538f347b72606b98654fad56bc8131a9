DESPITE what seems to have been an impressive season for Proteas wicketkeeper/batsman Quinton de Kock feels his best is yet to come. The 24 year old was a central component in what was an outstanding season for the Proteas, when they claimed three ODI series wins and three Test series wins. De Kock was outstanding throughout the season.He began with an innings of 178 in the first ODI against Australia at Centurion and continued to dominate at the top of the order, scoring six half centuries and two hundreds. He also scored two tons in the Test arena, the first against Australia, where he helped the Proteas secure the series win.His outstanding performances were rewarded during the Cricket South Africa awards ceremony on Saturday where he walked away with five titles. He was named South African Cricketer of the Year and his haul was one short of the six prizes handed to Kagiso Rabada last year. De Kock was also named Test cricketer and ODI cricketer of the year and earned the player s player of the year and fan s player of the year. He highlighted areas he felt he needed to improve on next season. Sometimes my technique isn t the best on slow decks. Fast wicets are my game, De Kock said. I still have a lot to work on. It makes me enjoy the game more if I win individual accolades but I just want to contribute, even if it s just a run out. I want to feel like I ve done something to help the team. De Kock has also shown great improvement with his wicketkeeping by taking some stunning catches in the process and has been hailed for his aggressive batting. I m slowly growing up, I guess, and getting more mature about my game just becoming cleverer with the way I do things, the way I prepare for games, he said. To be honest I didn t pay much attention to my keeping this season.nevillek@thenewage.co.za-Neville Khoza
