Improving Orlando Pirates striker Thamsanqa Gabuza could just be the man for big moments . For nearly two seasons now, Gabuza has hardly delivered as his progress stalled; he was expected to leave the Buccaneers when his contract expires at the end of the season.To put his situation into perspective, the former Bafana Bafana striker scored only three goals in 20 matches last season and has continued on a slippery slope, being without a goal in 14 matches this season. His last Premiership goal came against Kaizer Chiefs in January 2016, before he scored in their 2-1 win against Chippa United at the weekend.The win has pushed the Buccaneers back into the top-eight bracket with 31 points from 25 matches and could entrench themselves with a win in their next match against Bidvest Wits tomorrow. While Tendai Ndoro struggles to regain form, Gabuza seems to be stepping up and delivering in the number nine role. The 29-year-old forward has been making the most of the opportunities Jonevret has been affording since he arrived three months ago. He is a contact player, a hard player who gets in the defenders faces, coach Kjell Jonevret said of Gabuza. I ve only seen Ndoro (Tendai) and Gabuza mainly and I like what they offer. Gabuza is a guy who can get into the box and do something for you. Gabuza is going to get better. He hasn t been playing much. But when he has, he has shown me something positive. I reward positivity. And his faith has been repaid with the two crucial goals scored in both the league and in the Nedbank Cup.Pirates have only lost once under Jonevret, a league defeat to Free State Stars, and will have to build on their win against Chippa to finish further up in the Absa Premiership. We made a little gap between Chippa and the other teams and we also closed the gap (for the top eight), Jonevret said. It s two wins and a draw. So we are on our way. -KGOMOTSO SETHUSHA|kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
