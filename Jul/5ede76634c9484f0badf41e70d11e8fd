He&#39;s only there to steal money. Trust me.&mdash; Tracksuit (@ThabisoMosia) July 12, 2017Mosia disclosed how this famous Poet used the late Mandoza&#8217;s funeral to gain money by asking several Ministers for their hand.With all due respect to the family. Mzwakhe might be a family friend.But trust me,now he&#39;s there to steal.He has no good intentions at all.&mdash; Tracksuit (@ThabisoMosia) July 12, 2017&nbsp;Part of the scam.They ask the family how they can help(venue hire,food, transport, sound).They then go to Ministers/MEC&#39;s to ask for the $$&mdash; Tracksuit (@ThabisoMosia) July 12, 2017He further claims that he wanted 70k to organise sound for Mandoza&#8217; funeral in 2016.Mosia says that he has known Mandoza for 16 years.&nbsp;The Ministers/MEC then give them the $$$..But they keep most of it and pretend they didn&#39;t get enough. Family then must start all over again&mdash; Tracksuit (@ThabisoMosia) July 12, 2017Mzwakhe wanted 70k to organize sound for MDZ funeral.We(fam) said no cos @ArthurMafokate was offering his sound for free.Mzwakhe threw a fit&mdash; Tracksuit (@ThabisoMosia) July 12, 2017According to reports in 2016 Mbuli and Kevin Ntaopane had attempted to defraud Mandoza&#8217;s estate by requesting funds from the Musicians Association of South Africa (Masa) to bankroll Nkalakatha Records, without knowledge of Mandoza&#8217;s widow, Mpho Tshabalala.Even though later Mpho insisted she had not accused anyone of fraud. Mosia said Mbuli later dropped his price to 35k but they turned him down.Mzwakhe and his cronies then dropped their soumd price to 35k. We still said no. They went berserk and went to consult outside. I WAS THERE.&mdash; Tracksuit (@ThabisoMosia) July 12, 2017Before going outside Mzwakhe said to his cronies &quot;Asambeni akho Mali la, Uyasbulala u @ArthurMafokate ngento za Mahala&quot;&mdash; Tracksuit (@ThabisoMosia) July 12, 2017I personally asked Mzwakhe why he would even want a penny to provide sound for a fellow musician. Surely they could provide free like Arthur&mdash; Tracksuit (@ThabisoMosia) July 12, 2017Mzwakhe and a guy called Morris Roda told us that had secured S Bank Arena for MDZ memorial. We were relieved until i asked them for proof&mdash; Tracksuit (@ThabisoMosia) July 12, 2017Day before MDZ memorial they still couldn&#39;t provide proof.I drove to SB Arena only to find management hadn&#39;t even spoken to them.Was shocked&mdash; Tracksuit (@ThabisoMosia) July 12, 2017S Bank Arena told me they do this all the time and we should not trust them. That time they&#39;d gone to 3 ministers/mec&#39;s asking for 100k each&mdash; Tracksuit (@ThabisoMosia) July 12, 2017However Mbuli has denied the allegation made against him saying ministers must be contacted to prove the allegations and there is no money that was given to him.Mosia further claims that the funeral programme on the day was not the one previously agreed to because Mbuli added his own pastors.Cut a long story short. We didn&#39;t see that 200k. Family once again had to girl out the full 90k for venue hire cos time was running out.&mdash; Tracksuit (@ThabisoMosia) July 12, 2017&nbsp;Minister Mthethwa is the only one that didn&#39;t give them 100k cos his advisor contacted us first to ask if they should give Mzwakhe the money&mdash; Tracksuit (@ThabisoMosia) July 12, 2017&nbsp;Mbuli denied saying he simply followed Minister Mthethwa&#8217;s instructions,when asked if he will lay any charges against Mosia he said this is only hearsay and he can only respond to written allegations.Mzwakhe also has a scam involving the funeral program and who speaks/peaches/perfoms. This is one of the saddest cos pastors are involved&mdash; Tracksuit (@ThabisoMosia) July 12, 2017MDZ funeral ran 55 mins late cos Mzwakhe (MC) put his own pastors/ singers on the programme. And at Grace there&#39;s a fine for being over time&mdash; Tracksuit (@ThabisoMosia) July 12, 2017Mzwakhe asks pastors/singers for $ so he can put them in the program for what he terms &#39;exposure&#39;. He didn&#39;t want the family Rev to preach !&mdash; Tracksuit (@ThabisoMosia) July 12, 2017MEC&#39; Faith Mazibuko&#39;s reps said they had no instruction to give the money to Mzwakhe. He was furious. I was in that meeting.&mdash; Tracksuit (@ThabisoMosia) July 12, 2017Mzwakhe told the MEC&#39;s reps that he organised the venue and spoke to the MEC therefore the $$ must go to him. The reps stood their ground&mdash; Tracksuit (@ThabisoMosia) July 12, 2017Mosia said when he saw that Mbuli is the spokesperson for Phiri&#8217;s funeral he decided to come out because of his experience dealing with him.TNA Reporter &nbsp;&nbsp;Was in 2 family meetings with Mzwakhe Mbuli and his &#39;legends&#39; cronies at MDZ.They tried to steal every penny, from food,sound,venue hire etc&mdash; Tracksuit (@ThabisoMosia) July 12, 2017
