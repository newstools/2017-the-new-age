Pop singer Ed Sheeran on Friday broke all-time records on Spotify as fans rushed to hear two songs from his upcoming album.The British singer-songwriter&#8217;s &#8220;Shape of You&#8221; became the top song ever for a single week on the world&#8217;s largest streaming website, with 52,359,013 listens through Thursday.&#8220;Shape of You&#8221; shattered the previous record for a single week set by Canadian rapper Drake&#8217;s &#8220;One Dance&#8221; in May.Sheeran&#8217;s track also broke the record for streams in a first week set in 2015 by Adele with her ballad &#8220;Hello.&#8221;Both &#8220;Shape of You&#8221; and Sheeran&#8217;s other new track, &#8220;Castle on the Hill,&#8221; topped previous feats for first-day streams when he released them on January 6.&#8220;Shape of You,&#8221; a minimalist dance tune about picking up a woman at a bar, and the rockier &#8220;Castle on the Hill&#8221; will both feature on Sheeran&#8217;s upcoming third album, &#8220;Divide.&#8221;The album, which like Sheeran&#8217;s previous two albums is named after a mathematical symbol, will come out on March 3.The 25-year-old singer and guitarist saw his career rise rapidly after initial struggles. He moved to Los Angeles in 2010 with little set plan, initially playing at open-microphone nights in bars and cafes.Within a few years Sheeran had landed a record deal and was taken under the wing of pop superstar Taylor Swift before he found global stardom with his ballad &#8220;Thinking Out Loud.&#8221;He won Song of the Year at the Grammys in 2016 with &#8220;Thinking Out Loud,&#8221; which broke an earlier Spotify record and remains the service&#8217;s fifth most-streamed song ever.AFP
