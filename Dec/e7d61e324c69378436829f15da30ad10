The South African Revenue Service (Sars) has refuted media reports that it paid Chief Officer of Business and Individual Tax Jonas Makwakwa a bonus while he was on suspension. Sars says, despite Commissioner Tom Moyane stating in Parliament that Makwakwa was never paid a bonus while on suspension, the media continues to report otherwise. The revenue service has also denied that Makwakwa was given preferential treatment and that Moyane interfered in his investigation. “Mr Makwakwa received a bonus payment related to the period, preceding his suspension, as he was only suspended in September 2016.” Sars said in a statement. Makwakwa was put on suspension after the Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) found that there had been mysterious payments of nearly R1.2 million into his and his partner’s accounts. After receiving the report, Sars established an investigation into the allegations, conducted by Hogan Lovells, which exonerated Makwakwa. He was reinstated in November. While addressing the standing committee on finance in Parliament about Makwakwa’s reinstatement, Moyane said Hogan Lovells had not conducted a criminal investigation into Makwakwa. Advocate Terry Motau chaired the disciplinary hearing. Members of Parliament (MPs) requested that Motau’s report be made available. “Sars wishes to confirm that Motau has submitted the final report which found that Mr Makwakwa was not guilty of any of the charges leveled against him.” The revenue service said it issued a statement because it wished to clarify after the media continued to misinform the public about Makwakwa. Sars has appealed to the media to uphold the highest standards of factual, fair and accurate reportage. -TNA Reporter
