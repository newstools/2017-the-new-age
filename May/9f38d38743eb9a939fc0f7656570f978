The matric pass rate in the Western Cape for 2016 has gone up by 1% after supplementary examinations, the provincial department of education announced.A total of 765 candidates passed the supplementary examinations, while 73 candidates passed their matric after applying for a re-mark. This means that an additional 838 candidates have now achieved their National Senior Certificate (NSC), MEC Debbie Sch fer said. The Western Cape now has a total of 44563 learners that passed the 2016 NSC, increasing our overall pass rate from 86% to 87.3%. While we are proud that we were able to increase our pass rate, this is not our primary indicator of success. Sch fer said the department s main objective was to increase the actual number of pupils passing matric and the quality of the passes.The province last year came second to the Free State, which attained an 88.2% pass rate. We are pleased to see a further increase in the number passing and further improvement in the quality of the passes, she said. Quality indicators include the percentage of candidates who qualify for bachelor degree studies. The percentage of candidates who qualified for bachelor degree studies has also increased from 40.9% to 41.1%.Eighty-nine pupils, who wrote supplementary exams, passed with bachelor degree passes, while 94 passed with bachelor degree study passes after applying for a re-mark.This means that 183 additional pupils from the Western Cape have achieved a bachelors pass. My heartiest congratulations go to these learners who did not give up, worked hard, learnt from their failures and went the extra mile to ensure that they achieved their NSC. I am so proud of you, Sch fer said.Candidates who have yet to receive their results via the post can call the Western Cape education department (WCED) certification/examinations division to obtain their results by phoning 0214672000.The 2016 NSC overall pass rate, with progressed pupils excluded, stood at 76.2%.With the progressed pupils, the overall pass rate is 72.5%, which represents 442672 candidates who have passed, the second largest in history.LILLIAN SELAPISAnews@thenewage.co.za
