The case of assault against former ANC Nelson Mandela Bay regional chairperson Andile Lungisa has been postponed to April 11 for trial dates to be arranged.Lungisa, 39, and Ward 19 Councillor Gamalihleli Maqula, 28, are facing charges of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.While busy with his council meeting, Lungisa was ordered by the Port Elizabeth Magistrate court on Thursday morning to immediately appear before court or a warrant of arrest will be issued.In October 2016 Lungisa was accused of hitting DA Councillor Rano Kayser over the head with a glass jug, while Maqula is accused of stabbing DA chief whip Werner Senekal in the back with a sharp object during a council skirmish.In 2016 commotion erupted in the Nelson Mandela Bay, just moments before mayor Athol Trollip and his team were to announce the appointment of a new municipal manager Vuyo Mlokoti, a former official at the City of Johannesburg and ex-municipal manager of the Amathole District Municipality.&#8220;It is reported that two Councillors approached the speaker s table, Trollip said. They went up there clearly with the intention to intimidate and assault the speaker.TNA Reporter
