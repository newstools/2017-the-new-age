Mr Brain Molefe must account on why he resigned at Eskom and answer on all allegations levelled against him and others, Cosatu s Secretary General Bheki Ntshalintshali said on Thursday.Ntshalintshali added that the federation was not happy with the way the African National Congress (ANC) handled Molefe s deployment to parliament.
