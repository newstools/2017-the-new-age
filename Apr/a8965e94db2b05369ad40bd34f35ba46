THE first quarter of the year is towards its end, but in Port Elizabeth s northern areas, hundreds of pupils are without textbooks and stationery as their schools have still not received their full annual allocations.These concerns were addressed in January in the Eastern Cape legislature by the education portfolio committee. The committee visited the schools to assess their readiness for this calendar year and evaluate last year s academic results.There were many problems that were discovered, such as the abuse of sick leave by teachers, shortage of classrooms and unfilled vacant funded posts.The worst-affected schools include Strelitzia Primary, which has only received 12% of its textbook and stationery quota, Astra Primary (29%), West End Primary (30%), Bethelsdorp Road Primary (40%) and Papenkuil Primary (48%).Member of the committee Phumelele Ndamase criticised the central procurement process of the department of education and said it was abnormal. He said that the superintendent-general of the department, Themba Kojana, should resolve the issue of central procurement. We do not accept any excuses being made by the department. This issue of textbooks and stationery has not been handled well this year and we are going to make a finding out of this, he said.Eastern Cape education department spokesperson Mtima Mali said in December the department had already delivered stationary to 5 205 quintile 1, 2 and 3 schools, as well as 55 quintile 4 and 5 schools, who opted to be part of the central procurement process. He said a further 105 quintile 4 and 5 schools chose not to participate in the central procurement process and were therefore responsible for procuring stationary from their own budgets. Due to the fact that a new literature textbook was introduced for Grade 12 pupils this year, and the new subject of Technical Mathematics was introduced for Grade 11s, it was necessary to provide schools with these new books. To date, deliveries of the literature textbooks to schools are standing at 98% and the final 2% are currently being delivered to schools, Mtima said. Those that operate in the education sector will be aware that textbooks have a five-year life span and therefore it is not necessary to deliver textbooks annually. However, due to the changing dynamics of schools year-on-year, as a result of migration, repetition or lack of adequate retrieval of textbooks by schools, the department does annually top up textbook supplies to schools based on reports provided by school principals, he said.Mtima said the department was aware of its shortfall in schools, primarily because most of the schools are failed to implement the department s retrieval policy wherein learners were compelled to return textbooks at the end of each academic year for use by the incoming class in the new year.The department has uncovered through its own monitoring and oversight processes that some schools have failed to report shortages of textbooks and therefore have failed to place orders.These schools fall into three categories; those that made late requisition submissions, those that made no requisition submission and schools that will be closed and therefore are excluded.Nonetheless, the education sector acknowledges that it has a mandate to provide pupil and teacher support materials to schools.SISANDA MADWANTSI
