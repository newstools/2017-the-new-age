Negotiations between Vodacom and the inventor of the Please Call Me are still continuing. We are still in negotiations but a settlement has not been reached, iThe two parties were ordered to go back to negotiations by the Constitutional Court who ordered Vodacom negotiate with Makate about compensation for his Please Call Me idea which the network implemented in 2001.Makate believes Vodacom owes him 15% of the revenue generated through the concept.Makate filed court papers in November, following a breakdown in negotiations between himself and Vodacom.Please Call Me, which allows a cellphone user without airtime to send a free message requesting to be called back, was a game changer for South Africa s then fledgling telecommunications sector as it would increase traffic for mobile operators.The two parties have not yet reached an agreement.Following Makate s court application in November, Vodacom filed papers to state it lacked most of the records required to determine how much it owes Makate .Vodacom said it didn t have the records to show the revenue generated by Please Call Me as it was never treated in its income statement as a revenue-generating product.nondumisoz@thenewage.co.zaNONDUMISO ZWANE
