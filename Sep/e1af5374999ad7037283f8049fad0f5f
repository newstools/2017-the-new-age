The South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg has ordered online publication Weekly Xpos to within the hour remove two sexually explicit videos of a woman alleged to be the mistress of Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa.Judge Raylene Keightley on Friday ordered the website owned by businessman Kenny Kunene, to take down the videos currently on the site and not to publish any further material related to the woman.The woman had brought an urgent application against Weekly Xpos which had published two sexually explicit videos she allegedly sent to Ramaphosa. In the videos the woman&#8217;s image had been blurred out, however, the site had published her full name as well as where she lives.Kunene had argued that the videos were in the public interest as they were linked to the Deputy President however in her ruling Judge Keightley said the woman s right to privacy outweighed the public interest.Kunene who was also ordered to pay the costs of the application said he will be consulting his lawyers to decide whether to appeal the ruling.-Siphiwe Mchunu
