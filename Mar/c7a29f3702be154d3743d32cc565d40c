Caster Semenya is still undecided on the races she will compete in at the SA Senior Championships in Potchefstroom next month. But judging by her astonishing form, the Olympic medallist may as well test her strength in the 400m, 800m and 1 500m to pummel all opponents as she has been doing since she kickstarted the season.The 400m national record holder was in her element at the Sasol-NWU International Athletics meeting in Sasolburg on Tuesday, convincingly winning the 300m sprint. It was a rare entry for the track queen, who won gold in the 800m at the Rio Olympics last August, but the 27 year old made her presence felt, showing her versatility with a terrific performance in 37.22 seconds.Adding to her race conundrum could be the 3000m event, to step up on her after she stepped up in distance and earned a well-deserved victory in a tactical battle during the ASA Speed series in Potchefstroom a fortnight ago. It s a privilege for me going up against the best and being able to win, Semenya was quoted as saying. It means a lot for me and it shows my training is under control, so we just need to maintain what we ve been doing and try to do better next time. Semenya laid down the marker ahead of the national championships when she beat Botswana s Amantle Montsho, the 2011 400m world champion as well as tough-nut Wenda Nel, World Championships 400m hurdles finalist, in the 300m sprint.An accredited international senior athletics race, now in its third year, it provided athletes with an opportunity to prepare for the national championships. In other events, SA champion Henricho Bruintjies came second in the 100m sprint, outside the 10-sub mark, finishing with the credible time of 10.33.In the men s 400m hurdles, LJ van Zyl also struggled, coming fourth in a race won by Abdurrahman Samba of Qatar. Impressive Letitia Janse van Vuuren broke her own national record, launching a 63.82m hammer trow to improve on her 61.06m.-Kgomotso Sethusha|kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
