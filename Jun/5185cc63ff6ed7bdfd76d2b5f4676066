The government is making a major push to ensure much greater availability of decent, affordable student accommodation at the country&#8217;s public universities and colleges.He said as the department the aim was to build over the next 10 years facilities to accommodate 300 000 students.Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande said this while answering a question on student housing from the Democratic Alliance (DA) in the National Assembly on Tuesday.&#8220;The Department of Higher Education and Training was seized with this initiative because the government realised that empowering young people for the future with knowledge and skills had a much greater chance of success if they had a decent, safe, affordable and accessible place to live while studying,&#8221; Nzimande said.&#8220;The challenges faced by tertiary institutions in providing lodgings for as many of their needy students as possible is an immediate result of the government s successes in recent years in expanding access to post-school education,&#8221; Nzimande said.He also said they wished the young people to realise their potential and contribute to the growth of the economy.&#8220;In July last year we once again brought together students, universities, colleges, banks, pension funds and other long-term investors such as development finance institutions, to thrash out a way forward,&#8221;Nzimande said.-TNA Reporter
