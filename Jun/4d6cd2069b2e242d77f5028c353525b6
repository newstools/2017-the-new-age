Financial relief may be on the way for cancer patients as three pharmaceutical giants face investigation for excessive pricing of cancer drugs in South Africa.Hot on the heels of competition authorities in Europe launching investigations into cartels and price-fixing in the drug sector, the Competition Commission has targeted Aspen Pharamacare, Pfizer and Roche Holdings in South Africa in an investigation that has been dubbed of grave national importance .The commission said the investigation will attract the highest priority. Durban-based Aspen is accused of abusing its dominance by charging excessive prices for lifesaving cancer medicines in South Africa and in various European countries.The drugs involved are Leukeran, Alkeran, typically used to treat bone marrow cancer and epithelial ovarian cancer along with Myleran, used prior to bone marrow transplantation. When news of Aspen s drug pricing scandal broke in Europe, the DA asked the commission to investigate the company locally. The party later said it was satisfied that there was no evidence against Aspen SA.The commission yesterday told The New Age that it did not clear Aspen of the charges and denied there was not enough evidence against Aspen. Roche is accused of excessive pricing of its breast cancer medicine in South Africa, which sells under the names Herceptin and Herclon. The commission said breast cancer and lung cancer treatment is unaffordable in SA and many medical aid schemes refuse to pay for the treatment. A 12-month course of Herceptin in the private sector costs R500000, or more if a higher dosage is required.The third company, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, is being investigated for suspected excessive pricing of lung cancer medication in SA branded as Xalkori (crizotinib). The drug costs R152000 for 250mg when bought through an agent, Equity.&nbsp;Subsequent information suggests that there was a price reduction to R72000 per 250mg. The regulator has committed to making this investigation a priority and will call medical aid schemes as key witnesses in giving information on these companies and other companies contravening the Competition Act. Anyone with information can submit it to the Competition Commission anonymously.-THELMA NGOMA|thelman@thenewage.co.za
