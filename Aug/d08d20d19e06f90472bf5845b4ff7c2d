Following the decision to decline an Israeli delegation invite, the royal house of Mandela has expressed that it was pleased to find Parliament supportive of Palestinians.The decision was taken during an ANC parliamentary caucus meeting that resolved to reject the Israeli invite. The decision was also welcomed by many other organisations continuing the legacy of the late former president Nelson Mandela who stood firmly behind the freedom of the people of Palestine.In a statement Mandela s grandson, Mandla Mandela, said: We applaud Parliament s decision to reject the invitation for the Israeli parliamentary delegation to visit. In so doing Parliament has stayed true to Madiba s commitment to stand by the Palestinian cause until Palestine is free. We congratulate all who joined our call for Parliament to take a strong stand on this matter, including the Muslim Judicial Council, Al Aqsa Foundation, Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, the Congress of South African Trade Unions, solidarity organisations, human rights bodies and other groups and individuals who hold Madiba s legacy and the Palestinian cause close to their hearts, he said.The members of Parliament expressed their gratitude to the ANC parliamentary caucus for its resolute and firm stand to reject the Israeli invitation and called on them to equally pressurise the ANC-led government to send the Israeli ambassador packing and to recall the South African ambassador from apartheid Israel and cut off all diplomatic and other ties.He said: History calls upon us to take similar measures to those taken by freedom, justice and peace loving communities that supported the global anti apartheid movement against the brutal and illegitimate South African regime. We must not relent in our endeavours to garner support for the Palestinian cause, the return of 6 million Palestinian refugees, the return of illegally occupied Palestinian land, an end to illegal Israeli settlements and respect for international law and the many UN resolutions with respect to Jerusalem as the capital of a free Palestine. As we celebrate the victory of rejecting the invitation for the Israeli delegation to Parliament we are keenly aware that certain reactionary opposition parties and individuals will try to ignore this decision and still entertain the Israeli delegation, Mandla Mandela said. We want to say to them that the blood of innocent children, women and elderly Palestinians are on your hands if you do so, he said.He called on all of society to continue supporting the Palestinian community as his grandfather did. We call on all peace loving people, organisations, governments and others who supported our anti-apartheid cause to stand with us as we uphold Nkosi Dalibhunga s, our founding father s, legacy and his call that we can never be completely free until Palestine is free. The Congress of South African Trade Unions joined solidarity organisations, human rights bodies and other groups, and welcomed the decision by Parliament.In a statement Cosatu national spokesperson Sizwe Pamla said: We are aware that certain reactionary opposition parties and individuals will try to circumvent this parliamentary decision and still fraternise with the Israeli delegation. Those who entertained officials from apartheid SA were on the wrong side of history during the 1980s and those who are entertaining Israel today will be judged harshly by history. However, we are confident that no peace loving person or entity will lend legitimacy to the Israeli government, while it continues its human rights abuses against the Palestinian people. We reaffirm our support for the BDS campaign and our solidarity with the oppressed masses of Palestine, as well as their progressive Jewish Israeli allies, who are fighting for an end to Israeli apartheid. As Nelson Mandela said: our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians. NADINE FORD-KRITZINGERnadinef@thenewage.co.za
