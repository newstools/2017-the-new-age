AS Monaco&#8217;s talented teenager Kylian Mbappe scored an outstanding hat-trick and Radamel Falcao netted twice as the Ligue 1 leaders demolished Metz 5-0 at home on Saturday to re-establish their three-point advantage at the top.Mbappe opened the scoring in the seventh minute when he met Falcao&#8217;s knock-down with a low shot from inside the box, before the Colombia international finished at the near post after being picked out by Almamy Toure three minutes later.Eighteen-year-old Mbappe beat the offside trap and slammed home past Thomas Didillon in the 20th minute for Monaco&#8217;s third and then became the youngest player to score a Ligue 1 hat-trick since 2005 five minutes after halftime when he again evaded the Metz backline and finished delightfully.Mbappe&#8217;s pace and eye for goal were devastating for Metz and Falcao showed his enduring quality five minutes later when he met Benjamin Mendy&#8217;s fine cross for Monaco&#8217;s fifth, completing a miserable evening for the visitors.Paris St Germain&#8217;s 3-0 victory at Bordeaux on Friday had provisionally drawn them level at the top with Monaco, who then moved up to 58 points with victory.Fourth-placed Olympique Lyonnais&#8217;s indifferent form continued as they were beaten 2-1 away at Guingamp with goals from Moustapha Diallo and Nicolas Benezet cancelling out Alexandre Lacazette&#8217;s opener.Surprise package OGC Nice, in third, can move three points behind the leaders &#8212; and consolidate the final Champions League qualifying position &#8212; if they win at Stade Rennes on Sunday.-Reuters
