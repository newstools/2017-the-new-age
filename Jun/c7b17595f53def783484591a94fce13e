Several people were missing Tuesday after a seven-storey building collapsed overnight in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, rescue officials said.Residents were evacuated to safety when the building developed cracks and then collapsed, police said.&#8220;There are people reported missing in the tragedy,&#8221; a senior police officer said.A total of 121 people are accounted for, said Pius Masai, deputy head of communications at the National Disaster Management Unit.&#8220;It is believed that some people may have been trapped. Rescue efforts are ongoing,&#8221; he said in a statement.He &#8220;appealed to anyone with cutters, drillers and any other extrication equipment&#8221; to support search and rescue efforts.The incident occurred late Monday in the Quarry area in Mukuru Kwa Reuben slum in the sprawling city&#8217;s southeast.Building collapses are a recurrent problem in Kenya, where construction standards are weakened by chronic corruption.In April 2016, 49 people were killed when a six-storey building collapsed in northeastern Nairobi after torrential rain.-AFP
