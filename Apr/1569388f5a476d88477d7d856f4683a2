Thabo Senong says Amajita will wear their underdog tag proudly at the U-20 Fifa World Cup next month in South Korea but vowed his side will surprise all.After being pitted in Group D against Japan, who South Africa play in their opening match on May 21, Uruguay and Italy, Senong s charges are perceived as the side that is unlikely to make it out of the group stages. Japan are the AFC Champions titleholders, while Uruguay won the 2017 South American Youth Football Championship.Italy finished runners-up to France in the Uefa European U-19 Championships last year, while Amajita only finished fourth at the U-20 Africa Cup of Nations. Senong is aware that some have written Amajita off even before a ball has been kicked but he has taken a philosophical view of the challenge ahead. We are always the dark horse when we go to these kind of international tournaments, Senong said. Nobody gave us a chance in Zambia but we qualified for the World Cup. Even now, nobody is giving us a chance against these overseas teams. Our opponents are good teams but they are beatable, we have our strengths and will focus on capitalising on them. As the dark horse, we will come out as a surprise package and make sure that we qualify for the last 16 because I have no doubt of the talented players that we have. -SITHEMBISO DINDI|sithembisod@thenewage.co.za
