Centrist French President elect Emmanuel Macron is open to talks with the main conservative grouping, a top aide said on Friday, a day after his start-up party included a group of Socialists among his candidates for the coming parliamentary election.Macron, until last year economy minister in the outgoing Socialist administration, has blown apart the traditional political boundaries of French politics by winning the presidential election last Sunday under the banner of his own one-year-old Republic on the Move (REM) party.&#8220;There is a group among The Republicans (France&#8217;s conservatives) &#8230; saying &#8216;we want to be useful to the country, but we do not want to &#8216;Macronise&#8217; ourselves&#8217;, Macron spokesman Arnaud Leroy said on BFM TV.&#8220;We, being responsible people, are open to discussions. I am not closing any doors.&#8221;-Reuters
