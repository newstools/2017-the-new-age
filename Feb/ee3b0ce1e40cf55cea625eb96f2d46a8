KWAZULU-NATAL S private sector will have to play a central role if the province is to overcome challenges presented by slow economic growth accompanied by unemployment and severe drought.This is according to the government financial institution, Ithala Development Finance Corporation.Ithala disbursed R120m in business loans to local small, medium and microsized enterprises (SMMEs) last year.The institution says it is poised to play an even greater role in the current economic climate. Our business intent is simple. We work tirelessly to empower the community and to a better quality of life and improved prosperity, thus nurturing a legacy of growth, self-development and upliftment. For 57 years, Ithala has remained steadfast in its commitment to banking the unbanked and championing the development of commercial centres and industrial estates in rural areas, while also financing and supporting fledgling SMMEs, Yvonne Zwane, Ithala Group s chief executive, said.Through its industrial estates, Sithebe, Ezakheni and Madadeni Industrial Estates, Ithala has been able to create more than 40000 jobs.With more than 1 million square metres of industrial and commercial space Ithala is well placed to provide essential infrastructure to service a variety of business sectors thereby affirming its position as the second biggest landlord in the province.Zwane said Ithala supported the call by MEC for economic development, Sihle Zikalala, for SMMEs to be used as development vehicles for economic growth and job creation. In supporting the province s socioeconomic vision, Ithala Properties continues to work with both the public and private sectors to leverage its infrastructure base to advance industrialisation in KZN. Siyasebenza which means We are working is a series of developmental outreach programmes by Ithala aimed at uplifting youth, women and SMMEs in townships and rural areas, Zwane said.To date, Ithala has through its programme reached over 500 SMMEs across the province.The programme, which includes market research and financial record keeping, also targets women and the youth.Imbokodo Iyazenzela or Women doing it for themselves is an enterprise development journey which seeks to acknowledge dynamic women making a positive impact in their communities on a public platform. The programme has been a pillar of support to female entrepreneurs who require access to finance and the resources to grow, Zwane said.CLIVE NDOU
