Rapper Kendrick Lamar dominated the MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday as the glitzy gala took a political turn with impassioned denunciations of white supremacists in America.Lamar took the most prestigious award of Video of the Year for &#8220;HUMBLE.,&#8221; his ironic look at his growing fame in which he dresses up as everything from the pope to Jesus in &#8220;The Last Supper.&#8221;Lamar opened the show in Los Angeles with a martial arts-themed performance of the song with ninja dancers, one of which eerily appeared to set himself ablaze.One of the most acclaimed rappers of recent times, Lamar took home six statuettes &#8212; rechristened the &#8220;Moon Person&#8221; from &#8220;Moonman&#8221; to be gender-neutral.English songwriter Ed Sheeran won Artist of the Year, a new prize after the separate male and female categories were merged, while rapper Khalid won for new artist.While Lamar&#8217;s latest album &#8220;DAMN.&#8221; has toned down his earlier political bent, the globally televised awards gala itself did anything but.The mother of Heather Heyer, the 32-year-old anti-racism protester killed when an avowed white supremacist drove into a crowd during the August 12 unrest in Charlottesville, Virginia, took the stage to announce a foundation in honor of her daughter.Saying she wanted to &#8220;make Heather&#8217;s death count,&#8221; Susan Bro &#8212; controlling her emotions as the crowd applauded &#8212; said the foundation would offer scholarships to students who pursue social justice.Bro presented &#8220;Best Fight Against the System,&#8221; a new award that recognizes activism in a music video. In the spirit of equality, Bro said all six contenders would share the prize.The songs ranged from attacks on racism to &#8220;Scars to Your Beautiful&#8221; by rising star Alessia Cara, an ode to healthy body image which she performed at the awards, dancers around her rustling her hair and removing her oversized dress.&#8211; Sharp words for Trump &#8211;Paris Jackson, a model and the daughter of the late &#8220;King of Pop&#8221; Michael Jackson, also took aim at the white supremacists who marched in Charlottesville.&#8220;We must show these Nazis,&#8221; she said to cheers, &#8220;that we have zero tolerance for their violence and hatred.&#8221;With Texas being whipped by massive storm Harvey, the gala also sent best wishes to residents in harm&#8217;s way. Host Katy Perry asked viewers to consider donations to the American Red Cross.Perry used wires to float onto the stage in an MTV-style moonsuit before an evening of shifting attire, ending with the singer back in the air to slam-dunk basketballs as she performed her song &#8220;Swish Swish.&#8221;Perry took aim at President Donald Trump as she urged fans to choose a winner in a category that remained open to online voting.&#8220;This is one election where the popular vote actually matters,&#8221; quipped Perry, one of the most vocal celebrity campaigners for defeated candidate Hillary Clinton. &#8220;But hurry up before some random Russian pop star wins.&#8221;MTV invited a number of transgender US servicepeople to attend the show &#8212; two days after Trump ordered a ban on new transgender recruits in the military.&#8211; Taylor goes gothic &#8211;Fellow pop A-lister Taylor Swift used the awards to unveil the video for her latest song, &#8220;Look What You Made Me Do,&#8221; in which she showed a new dark, bad-girl image.The camera opens with imagery of a cemetery and a gave that says &#8220;Here Lies Taylor Swift&#8217;s Reputation&#8221; &#8212; a theme that will apparently weigh heavily on Swift&#8217;s newly announced album, which is entitled &#8220;Reputation&#8221; and comes out on November 10.The video proceeds to show Swift in Halloween-like makeup and then crashing a car, with paparazzi quickly appearing to show her mishap to the world.The 27-year-old singer, usually known for her squeaky-clean image, appears in the video smashing up a store with a baseball bat and riding on top of a motorcycle in a spiked leather jacket.Jared Leto of Thirty Seconds to Mars offered a tribute to two rock singers who committed suicide this year &#8212; Chester Bennington of Linkin Park and Chris Cornell of Soundgarden &#8212; before putting on a trippy performance with thermal cameras.The rapper Logic and Cara reinforced the anti-suicide message as they put on &#8220;1-800-273-8255&#8221; &#8212; the title a reference to a help line, with the number emblazoned on the T-shirts of dozens of people who had attempted suicide and joined them on stage.On a lighter theme, pop great Rod Stewart sang a new take on his 1978 hit &#8220;Da Ya Think I&#8217;m Sexy?&#8221; &#8212; this time with the much younger dance group DNCE.-AFP
