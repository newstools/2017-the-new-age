Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said several protesters were arrested yesterday after they torched mayor s car, in response to the municipalities decision of increasing the rates. A building was torched and the local mayor s vehicle set alight. The violence was sparked by the decision taken by council to increase rates.They then went on the rampage, barricading the streets leading into and out of the township, Mojapelo added.One elderly woman in the community said last week she paid half of the money for her electricity to be reconnected, but the municipality refused.Meanwhile leader of the Democratic Alliance in Bela-Bela Tenuis Russ said the issue of electricity was a big problem in the community, adding that the main reason was that the municipality was run by the municipal Manager and his puppets including the mayor. They capacity charge for each and every individual is R7, taking into account that the majority of people are unemployed, Russ added.Economic Freedom Fighters chairperson in Waterberg Lebohang told The New Age that the community of Bela-Bela were angry about the municipality led by the ANC. We are not surprise as the EFF by the behaviour of the ANC, this is what happens after you have voted the ANC. We warned our people about this as the EFF, he said.-Sipho Jack
