Legal interventions are important tools in safeguarding and improving the health of populations globally, a new report by the World Health Organisation and its partners says.The report by the WHO in collaboration with the International Development Law Organisation, the University of Sydney and Georgetown University in Washington, DC, cites case studies from around the world where the law has been used to promote good health.Among the examples listed in the report are salt regulations in South Africa, plain tobacco packaging in Australia and health insurance.Last year, Minister of Health Aaron Motsoaledi signed regulations to reduce the salt content in certain foods.The move was welcomed by many given the high consumption by South Africans with a high blood pressure. Some of the best examples in this report used population-wide interventions to reshape the environments in which people make their lifestyle choices, Dr R diger Krech, director in the health systems and innovation cluster at the WHO in Geneva, said. This requires extraordinary government commitment, courage and persistence in the face of powerful commercial interests. The report comes hot on the heels of another report by the health body and the US National Cancer Institute, which found policies to control tobacco use was not harming economies as claimed by the tobacco industry but that they could help create revenues for health and development. The use of the law to reduce smoking has been one of the great public health achievements but there is so much more we could do with unhealthy foods, excessive alcohol use, injuries and mental health, Prof Lawrence Gostin, faculty director of the O Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, said. This report offers a pathway to using evidence-based legal interventions for human health and well-being, Gostin said.Roger Magnusson, professor of health law and governance at the University of Sydney, said: There is tremendous, untapped potential to use law more effectively to strengthen health systems and change lives for the better. The law is a powerful tool to help people live longer and healthier lives, and for economies to be more resilient. The report also says that while the law can be used to improve health, it can also do harm.It cites the incarceration of people with mental health and travel restrictions during the Ebola outbreak in west Africa as an example of how the law or lack of its enforcement can harm health and basic rights.One of the most useful aspects of the report is that it links human rights to urgent public health challenges.LERATO DIALEleratod@thenewage.co.za
