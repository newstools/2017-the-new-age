ARMED with a law degree and with experience as a policeman and arts activist, Isidingo actor Jack Devnarain, who is one of the 36 short-listed candidates for a non-executive membership role on the SABC board, is seen as the ideal candidate for the job.From today until Friday, Devnarain and 35 others will face Parliament s portfolio committee on communications as the group interviews the short-listed candidates.The Durban-born actor is the chairperson of the South African Guild of Actors (Saga) and a member of the Presidential Task Team for cultural and creative industries.Saga vice-secretary Francis Chouler said they believed in the leadership brought by the actor who, over the years, has graduated from being an actor to one of the most trusted activists in the performing arts and broadcasting industry.Chouler said the actor would provide a critical perspective and knowledge of the industry s grass roots and enrich the board s understanding of the broadcasting business as a whole.
