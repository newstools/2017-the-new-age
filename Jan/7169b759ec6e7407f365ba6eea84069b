Free State farmers are bracing themselves for a fruitful and improved planting season in 2017.After going through the worst drought in decades, there could be a maize surplus which would provide relief to cash-strapped consumers.Grain SA has confirmed the province can expect a maize surplus in 2017 after good rains fell over large parts of the maize producing areas.Most farmers in the eastern Free State have finished planting maize and soya beans.While it s a bit slower for those in the western Free State, Grain SA CEO Jannie de Villiers, says planting season is continuing.They expect a good season but more rain is needed in several areas.The Free State produces 34% of maize in the country while 32% is produced in the North West, 24% in Mpumalanga and 3% in KwaZulu-Natal.South Africa consumes 10.5 million tons of maize annually and only produced 7.5 million tons last season, creating the need for imports.Agbiz economist Wandile Sihlobo said so far, 51% of white and yellow maize which the country needed has been imported from Argentina and Mexico. We are yet to see the remaining imports come in the remaining months running up into 2017 April, he said.In a normal season, South Africa harvests 12.5 million tons of maize and was traditionally a net exporter of maize.Although farmers have celebrated the recent rains, farmers in the western parts of the province are not yet out of the woods.The wheat harvest in the area has also suffered due to severe drought.With the current high temperatures, farmers can only pray and hope for more rainfall in their area.Earlier in 2016, Premier Ace Magashule said, during the state of the province address, the devastating drought experienced in the province had affected the socio-economic climate.Apart from job losses, the drought also led to increased food prices.South Africa is battling the worst drought since 1992.This has led to seven provinces, Free State, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, North West, Northern Cape and Eastern Cape, declaring a state of drought disaster.In the 2015-16 financial year that ended on March 31, 2016, the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (DAFF) and the provincial departments of agriculture allocated R263m towards drought relief through re-prioritising the Comprehensive Agricultural Support Programme.Provinces also made R198m available through their equitable share funding.These funds were utilised to assist affected farmers with animal feed and water reticulation for livestock.For the 2016-2017 financial year, the DAFF further requested for drought relief assistance from the National Treasury through the National Disaster Management Centre, of which R212m was made available for the provision of animal feed for October, November and December 2016.TNA REPORTERnews@thenewage.co.za
