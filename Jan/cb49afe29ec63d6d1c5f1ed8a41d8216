THERE has been a marked decrease in child mortality rates in South Africa, the Institute of Race Relations (IRR) said, adding that this is indicative of improved child health in the country.The IRR made this finding in its latest South Africa survey, published this month. It found that in 2015, the under-five mortality rate had declined. The institute also found that deaths of infants under one year of age have also declined.The IRR said poor access to health care services especially immunisation programmes, malnutrition, and poor living conditions were three of the leading contributors to child deaths.The MEC for health, Pumza Dyantyi, was speaking during the official opening of an infrastructure development initiative and the handing over of medical equipment worth more than R14m to the Mthatha Regional Hospital.The wards have been equipped with advanced high care and life support machines after patients were suing the health department for negligence.The department hoped the improved infrastructure would prevent litigation, reduce overcrowding and infant mortality. Eastern Cape department of health spokesperson Sizwe Kupela confirmed that the number of infant mortalies in the Eastern Cape has decreased and this was also confirmed by superintendent general Tholi Mbengashe.Mbengashe said infrastructure development initiatives at the hospital have contributed to the decrease in infant mortality. Reducing the maternal and infant mortality rate continues to be the priority of the Eastern Cape health department. The highest mortality rate occurs with premature babies that need quality machines and equipment to help with their survival, Mbengashe said.He said a problem that they remain faced with as the department of health in the Eastern Cape is with pregnant women or mothers in the rural areas who do everything for their babies but don t bring them to the hospital. We would have a much less infant mortality rate in the province if people would bring their babies to the hospital when they are sick Mbengashe said. He added that the infections were related to air pollution and problems of nutrition.Mbengashe said that they had done well in taking care of HIV-Aids pregnant women by making sure they receive treatment to prevent transmission to their babies. We make sure the 90% women that give birth at hospitals do so under the care of a midwife. In the next 12 months, after birth, the babies must be taken care of with medication that prevents measles, pneumonia and diarrhea, she said.SISANDA MADWANTSI
