Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema is expected back in the Newcastle Magistrate&#8217;s Court in KwaZulu-Natal on Friday over land charges.He is charged with contravening the Riotous Assemblies Act for instructing members of the EFF to occupy vacant land wherever it may be found.And he has been charged under common law for the same matter, which goes on trial in July.In June, while addressing EFF supporters outside the Newcastle Magistrate s Court Malema said he wanted to disturb white people s peace and that all land in South Africa belonged to black people and should be taken from whites without compensation.Malema is also facing charges in the Bloemfontein Magistrate s Court over utterances he made two years ago while addressing his supporters at a rally.Meanwhile, The Pretoria High Court in March granted an interdict barring Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema from inciting illegal land grabs.The court granted the interdict after being approached by Afrikaner Civil rights groups AfriForum and AfriBusiness.Safety Coordinator for AfriForum Tarien Cooks welcomed the court results saying Malema has been making incitement for people to trespass and occupy land illegally and we asked the EFF in a letter sent last year not to incite people and issue a media statement. However we received an answer from them saying they land was theirs and they are going to occupy the land without compensation, said Cooks.-TNA Reporter &nbsp;
