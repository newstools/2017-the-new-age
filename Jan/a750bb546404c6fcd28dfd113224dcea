On the last Tuesday of this month, Parliament will host hearings into the state s plans to tax a fine, sweet white or brown substance known as sugar.While presenting his budget last year, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan announced plans to tax sugarsweetened beverages with effect from April 1. His intention is to reduce the sugar content of beverages.The parliamentary hearings, to be held under the aegis of the standing committee on finance and the portfolio committee on health, will take place on January 31 and will hear submissions on the state s intentions to slap a tax on sugar.The official name of the tax envisaged by the national Treasury is the Taxation of Sugar Sweetened Beverages.The two committees have also called for written submissions. In a statement, chairperson of the standing committee on finance Younis Carrim said Gordan s announcement came against the backdrop of a growing global concern regarding obesity stemming from the overconsumption of sugar. Obesity is a global epidemic and a major risk factor linked to the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, including heart diseases, type 2 diabetes and some forms of cancers, Carrim said.Non-communicable diseases, the committees said, were the leading causes of mortality globally, resulting in more deaths than all other causes combined and affecting the world s low and middle-income populations the most. The problem of obesity has grown over the past 30 years in South Africa, resulting in the country being ranked the most obese country in sub-Saharan Africa, Carrim said.Those who want to make oral presentations must send submissions to the standing committee on finance not later than midday on January 27.DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
