When we have found a coach the pressure on them is enormous. It s the reason why when we lose a coach we first look to an insider in an attempt to establish stability until a replacement is found. It has worked in the past. But it has proven to be a challenge this time around. Addressing a press conference, Khoza said the 6-0 result was unacceptable and he condemned the violence, saying it had no place in society. He also committed that the matter would receive the highest priority in accordance with the law, acknowledging the consequences of Saturday s mayhem may be severe for football, supporters, the sponsors and the broadcasters.TNA Reporter
