Former Barcelona stars Patrick Kluivert and Edgar Davids joined Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe on stage at a weekend political rally, drawing sharp criticism from government opponents.Davids and Kluivert were pictured on Saturday alongside Mugabe, 93, at a youth rally for the ruling ZANU-PF party in the southern town of Gwanda, in what local media described as a &#8220;surprise appearance&#8221;.Mugabe has ruled Zimbabwe since independence from Britain in 1980, and he is often criticised for brutal repression of his opponents, election rigging and his country&#8217;s economic collapse.The president, who is in increasingly frail health, is due to stand in elections next year that could see him hold onto power until he is nearly 100.The footballers&#8217; trip was led by Spanish event manager Rayco Garcia, who said Davids and Kluivert were helping organise a match for the Barcelona Legends team in Zimbabwe in November.&#8220;My job is to bring all the legends of Barcelona here, the likes of Ronaldinho, Rivaldo, Juliano Belletti, Kluivert, Davids&#8230; and to play a team of legends from Zimbabwe,&#8221; Garcia told local press.&#8220;I think that is going to give hope to the youth while promoting talent in the country and bringing a piece of Europe to Zimbabwe.&#8221;&#8211; Replica &#8216;Mugabe&#8217; shirt &#8211;The state-owned Herald newspaper on Saturday ran a photo of former Dutch internationals Kluivert and Davids presenting a replica Barcelona shirt with the name &#8220;R.G. Mugabe&#8221; on it to Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa.The paper said that Mnangagwa would give the shirt to President Mugabe, along with another shirt for Mugabe&#8217;s wife Grace, which had the name &#8220;Amai&#8221; (&#8220;Mother&#8221;) on it.Kluivert was quoted by the Herald &#8212; which is seen as a mouthpiece of Mugabe&#8217;s regime &#8212; as saying: &#8220;Zimbabwe is a great country, I think that has been ruled very good, but it has a bad (image) in Europe.&#8221;The three visitors held meetings with Mnangagwa and sports minister Makhosini Hlongwane in the capital Harare on Friday.They also inspected the 60,000-seater Chinese-built National Sports Stadium where the veterans game is scheduled to be held.&#8220;I am sure we will need screens outside the stadium,&#8221; Mnangagwa said, according to the Herald.&#8220;The fact that you are honouring our President Mugabe by giving him your own jerseys is something extremely important.&#8221;The privately-owned Standard newspaper, which printed a picture of the trio with Mugabe, said they had made a brief appearance at the rally on Saturday after attending the opening of a local community information centre.&#8211; &#8216;Endorsing a tyrant&#8217; &#8211;&#8220;They should be ashamed of themselves,&#8221; Obert Gutu, spokesman of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) opposition party, told AFP.&#8220;They seemed to be endorsing a despotic tyrant. I used to support these stars during their illustrious careers. Many people are offended.&#8221;Mugabe&#8217;s ZANU-PF party has been accused of routinely using violence, intimidation and fraud to ensure Mugabe&#8217;s election victories.Davids and Kluivert both started their careers at Ajax and also appeared for AC Milan amongst other teams.They also plan to set up a training foundation for young players in Zimbabwe.The national team sit at a lowly 101st in the world rankings, but several players play in Europe including captain Knowledge Musona at Oostende in Belgium and defender Costa Nhamoninesu at Czechs Sparta Prague.-AFP
