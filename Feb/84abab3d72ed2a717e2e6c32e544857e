A sizeable chunk of Tottenham Hotspur&#8217;s stadium has been missing all season and the bulldozers are closing in, but in the club&#8217;s final campaign at White Hart Lane they have turned their home since 1899 into a fortress.Premier League leaders Chelsea fell there, so did Manchester City and eight other teams.Only Liverpool and Leicester City have escaped with honour intact, holding Mauricio Pochettino&#8217;s team to 1-1 draws.While their away form has been mixed, Tottenham&#8217;s haul of 32 points from 12 home fixtures is only bettered by Chelsea&#8217;s Stamford Bridge record.Yet Mark Hughes&#8217;s Stoke City will travel to North London not in trepidation but with genuine optimism, having drawn and won on their last two visits to White Hart Lane &#8211; a stark contrast to their last two home clashes with Spurs which ended in 4-0 drubbings.Since their last game, a 1-0 home win over Crystal Palace on Feb. 11, Stoke have been enjoying warm-weather training in Dubai. Over the same period, Tottenham will have played three games after Thursday&#8217;s Europa league second leg against Gent.Tottenham will be wary of that, and of former player Peter Crouch, as they attempt to bounce back from a 2-0 loss at Liverpool &#8211; their first defeat in 10 league games &#8211; but in all likelihood they will prevail on Sunday to get their hopes of a top-four finish back on track.Yet as the fans enter the 118-year-old stadium that is being rapidly enveloped by the new 61,000-seater arena Tottenham will play in from the 2018-19 season, there will be nagging concerns.Next season Tottenham begin a one-year exile at Wembley Stadium where they under-performed badly in the Champions League this season, having staged games there rather than a reduced-capacity White Hart Lane to maximise revenue.Some suggest certain away teams might be inspired by Tottenham&#8217;s majestic temporary home and that Pochettino&#8217;s team will lose &#8216;home advantage&#8217;.Former skipper Gary Mabbutt, who made more than 600 appearances for the club, does not subscribe to that theory.&#8220;I think they can turn Wembley into a fortress too,&#8221; Mabbutt told Reuters. &#8220;Yeah, the first two Champions League games at Wembley (against Monaco and Bayer Leverkusen) were just off days. It was nothing to do with Wembley.&#8220;Think of the worst-case scenario next season and call the Wembley games &#8216;away games&#8217; as some are suggesting. Ok, but by the way, there will be 80,000 Spurs fans in the stadium.&#8220;To me there are no negatives.&#8221;Tottenham are third in the table ahead of the weekend, 10 points behind leaders Chelsea and one ahead of fifth-placed Liverpool. Stoke are ninth and almost assured of a 10th consecutive season in the top flight.-Reuters
