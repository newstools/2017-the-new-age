Militants drove a van at high speed into pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing Saturday night revelers on the street and in nearby bars, killing at least six people and wounding more than 30.Armed police rushed to the scene and shot dead the three male attackers in the Borough Market area near the bridge as authorities urged Londoners on Twitter to &#8220;run, hide, tell&#8221; if they were caught up in the violence.The attacks come days ahead of a June 8 election and less than two weeks after a suicide bomber killed 22 people at a pop concert by U.S. singer Ariana Grande in Manchester in northern England. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.&#8220;Sadly, six people have died in addition to the three attackers shot by police,&#8221; Mark Rowley, Britain&#8217;s top anti-terrorism officer, said. The three attackers had been wearing what looked like explosive vests that were later found to have been hoaxes.The BBC showed a photograph of two possible attackers shot by police, one of whom had canisters strapped to his body. Hours after the attack the area, just downstream from London&#8217;s government quarter, remained sealed off and patrolled by armed police and counter-terrorism officers.The London ambulance service said more than 30 people had been taken to hospitals across the city. Three major London hospitals were on lockdown to keep patients and staff safe.Streets around London Bridge and Borough Market, fashionable districts packed with bars and restaurants, would have been busy with people on a Saturday night out.Witnesses described a white van careering into pedestrians on London Bridge and knocking over several people.&#8220;It looked like he was aiming for groups of people. I froze because I didn&#8217;t know what to do,&#8221; Mark Roberts, 53, a management consultant, told Reuters. He saw at least six people on the ground after the van veered on and off the pavement.&#8220;It was horrendous,&#8221; he said.A taxi driver told the BBC that three men got out of the van with long knives and &#8220;went randomly along Borough High Street stabbing people.&#8221;REUTERS
