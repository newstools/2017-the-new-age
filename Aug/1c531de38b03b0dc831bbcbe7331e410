With the new PSL season kicking off this evening, Bidvest Wits coach Gavin Hunt will miss the first match of the league when his side takes on stubborn Cape Town City at the Bidvest Stadium.Hunt was sent off by the referee in the MTN8 match against Golden Arrows. As a result Hunt will not be on the bench against City tonight. Assistant coach Paul Johnstone will be in charge of the club. However Johnstone said he will carry out the instructions given to him by Hunt. It is important for me as his assistant to have his back and we have to carry out the plan he set in place. It is not an opportunity for me to stand up and be counted. I am carrying out the instructions of the team. Everything remains the same.Our planning and preparation is done. I will be there without Gavin and everything will be in place and we will continue as normal, said Johnstone.Both clubs are coming to this encounter brimming with confidence following their MTN8 quarterfinal victories over Polokwane City and Golden Arrows respectively. However this encounter will not be a walk in the park for the defending champions.The Clever Boys are looking to register their first league victory and keep their unbeaten record at home as they started off this year&#8217;s campaign with a win over Arrows at home.
