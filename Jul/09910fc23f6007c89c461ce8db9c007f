While expressing its unconditional support for the Pan African Parliament (PAP), the government has also voiced its concern that criminals were targeting and robbing PAP members in Gauteng.This was the message of solidarity given by State Security Minister David Mahlobo at PAP s fourth Parliament in Midrand from April 29 to May 13 last year. A report of the proceedings has only now been tabled in Parliament.Confirming South Africa s continuous support for PAP, Mahlobo told delegates that South Africa wanted all PAP members to feel safe and protected.Mahlobo said the threat to members of Parliament was a threat to African citizens. He said South Africa would do everything possible to improve the safety of the PAP members. Those responsible for criminal activities would be pursued and be arrested.In its report to the Nation Assembly, the MPs sent to represent Parliament at the PAP session reported there were growing criminal activities such as robberies at gunpoint against PAP members when attending PAP meetings in South Africa.Some of these robberies took place at malls, in hotels or on their way to the hotels from the airport. This is tarnishing the reputation of the country and increasing the already high hatred and hostile behaviour of some PAP members against South Africa, according to the report.Diplomats from countries such as Cape Verde, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique and Benin have been robbed. A further occurrence of these kind of criminal activities should be stopped and be prevented with immediate effect. If left unattended, these criminal activities targeting PAP members in South Africa have the potential to seriously damage the reputation of the country and cause diplomatic tensions, the report said.This was a serious matter considering there was already a well-grounded effort to discredit South Africa due to xenophobic attacks on foreign nationals. A basic courtesy would be for our country to guarantee their safety while in South Africa, Mahlobo said.news@thenewage.co.za
