Heavily-backed favorite Mahershala Ali won the best supporting actor Oscar on Sunday for his portrayal of a drug dealer in coming-of-age drama &#8220;Moonlight&#8221; &#8212; becoming the first Muslim film star to pick up a golden statuette.A first-time nominee, the 43-year-old actor saw off competition from Britain&#8217;s Dev Patel, veteran US actors Jeff Bridges and Michael Shannon and newcomer Lucas Hedges.&#8220;I want to thank my teachers, my professors,&#8221; Ali said. &#8220;One thing that they consistently told me&#8230; &#8216;It&#8217;s not about you. It&#8217;s about these characters. You are a servant. You&#8217;re in service to these stories and these characters&#8217;.&#8221;He thanked his fellow cast members &#8212; and his wife, who gave birth to their first child, a baby girl, just days earlier.Barry Jenkins&#8217;s &#8220;Moonlight&#8221; tells the life story of a young African-American struggling to find his place as he grows up in a rough neighborhood of Miami.In a brief but acclaimed performance, Ali&#8217;s drug dealer Juan imparts life lessons to the protagonist Chiron that help him survive in prison and in the outside world.The role won Oakland-born Ali best supporting actor at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, although he lost out to Aaron Taylor-Johnson (&#8220;Nocturnal Animals&#8221;) at the Golden Globes.Ali, a Muslim convert since 1999 with a Christian minister for a mother, joined the minority Ahmadiyya Community, a movement seen as heretical by other Islamic sects, in 2001.Muslims have won Oscars in various categories over the years &#8212; including Pakistani documentary filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy and feature director Asghar Farhadi &#8212; but none has taken a statuette for acting.Ellen Burstyn, who won a best actress Oscar in 1975, has practiced a blend of Sufism and other religions since her late 30s but has said she considers herself a &#8220;spirit open to the truth&#8221; rather than a Muslim.Ali recently told Britain&#8217;s Radio Times magazine that he discovered he was on an FBI watchlist after the September 11, 2001 attacks.&#8220;If you convert to Islam after a couple of decades of being a black man in the US, the discrimination you receive as a Muslim doesn&#8217;t feel like a shock,&#8221; he said.&#8220;I&#8217;ve been pulled over, asked where my gun is, asked if I&#8217;m a pimp, had my car pulled apart. Muslims will feel like there&#8217;s this new discrimination that they hadn&#8217;t received before &#8212; but it&#8217;s not new for us.&#8221;&#8211; From &#8216;House of Cards&#8217; to &#8216;Luke Cage&#8217; &#8211;Ali&#8217;s previous notable roles have come in Derek Cianfrance&#8217;s &#8220;The Place Beyond the Pines,&#8221; Gary Ross&#8217;s civil war era drama &#8220;Free State of Jones,&#8221; the final two &#8220;The Hunger Games&#8221; films and, on television, Netflix&#8217;s &#8220;Marvel&#8217;s Luke Cage.&#8221;He is best known however for his Emmy-nominated portrayal of White House lobbyist turned chief of staff Remy Danton in Netflix political drama &#8220;House of Cards.&#8221;Born Mahershalalhashbaz Gilmore &#8212; he was named after a child of the biblical prophet Isiah &#8212; and raised near San Francisco, Ali studied mass communications at St. Mary&#8217;s College of California.He made his professional debut performing with the California Shakespeare Festival and, soon after, earned a master&#8217;s degree in acting from New York University.His first major movie role was in David Fincher&#8217;s 2008 fantasy drama &#8220;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,&#8221; opposite Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett.Ali and his wife Amatus Sami-Karim have a cat called Nas, named after the US rapper.-AFP
