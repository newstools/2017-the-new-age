Democratic Alliance (DA) leader, Mmusi Maimane has called for Western Cape Premier Helen Zille to face disciplinary action after she came defence of colonialism on social media.Speaking on radio earlier today, Maimane said Zille&#8217;s comments are ahistorical and unacceptable. &#8221;We don&#8217;t support those views, we condemn them in the strongest sense. Her statement was completely unacceptable and we distance ourselves from it.&#8221;This follows a tweet by Zille suggesting that colonial legacy had some positive benefits.In a tweet Zille said: &#8220;For those claiming legacy of colonialism was ONLY negative, think of our independent judiciary, transport infrastructure and piped water. &#8221;Maimane added that the matter has been referred to the DA&#8217;s internal disciplinary processes for investigation.ANC national spokesperson Zizi Kodwa condemned Zille s comments and compared her to Dr Hendrik Verwoerd and PW Botha. Helen, this is an insult to black people who suffered and still experience the effects of colonialism. You obviously see black people as inferior, white people as superior and clever, this is absurd coming from a leader, he tweeted.Zille later apologised for her offensive posts. I apologise unreservedly for a tweet that may have come across as a defence of colonialism. It was not. DA will meet on 25 March 2017 to look into Zille&#8217;s utterances.&nbsp;&nbsp;
