The Democratic Alliance has lost its bid to halt the swearing-in ceremony of President Jacob Zuma s new cabinet. The DA launched an urgent interdict at the Cape High following Zuma s axing of Finance Minister, Pravin Gordhan and his Deputy, Mcebisi Jonas. The party said it was a move designed to complete his self-serving project of State Capture.The court, however, said that justice was not served by acting in haste. The Judge OL Rodgers said that &#8220;irreparable harm&#8221;, is simply an assumption, and it was not the court s mandate to predetermine whether the appointments are good or bad . Judge Rodgers said the political party could launch a review of his decision. &#8211; Staff Reporter &nbsp;
