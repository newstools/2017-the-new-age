With his contractual dispute still unresolved, Keagan Dolly has attracted interest from yet another overseas club.French side Montpellier, who campaign in the Ligue 1, are said to have offered a sum of just over R7m for the Bafana Bafana midfielder.Recently, Greek side Olympicos approached Sundowns but were turned off by the African champions reportedly hefty selling price.The French club spotted Dolly during the Olympic Games in Brazil in August and are apparently interested in his ability to play either on the wing or in an attacking midfield role, according to reports in France.Dolly s unresolved dispute with Mamelodi Sundowns over an extension of his contract has also not gone unnoticed overseas.It makes the player more sellable in the opinion of the French, because if Sundowns are to get any decent return from their initial transfer fee to Ajax Cape Town, they could be tempted to sell in the January transfer window.However, club bosses at Chloorkop reportedly turned down a R11.5m offer from Greek side Olympiakos for Dolly.This is the event that triggered the player s dispute with the club, who claim the buyout clause specified in his contract is a mistake.A verdict had been expected before Christmas but has not yet been handed down by the PSL s dispute resolution chamber.If Dolly does move to Ligue 1, he will join former Bafana Bafana colleague Kermit Erasmus who is on the books of Rennes but has seen little game time since his departure from Orlando Pirates just under one year ago.Dolly s stock rose tremendously last year, when he helped win the CAF Champions League and played at the Club World Cup for the African champions.Montpellier were surprise French champions in 2012 and used to count Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud as their star performer.LINDA XIMBA| sports@thenewage.co.za
