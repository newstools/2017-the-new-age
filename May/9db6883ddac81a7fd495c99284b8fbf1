Families must do more to protect their children and refrain from protecting the perpetrators of abuse out of blind loyalty, Gauteng MEC for social development Nandi Mayathula-Khoza said.As South Africa celebrates the Child Protection Week, Mayathula-Khoza warned that families should not hinder the efforts by the law enforcement to bring abusers to book.She said it was often difficult for social workers when they report case of child abuse to the police only to find later that families have taken over to deal with them as a private matter . It has becomes difficult for us as the department to deal with the situation. Please allow the law to take its course. If you protect the perpetrator it may happen again and the child will die, she said.She warned that families must cooperate with social workers in dealing with the abuse perpetrated within families.Manyathula-Khoza s comments said it was a worrying statistics that children are regularly raped and murdered in South Africa.According to statistics provided by the Department of Social Development one in three children fall victim to either being physically, sexually or emotionally abused before reaching the age of 18.The report stated that most perpetrators were known to the victims.The MEC said it was vital to advocate for children&#8217;s rights entrenched in the Constitution, and called for the need by society to mobilise families and communities to protect their children.She said that the Gauteng government would this week host an indaba to focus on undocumented children.&#8220;We have children in South Africa and Gauteng who arrive in our province and are undocumented and no one knows where they were born. These are issues we will be dealing with,&#8221; she said, also adding that to achieve these objectives , the department would require the support of law enforcement agencies.-Siphiwe Mchunu
