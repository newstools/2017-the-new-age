As the debate continues on the mayor of Tshwane Solly Msimang s visit to Taiwan, the International Relations and Cooperation Department (Dirco) has described the trip as a breach of the country s foreign policy.Dirco spokesperson Clayson Monyela said that the department advised Msimang not to visit the Asian nation once it became aware of his trip. The department was made aware of the visit and advised mayor Msimanga not to undertake the visit as it would constitute a breach of our One China [policy. In a move that is highly regrettable, mayor Msimanga disregarded Dirco s advice and proceeded with the visit, he said.On the calls made by the ANC to confiscate all official and diplomatic passports from officials who are found to be wilfully undermining our foreign policy, Monyela said the department had noted the calls , but was not in a position to respond.South Africa does not recognise Taiwan as a sovereign country, but has strong diplomatic relations with China.Dirco said that foreign visits should be about advancing South Africa s foreign policy. Taiwan is not recognised as a sovereign state by South Africa and the UN. South Africa maintains a liaison office in Taipei as does Taiwan in Pretoria. The office does not enjoy the status of an embassy. The liaison offices arrangement was agreed upon to facilitate people to people contact, Monyela said.The ANC has joined the debate, saying that the trip proved that the DA did not respect the country s Constitution and foreign policies .But Msimang s office has said that the trip was in his personal capacity.The mayor visited Taiwan after being invited to meet the mayor of the nation s capital, Taipei, to explore business opportunities.DA MP Stevens Mokgalapa described the ANC s attack on Msimang as hypocritical .He said that the ruling party had no right to be dictating to DA officials. The reality is that their baseless attacks stem from their unwillingness to accept that they have lost control of many municipalities across South Africa. The DA reminds the ANC that neither the ANC nor the national government it runs can dictate who DA mayors meet with in order to obtain job creating investments, he said. 701233-TNA Reporter
