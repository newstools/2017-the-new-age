Two women will be charged with the murder of Kim Jong-Nam, who was assassinated with a lethal nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur&#8217;s main airport, Malaysia&#8217;s attorney general said Tuesday.&#8220;They will be charged in court under Section 302 (murder) of the penal code,&#8221; said Mohamed Apandi Ali, two weeks after the half-brother of North Korea&#8217;s leader was killed.The suspects, an Indonesian and a Vietnamese, will appear in court on Wednesday. If found guilty they face death by hanging.In leaked CCTV footage, two women are seen shoving something into Kim&#8217;s face at the airport&#8217;s Terminal 2. The 45-year-old suffered a seizure and died before he reached hospital.Both women have insisted they thought they were taking part in the making of a prank video.Indonesian Siti Aisyah, 25, reportedly told a senior diplomat Saturday she had been paid just 400 ringgit ($90) for her role, adding she believed she was handling a liquid like &#8220;baby oil&#8221;.Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong, 28, told Hanoi officials she had been tricked into killing Kim and thought she was taking part in a prank for a comedy video.A third suspect, 46-year-old North Korean man Ri Jong-Chol, was also arrested following the brazen February 13 killing.Apandi did not mention if he would be charged.-AFP
