Pinterest has upgraded its camera search tool, Lens&#8217;, in a bid to make its visual content-sharing platform even more fashion-savvy.The update to the Lens&#8217; feature which allows the camera on a user&#8217;s phone to take photos and find similar items on Pinterest will now allow users to zoom in and out and tap to focus, making it easier to search with Lens&#8217; from photos they&#8217;ve already taken.Additionally, the new-and-improved Lens&#8217; will add to the number of objects the program has been &#8220;trained&#8221; to recognize over the last month, mainly focused on fashion (via WWD).According to a Pinterest spokeswoman, the extra functions coincide with &#8220; pinner&#8217; feedback&#8221;, which identified that the majority of users &#8220;want ideas for how to wear items they already own, so we&#8217;ve made major improvements to make lens better at recommending outfit ideas&#8221;.As TechCrunch reports, the Lens&#8217; advancements and its focus on outfit recommendations put it squarely in competition with Amazon, which in April launched Echo Look, an artificial intelligence-enabled camera aimed at helping users evaluate an outfit.-Relaxnews
