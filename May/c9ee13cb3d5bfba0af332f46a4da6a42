Champions Wits lost and Highlands Park were relegated Saturday after a dramatic final round of the South African Premiership.Title winners for the first time since being formed 96 years ago, Johannesburg-based Wits had hoped to finish with a win at four-time former champions Kaizer Chiefs.But the table toppers were often on the back foot at Soccer City stadium in Soweto before being beaten 1-0 by a stoppage-time goal from Venezuelan Gustavo Paez.With Wits goalkeeper Darren Keet out of position and his defence disorganised, Paez converted a cross to inflict a sixth loss on Wits.The champions received a 10 million rand (about $775,000, 695,000 euros) cheque after the match , the richest prize for a national football league winner in Africa.Victory lifted Chiefs to fourth ,10 points behind Wits ,after SuperSport United surprisingly fell 1-0 at home against Platinum Stars.The Soweto outfit will miss out on African football for a second successive year, though, as only the top three finishers plus the FA Cup winners qualify.CAF Champions League title-holders Mamelodi Sundowns drew 2-2 at Highlands to ensure they will be part of the elite competition next year, either as winners again or as Premiership runners-up.Themba Zwane and Thabo Nthethe gave the expensively assembled Pretoria outfit a two-goal advantage over Highlands in Tembisa township east of Johannesburg.Seun Ledwaba pulled one goal back just before half-time for Highlands, a former South African club giant who were promoted to the Premiership this season.Mothobi Mvala equalised six minutes into stoppage time, but it was not enough to save his club, nor deny Sundowns second place.Baroka from northern city Polokwane, who began the final round at the foot of the table, pulled off an upset 1-0 win at Ajax Cape Town courtesy of a Letladi Madubanya header. Maximum points lifted them to 28, one more than Highlands, but they are not safe yet with play-offs to come against second-tier sides Black Leopards and Stellenbosch.Each club plays its two rivals at home and away and the mini-league winners compete in the Premiership next season. Second division champions Thanda Royal Zulu won automatic promotion.Cape Town City, who were formed in the middle of last year and bought a Premiership franchise, came third despite a defensive collapse that led to a 4-2 drubbing at Polokwane City.The newcomers were two goals ahead after only six minutes, then gradually fell apart to concede four for the second time in three matches.-AFP
