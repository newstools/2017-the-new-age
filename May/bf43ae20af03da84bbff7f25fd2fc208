Relentless action in &#8220;Strafe&#8221; and &#8220;Butcher,&#8221; joyous exploration in &#8220;LocoRoco&#8221; and &#8220;Minecraft,&#8221; and a potential heir to a multiplayer icon in &#8220;NBA Playgrounds&#8221; await during the week of May 9, 2017. Strafe For PlayStation 4, Windows PC, Mac From May 9 Screen-juddering, monster-popping shooter &#8220;Strafe&#8221; recalls the frantic, corridor-funneling beast slayers of the 1990s &#8212; Id Software&#8217;s groundbreaking &#8220;Doom&#8221; and &#8220;Quake&#8221; in particular &#8212; unapologetically mashing them with new century design trends: procedurally generated level layouts, unpredictable enemy placement, and a bucketful of self-aware snickering. strafe1996.com NBA Playgrounds For PS4, XBO, WinPC, Nintendo Switch From May 9 &#8220;NBA Jam&#8221; was a prince among multiplayer games of the 1990s arcades and consoles, and &#8220;NBA Playgrounds&#8221;, with its athletic caricatures, super-sized dunks, and variety of indoor and outdoor locations is posturing to become its natural successor &#8212; if it&#8217;s got the skills. Developer Saber Interactive is known for helping out on the well-received &#8220;Quake Champions&#8221; and &#8220;Halo: The Master Chief Collection,&#8221; and the less universally adored &#8220;Battle: Los Angeles&#8221; tie-in, &#8220;God Mode,&#8221; and &#8220;RIPD: The Game.&#8221; playgroundsgame.com Butcher For PS4, XBO From May 9 Brutal, bloody homage to an 80s action movie aesthetic in which the player controls Butcher, a cyborg robot whose mission it is to wipe out all of humanity. Again, frequently favorably compared to a side-view &#8220;Doom&#8221; or &#8220;Quake&#8221; and already available on PC, Mac and Linux via Steam, where it has a 91% Very Positive review rating from players. butcher.thd.vg LocoRoco Remastered For PS4 From May 9 The adorable rolling, bouncing and singing blobs of 2006&#8217;s &#8220;LocoRoco&#8221; return in remastered form (high definition graphics supporting up to 4K resolutions) with motion controls through the PS4&#8217;s controllers. Well worth checking out due to the warm and welcoming reception given to the original. playstation.com/en-gb/games/locoroco-remastered-ps4 Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition For Nintendo Switch From May 11 Already available on over a dozen mobile, console and computer platforms, generation-defining video game &#8220;Minecraft&#8221; arrives on Switch stacked with Mario-related incentives &#8212; costumes, levels, textures, zones, audio and so on. Because of that creative element, in some ways it even starts to overlap with 2015&#8217;s &#8220;Super Mario Maker&#8221; which, while a critical success on Wii U and 3DS, is not yet available on Switch. nintendo.com/games/detail/minecraft-nintendo-switch-edition-digital-version-AFP
