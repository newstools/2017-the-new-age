Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga has called on education stakeholders to ensure that schooling returned to normality in Vuwani as several schools remained closed yesterday despite earlier hopes that learning and teaching would resume.Some community leaders, including king Mphephu Ramabulana, held a meeting with President Jacob Zuma on Sunday and struck a deal to suspend the month-long shutdown of services and resume schooling yesterday.This after Zuma promised leaders that Vuwani would no longer be administered by the new Lim 345 municipality.He said Vhembe district municipality would take over the administration while other demands of reincorporating the area into Makhado municipality were being discussed. But while some shops and public transport operated yesterday, pupils who went to school found gates closed and returned home.Sources said people were angry that Zuma did not address the masses on Sunday as promised earlier.Yesterday Motshekga said in a statement: The department would like to urge pupils and teachers to focus on learning. Members of the community are also urged to support the departmental interventions to ensure that pupils are back in class. Our main aim right now is to ensure that our pupils catch up with their work through interventions that will be rolled out to all schools. According to the minister, the recent shutdown in the area affected 76 schools involving 27 697 pupils of which 1 702 were in Grade 12. Limpopo provincial government spokesperson Phuti Seloba, speaking on a radio show yesterday, said the president had realised that he should also meet leaders of the pro-Lim 345 municipality and would return to the area to talk to all stakeholders soon.Meanwhile, police yesterday said they had arrested four people in Vuwani for public violence. This after six vehicles, one of them belonging to the police, were damaged. This happened immediately after the adjournment of a community gathering at Nandoni sports field on Sunday, provincial police spokesperson Brig Motlafela Mojapelo said.MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
