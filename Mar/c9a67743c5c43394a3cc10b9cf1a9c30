A Bill published in the Government Gazette last Friday proposes that foreign nationals should not be allowed to own agricultural land in South Africa in the future.The Regulation of Agricultural Land Holdings Bill is seen as a bid by the government to heed demands for radical economic transformation and for land ownership by black people to be stepped up. The Constitution provides for the state to take reasonable legislative and other measures within its available resources to foster conditions which enable citizens to gain access to land on an equitable basis.The Bill is open for public comment until April 17 and it indicated there is a need to redistribute agricultural land more equally by race and class, raise agricultural output and food security and to advance social justice and political stability by obtaining agricultural land to support and promote productive employment and income to efficient small-scale farmers.The new law proposes that non-residents be allowed to take up long leases on properties or land that should be majority owned by black South Africans. South Africa has a dual agricultural economy, with both well-developed commercial farming and more subsistencebased production in the more rural areas.Covering 1.2-million km of land, South Africa is one-eighth the size of the US and has seven climatic regions, from Mediterranean to subtropical to semi-desert. While 12% of South Africa s land can be used for crop production, only 22% of this is high-potential arable land. The greatest limitation is the availability of water, with uneven and unreliable rainfall. Around 1.3-million hectares are under irrigation, and around 50% of South Africa s water is used for agriculture.The ANC is seeking to accelerate the transfer of land to the black majority to help reduce inequality and reverse the legacy of white-minority rule. President Jacob Zuma has also vowed to close the wealth gap. But critics say the Bill will hamper future foreign investment from people interested in the agricultural sector or who want to buy land for business use and create jobs. Foreign nationals considering selling land must give the Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform first option on the property, according to the Bill.The government would have 90 days to take up the offer, after which it can be sold to a citizen. Further, the Bill stipulates that the minister will also impose limits on the size of farms people can own, depending on the region and following consultation.-TNA Repoter|business@thenewage.co.za
