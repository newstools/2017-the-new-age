Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa should have informed provincial leadership that he would be attending a political meeting in the province, says KwaZulu-Natal provincial secretary Super Zuma.The ANC secretary said he was with Ramaphosa in Nquthu campaigning and yet the deputy president didn t mention anything on his planned political address. I was with him the whole day campaigning in Nquthu yet he made no mention of his plans to go to Newcastle, Zuma added.The ANC secretary was briefing the media on Wednesday, on the outcome of the provincial executive committee which was held on the May 7 to 8.Last month, Ramaphosa left the provincial leadership shocked, when he immediately went to eMalahleni region in Newcastle to address ANC members who were seen to be anti-president Jacob Zuma, included former premier and chairperson Senzo Mchunu and his former MEC Mike Mabuyakhulu.ANC in the province expressed its disappointment that the ANC Deputy President.They went as far as accusing him of disregarding party tradition.The KZN PEC also called on President Zuma to appeal the decision by the High Court decision relating to his cabinet reshuffle.The party said the move was to delegitimize the President so that political power can change hands in the country.Meanwhile, the party in the province plans to march against judiciary. The ANC will have a day of mass action to defend our vote. This is the judicial overreach, the party said on Wednesday.-Sipho Jack
