THE Reserve Bank has filed court papers with the North Gauteng High Court to set aside the remedial action proposed by the public protector in her report into the bank s alleged failure to recover money lent to the failing Bankorp.Busisiwe Mkhwebane had ordered Parliament to look into changing the Constitution so it could change the remit of the bank. The Bank said in its papers the remedial action suggested by Mkhpages filing webane falls outside her powers and is thus unlawful.In the affidavit, bank governor Lesetja Kganyago said the remedial action instructs Parliament to amend the Constitution to strip the bank of its primary function to protect the value of the currency. The public protector has no power to amend the Constitution, let alone to instruct Parliament to do so, he said.Kganyago said Mkhwebane s actions had consequences for investor confidence and had caused a depreciation in the rand. As if on cue, the rand lost 1% as news of the bank s court action spread yesterday. R1.3bn worth of South African government bonds were sold by nonresident investors.Although some of these sales have subsequently been reversed, they were still significant, Kganyago said.He said that international ratings agency Standard &amp; Poors has warned that SA could be downgraded further if the government were to act on the public protector s remedial action. The ratings agencies have been clear that the independence of the Reserve Bank and its policy framework is one of the strongest pillars supporting the South African economy and underpinning their rating assessment, Kganyago said.He said that remedial action must be set aside due to its detrimental effects on the economy.THELMA NGOMA thelman@thenewage.co.za
