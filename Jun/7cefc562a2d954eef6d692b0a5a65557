Jacobs said he been accused in the regional meeting of not acting in the best interest of the party. He said this was the latest incident of insubordination by the region.&#8220;The unauthorised press conference shows an attempt to usurp powers of the PEC and official provisional structures,&#8221; Jacobs said.&#8220;We will await the national executive committee&#8217;s response but we believe its within our powers to dissolve regions. The comrades of Dullah Omar can make their own case,&#8221; he added.The Dullah Omar is the ANC&#8217;s biggest region in the Western Cape. According to Jacobs, a regional task team will now be established in order to take the region towards a regional conference within six months.On Sunday the five disgruntled ANC regions called on the party to formally disband the provincial executive committee and also to remove Derek Hanekom as part of a caretaker leadership team.Dullah Omar chairperson Xolani Sothase said they had observed anti-ANC activities in the province. We ve said we can t fold our arms when the movement goes down. The unfortunate situation is the continuation of factions that are at loggerheads, Sothase said.Jacobs has called on its members in the province to remain disciplined and not take part in factional tendencies.-TNA Reporter
