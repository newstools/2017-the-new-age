The North Gauteng High Court yesterday heard how a cop was offered money to implicate former crime intelligence head Richard Mduli.A police officer told the court that he was offered more than R1m to implicate suspended crime intelligence boss Mdluli in the murder of Oupa Ramogibe.Mdluli and fellow police officer Mthunziomhle Mthunzi are on trial facing charges of intimidation, kidnapping, assault and defeating the ends of justice.The case relates to the 1999 killing of Ramogibe, who allegedly received death threats from Mdluli.In October 2016 the pair unsuccessfully applied to the court to have their charges dropped.WO Samwell Dlomo, told the court that another police officer told him during interrogation that should he make a statement implicating Mdluli he would get more than R1m.He also said that another officer from the Hawks offered him a house either in Cape Town or Durban, a good education for his children and a vehicle if he implicated Mdluli.Dlomo said these offers made him furious and he immediately rejected them. The trial continues today.He was initially charged with Mdluli and two others for the murder of Ramogibe in 2011, however, the charges against him and another accused were dropped.In his previous court appearance, Mdluli claimed that a project was put together to falsely prosecute him.Last year Mduli testified under crossexamination that there were senior people who were part of a project, Ulibambe Lingashoni, set up to advance their agenda against him.Mdluli claimed that the operation was intended to falsely incriminate him and pull him down .He also said witnesses were found and put in witness protection in order to coach them to falsely prosecute me .Ramogibe allegedly received death threats after marrying Buthelezi and was told to leave her or he would be killed. He opened an attempted murder case before his death.Mdluli had a long-term relationship with Buthelezi from his school days, but during her relationship with the former crime intelligence boss she met Ramogibe and they began a relationship. They married on July 22, 1998. with SABC-TNA REPORTER
