The drone industry is poised to make a multibillion-rand contribution to the country s beleaguered economy, a leading economic expert said.Economist Roelof Botha delivered his economic impact assessment (EIA) of the industry at a drone conference for professionals last week.Botha, an economic advisor to the Commercial Aviation Association of South Africa (CAASA), has extensive experience in the economics of aviation.His research was commissioned by United Drone Holdings in partnership with the Commercial Unmanned Aircraft Association of Southern Africa (CUAASA). It is clear after comparing 2015 data to the latest economic impact assessment that the domestic drone industry is expanding exponentially, he said.The latest research showed the total economic output generated by the drone industry equates to an anticipated turnover of more than R2bn and should create more than 30000 jobs this year.Botha said the methods used to determine his findings include distributing sample surveys among CUAASA members, estimating and concluding results and determining the average multiplier effects on the sector, as well as comparing results with SA-European Union and SA-US GDP ratios. Globally, technological advancement has transformed a vast number of industries over the past decade, but sectors such as real estate, mapping, infrastructure monitoring and shipping have remained relatively unchanged.But drones are in the process of dramatically changing these and a host of other applications. UDH CEO Sean Reitz said the results are really exciting for the drone industry as well as the economy. The commercial applications of drones are limitless, they go where humans can t or shouldn t go and make tasks safer, faster and often more accurate. Drones have proved to be beneficial to many key industries. The economic impact assessment reveals that drones have benefited our economy and will impact unemployment rates as well, which is very encouraging, he said.While industry growth can be regarded with certainty, inappropriate regulatory structures are hindering progress. Unless the country s transport authorities create a business-friendly and efficient set of regulations for commercial drone activities, it may lead to a siphoning of jobs and economic activity to neighbouring states that do, he saidthelman@thenewage.co.za
