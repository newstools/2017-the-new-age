Three Metrorail security guards have been attacked by angry community members resulting in one of them dying, spokesperson for the organisation Lillian Mofokeng said today (Tuesday).The attack, it alleged, came as a result of the guards shooting and killing a 17-year-old boy during a service delivery protest in Nancefield, Soweto, at the weekend.Metrorail has disputed claims that their protection services officers carry guns.&#8220;We do not give our own protection services officials guns. So, we will allow the police and investigators to help us to understand where that allegations are coming from,&#8221; Mofokeng said.Mofokeng said Metrorail had suspended the train service in Nancefield until further notice.&#8220;Metrorail train service between Johannesburg and Vereeniging have been suspended due to violent service delivery protests. The service delivery protests have nothing to do with the rail operations. It is an issue about lack of housing,&#8221; she said.The commuters traveling to and from Vereeninging have been advised to make alternative transport arrangements until it is safe to resume the service.Mofokeng said:&#8221;Metrorail strongly condemns these opportunistic behaviour of criminals who vandalise state assets and put the lives of its employees and commuters at risk. Safety is Metrorail&#8217;s number one priority thus we will not hesitate to suspend the running of train when safety is guaranteed&#8221;.-TNA Reporter
