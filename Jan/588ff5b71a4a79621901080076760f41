Just three months since joining Manchester United, Zlatan Ibrahimovic says he has already conquered England, having made a flying start to his career in the Premier League.The 35-year-old Ibrahimovic has shrugged off suggestions he may struggle to adapt to the pace and intensity of the English game, scoring 18 goals since moving to Old Trafford on a free transfer in July.&#8220;If the collective does well, then the individuals will do well. I try to help the team and try to do what I&#8217;m best at&#8230; As long as I can do that, I know I will help my team,&#8221; Ibrahimovic told the club&#8217;s website.&#8220;The same thing with them, they help me the way they can for the team. I have no individual targets because that I did already, after three months in England. I conquered England &#8212; it took three months.&#8221;After a shaky start to manager Jose Mourinho&#8217;s tenure, United have slowly dragged themselves back into form, winning nine successive games.&#8220;We had our dips, our ups and downs&#8230; Lately, we have been winning, where we have been more stabilised as a team,&#8221; added Ibrahimovic, who will return for Sunday&#8217;s clash against bitter rivals Liverpool after missing their League Cup semi-final first leg against Hull City through illness.&#8220;The coach has found his base, which is not easy when you&#8217;re a new coach coming to a new team and want to put in your philosophy, your game and the way you want it to be,&#8221; he said.United, who are sixth in the Premier League, host second-placed Liverpool at Old Trafford.
