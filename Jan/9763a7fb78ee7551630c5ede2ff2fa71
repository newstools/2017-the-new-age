Seabelo Senatla could surely earn himself legendary status if his mind-blowing numbers are anything to go by.As things stand, the 23-year-old speedster is on the verge of becoming South Africa s highest try scorer for the Blitzbokke.The player, who will link up with the Stormers in the Super Rugby copmpetition later this year, trails former South African record holder and star winger Fabian Juries by seven tries.Juries scored a total of 179 career tries in the space of 10 years, while Senatla, who is on 172, is about to smash that record in just five years.Even with such an incredible feat beckoning, Senatla is still choosing to focus on the team at the tournament in Wellington, where they face Japan, Fiji and Australia in Pool B.Senatla scored his first ever try at the Westpac Stadium on debut in 2013 and would love to break the record at the same venue that the Blitzbokke will be playing at this weekend. The record is in the back of my mind, but I am not stressing about it. We need to go out and do the work first and if the tries come, they will come. If they don t, so be it. I am not going to chase the record and not do my job in the team first, Senatla said. The guys I have played with that also played with him, such as Paul Delport and Frankie Horne, told me about his great speed and try-scoring abilities. I have met the great man himself in Dubai, but we did not talk about rugby at all, strangely enough. For me, my job in the team has always been to score tries and that is still my job in the team this time around. I am hoping all goes well for me this weekend. I am going out there to do my best for the team and if the tries come, it will be great. Senatla, the World Rugby Sevens player of the year last year, is tied with England s Dan Norton as this season s leading try scorer on 15 and also finished the 2016 series as the top try scorer with 66 tries.MMASEKEPE MATSEBANEmmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
