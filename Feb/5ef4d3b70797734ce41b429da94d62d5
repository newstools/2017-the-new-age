He read the script, helped with notes, and was in the production meetings,&#8221; she said.Because of those who survived and remember the brutal regime, Jolie has been at pains to ensure she treads carefully as a foreigner tackling such a sensitive topic.&#8221;Here everyone has been through it. Everybody is standing ten feet away from someone else who has been through it,&#8221; she told the Guardian.As a result, she pushed to ensure the film would be both made by Cambodians and accessible to them.Almost the entire film is in the Khmer language while all the cast members and much of the crew were local hires.The film is also co-produced by Rithy Panh, Cambodia&#8217;s most acclaimed filmmaker.He lost almost all his immediate family during the Khmer Rouge years but went on to produce some searing documentaries about the genocide that helped break the silence surrounding what happened.The premier at Angkor will be followed by screenings across the country, some seven months before the film is released to a global audience on Netflix.Saturday&#8217;s premier will be a rare public appearance for Jolie since her high-profile split last year from Brad Pitt.Togther they had brought up Hollywood&#8217;s most celebrated family with three of their six children adopted from overseas.Jolie is expected to hold a press conference on Saturday afternoon alongside author Loung Ung.-AFP
