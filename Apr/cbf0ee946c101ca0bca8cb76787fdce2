Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi has urged drivers, pedestrians and passengers to be vigilant and prioritise road safety.Maswanganyi s message came as many took to the country s roads to travel to various destinations at the long weekend as the country commemorated Freedom Day yesterday, ahead of Workers Day on Monday.The minister said law enforcement officers would be stationed on roads to curb lawlessness. Our law enforcement officers have ramped-up their road safety focus on high risk driving behaviour and will be targeting the well-known contributors to serious and fatal injury accidents with our operations focusing on speeding, drunk driving, vehicle defects, seat belt offences and inattentive driving, Maswanganyi said.Drunk driving, speeding, and reckless and negligent driving, among others, were blamed for the country s high road casualty rate.Holidays and long weekends are often the deadliest period on South Africa s roads. A total of 235 people were killed during the Easter weekend compared to 156 last year.Maswanganyi said alcohol, speed and not wearing seat belts were seen to have contributed to fatalities and injuries during the Easter road safety campaign. We will be out in force on the roads this long weekend to spread the message that road safety is everyone s responsibility and needs to be taken seriously. The minister said public education activations and operations by law enforcement agencies were planned for the long weekend ahead of UN Global Road Safety Week, to be launched on May 8. We too can change our behaviour on our roads and renew our common loyalty to our country and commit to our future by being responsible on our roads, making it possible for South Africa to reduce the road carnage by 50% in 2020, in line with our commitment to the UN Decade of Action for Road Safety.
