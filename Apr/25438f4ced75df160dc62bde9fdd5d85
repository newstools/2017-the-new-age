Contradictory statements over the legality of the march in Tshwane have created confusion &#8211; but it would seem the march will go ahead.The acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane declared all the marches in Tshwane illegal &#8211; but almost simultaneously SaveSA, sent out a media release saying that the march had been approved by the Chief Magistrate.But regardless of the legality, Phahlane warned that any criminality found would mean tough action by the police.Phahlane was briefing the media in Pretoria following the series of marches planned by Save SA. All protests planned for the city of Tshwane are viewed as illegal as permission was not granted by authorities. We do not have approval of any protest planned for Tshwane, said Phahlane.Phahlane warned people to refrain from participating in illegal protests as they will be breaking the law. Anyone taking part in these would be breaking the law of the country, said Phahlane.SaveSA have organised a march to the Union Building&#8217;s demanding that President Jacob Zuma step down.This follows a reshuffling of the Cabinet in which Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas were fired from the Finance Ministry.But SaveSA released a statement saying: The march is on! This is a safe, legal protest, with the approval of the authorities. Join us and show your support &#8211; Zuma must go! The march is expected to start at 10am at Church Square and will proceed to the Union Buildings.The Presidency has in the interim said President Jacob Zuma had no objection to the march as this was a democractic right.The Tshwane Mayor Solly Msimanga welcomed the decision of the Chief Magistrate to overturn the march s ban.-Ntsako Mashaba
