The DA has on Monday described President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s recalling of Pravin Gordhan back to the country as a setback for South Africa&#8217;s economy.Gordhan and a team of top officials from the Treasury who were due to start an international investor roadshow on Monday have been ordered back by Zuma fueling speculation of a cabinet reshuffle.DA Shadow Minister of Finance, David Maynier has criticised Zuma for not offering an adequate explanation for his decision which he says is fueling speculation.&#8220;The instruction to cancel the international investor roadshow without explanation is so bizarre that it appears, at best, calculated to humiliate the minister or, at worst, to suggest that the minister is about to be fired in a cabinet reshuffle.&#8220;Whatever the case the instruction to cancel the international investor roadshow could not have come at a worse time as the minister battles to restore investor confidence among international investors in one of the financial capitals of the world,&#8221; said Maynier.Meanwhile speaking during a post National Executive Committee press confrence on Monday, ANC Secretary General, Gwede Mantashe commented that the recalling of Gordhan was not a NEC issue. \&#8221; That is something that happens at a government level and we are not part of that. Everything else being said about this recall is speculation &#8220;said Mantashe.Earlier political analyst, Somadoda Fikeni, said the decision to recall Gordhan could have been handled differently so as not to cause alarm.Read: Analysts react to Gordhan roadshow recall&#8220;Once a person is abroad you would have a more tactical approach in terms of winding down any such trip and say just finish a few things and try to reschedule the other trips you were going to have, it wouldn&#8217;t raise as much alarm as an SOS which says come home soon. &#8221; said Fikeni.Markets have reacted to the news of the recall with the Rand rising from R12.35 to the dollar to R12.58.-TNA Reporter
