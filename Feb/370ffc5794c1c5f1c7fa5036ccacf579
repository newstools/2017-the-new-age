Rangers caretaker manager Graeme Murty questioned his side&#8217;s desire after they lost further ground on Aberdeen in the hunt for second place in the Scottish Premiership following a 2-1 defeat to Dundee on Sunday.Rangers fell behind at Dens Park to first-half goals from Mark O&#8217;Hara and Kevin Holt before Joe Garner pulled one back in the second half.It is a third successive league match without victory for the Gers, who are six points adrift of Aberdeen after they came from behind to defeat Kilmarnock 2-1 also on Sunday.The defeat &#8212; the sixth Rangers have suffered this season &#8212; leaves them with just one win in their past six league matches and a massive 30 points behind bitter rivals and league leaders Celtic.Murty &#8212; normally the Under-20 side&#8217;s coach but in temporary charge following manager Mark Warburton&#8217;s departure &#8212; slammed his side&#8217;s sluggish start and admitted his players were second best.&#8220;We challenged them (the players) at half-time to show more and I think they did but they can&#8217;t wait until then &#8212; it has to be from the get-go.&#8220;It&#8217;s not coming to Dens Park - it&#8217;s going anywhere with a Rangers shirt on. You are a target because this is a massive club and people want to beat you, and rightly so.&#8220;You have to deal with that expectation and more than match what they are going to bring.&#8220;We were deficient in those aspects all the way through the game and we were second best.&#8221;Murty, who led the Ibrox club to a 2-1 Scottish Cup win over Greenock Morton last week, dismissed suggestions the players were distracted by events happening off the pitch at the Ibrox club.&#8220;The players know exactly where they stand. Do not let that come into your thoughts at all,&#8221; he said.&#8220;The appointment will take place when it takes place. The players have to take care of their business on the football pitch &#8212; first, last and always.&#8220;I will carry on until I am told otherwise but it&#8217;s fair to say I am very disappointed with how this first league game has gone.&#8220;The players are all disappointed but they have to pick themselves up because the demands of this football club are we go again and we expect more from you.&#8220;To be perfectly honest I expect more from them than they showed today.&#8220;But they have been honest and open with each other and they have to come together as a squad and make it better on the pitch.&#8221;The win sends Dundee into the top six and manager Paul Hartley hailed the result as the best in his tenure.&#8220;I thought it was outstanding in terms of the team performance. It&#8217;s probably the best since I came here three years ago,&#8221; said Hartley after his side&#8217;s first victory in 2017.&#8220;Everything just clicked and I thought we executed the game plan perfectly.-AFP
