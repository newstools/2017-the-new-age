CONTROVERSIAL Nigerian pastor Timothy Omotoso, 59, was finally denied bail in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate s Court on Friday where his application based on new facts was turned down. Omotoso s legal representative, advocate Alwyn Rossouw SC, brought the second application on new facts, saying he was in fact deemed a legal immigrant, contrary to findings in his first bail application.The senior pastor at the Jesus Dominion International Church, which has branches across the country, faces 22 charges related to contravention of the Sexual Offences Act, including two counts of rape.Some of the complainants are as young as 13. In June, he was denied bail due to him being a flight risk. Two weeks ago Omotoso, who is facing a number of sex crimes, had another count added to his lengthy charge sheet when the state charged him with being in the country illegally.Omotoso said in court papers that since last month he had been battling to obtain a copy of his fingerprints for a police clearance certificate needed for the visa application. Omotoso said his general work visa had been extended on numerous occasions.He said he had been living in South Africa since 2000 and if he was unable to extend his visa timeously, he would be forced to leave the country and apply for a new work visa from his home country. Meanwhile, the latest charge relates to allegations by the Department of Home Affairs that Omotoso was in the country illegally.Home Affairs officer Ivan Klaasen testified during the initial bail application in May that Omotoso had six passports and had been issued with eight visas or work permits after 2000, when he entered South Africa for the first time. Klaasen said when Omotoso entered the country in August 2000, the barcode on his visa was never activated, meaning it was not scanned at the port of entry.He said that, therefore, every document issued after that became null and void. Advocate Rossouw said the Nigerian televangelist had initiated numerous projects which saw hundreds of homeless or underprivileged SA citizens homed, clothed and fed.In addition to the new charges, Omotoso faces 22 charges relating to sexual exploitation and human trafficking after eighteen more charges were added to the original four. He is alleged to have sexually abused several young women at his church in Umhlanga, Durban, under the pretext of healing them. He was arrested on April 20 by the Hawks shortly after he landed at the Port Elizabeth International Airport after evading arrest for days after the scandal came out.Rumours had made the rounds that he had already skipped the country. At the airport, he had apparently tried to avoid arrest by first lying about his flight s arrival time then hiding in public toilets at the airport when he found armed officers waiting for him.He has been in custody at St Albans after his first bail application failed resulting in his wife, Taiwo, who has been attending the new bail hearings, appointing a new legal team.Omotoso s case has been remanded to November 1 when the court will deal with this case and a further case involving five additional charges of fraud and being in the country illegally.LONDEKA DLAMINI provinces@thenewage.co.za
