The current political landscape is littered with neo-liberal truisms that cascade from the mouths of a group of commentators considered to be the cream of the crop of political analysts but who really are just the modern equivalent of court jesters playing to the small but influential crowd of conservative ANC haters who dominate the chattering classes of bourgeois South Africa.This clique of naysayers are the current nabobs of negativity that have coalesced around opposition to any kind of progressive ideas that are expostulated by government to address the real challenges in our country.This negativity embraces the status quo.This negativity does not want the current state of the economy to change at all. This negativity feeds from the hand of a capitalist system born during the dark days of colonialism and honed into a colonialism of a special type during the days of apartheid with its pass laws, influx control and bantustans.South Africa was then a frightening and evil forced labour camp where black people became foreigners in large segments of their own country and were only welcome in underresourced and bleak homelands where they were sent to die when their labour had been extracted.The chorus of commentators who bombard us with truisms about how awful our president is, how useless the ANC is, how the current ruling party is becoming unelectable and a host of other make-believe mantras is made up of powerful white conservatives and their black surrogates. These black surrogates can only be described as self-loathing blacks .They have been drummed into service to parrot a narrative that has as its leitmotif nothing but pure racism disguised as political comment and analysis.The self-loathing black commentators are amply rewarded by their conservative white masters. They are given TV and radio shows, lashings of ink in newspapers and periodicals, fame and fortune.They are feted and wined and dined by the dominant white capitalist class and all they have to do is call into question any measure that is suggested that seeks to address the vile inequalities that continue to exist today even after hundreds of years of struggle.Inequalities that exist because our economy has remained the plaything of a small group of people with access to inherited wealth. This inherited wealth has been passed down intact from robber barons, mining magnates and exploitative apartheid pigs in the trough to maintain the status quo. Needless to say the rent-a-black billionaire programme has also resulted more in the propping up of a deeply corrupt system than achieving any sort of significant shifts in ownership in the economy.The rewards for the chorus of jesters are great but so is the degradation deep. Our commentators are telling us, for their master s benefit how stupid they think black people are and how they cannot be trusted with anything.They are telling us that the (black) ANC has totally messed up the government and is now trying to mess up the economy by capturing the Treasury.One only has to look at the online columns of these commentators. Scroll down and see the fellow travellers they attract who comment on their misguided and self-righteous attacks on legitimately-elected leaders.There you will find the vitriolic racist comments spewed out by people whose line of thinking is on a par with the race hate speech of a Eugene Terreblanche or an Adolf Hitler.What splendid company these fine captured commentators keep.The refrain that the Treasury has at last been captured by the evil acolytes of Zuma is sung constantly from the rafters.But we need to remember that we are talking about a Treasury that was captured many years ago at the dawn of our democracy at Davos. A capture which set us on a course that has denied the economic transformation that is necessary to really get to grips with ridding us of the kind of trickle down, crumbs off the rich man s table economic model we are suffering from on a daily basis.The Treasury has not been captured, the Treasury has been liberated. Former finance ministers in the years of our democratic dispensation were not radical enough.Some of them of had made their own magnificent contributions to the struggle against apartheid but when push came to shove they were afraid to rock the financial boat that sails on the sea of international capitalism.This type of caution was the watchword of the Mandela administration and has been a bone of contention ever since.The ANC s climb down from a radical stance on economics that begun pre-1994 may be due to a number of things. If one is to be unkind it could be interpreted as our own version of the type of Uncle Tom behaviour displayed by freed slaves in the post-bellum era of American history where after centuries of domination many black people were considered to still be excessively obedient or servile to whites. A kind of don t push them too far they have given us political power type thing.Or it could have been for a want of real vision and a reliance on programmes like economic empowerment and affirmative action to change the economy sufficiently, which have actually just proved to be mere palliatives and not the type of radical surgery that is needed.Or I suspect it has been a mixture of the above weaknesses and muddled thinking mingled with rank self-interest all ranged against a very powerful and well entrenched post-apartheid economy.We must also remember that this business community in South Africa at the advent of democracy was not just overwhelmingly white it was all white.And that when freedom came it could burst out of the jail it had been placed in due to sanctions against the apartheid regime and range about the world as if on steroids.In doing this, South African capital could consolidate its tight grip on the economy and confine us to the role of being a cash cow with little or no power over the economy and how it could be remodelled to benefit the many rather than the few.Hopefully, now that the Treasury has been liberated from the cowed, the collusive, the Uncle Toms and trickle-down liars, we can begin to move away from a 19th century economic model that begun with the mining of our gold and has feathered the nests of the few with so much over the years.It is now time to make a massive paradigm shift and manage the country s wealth in a completely different and radical way.To do this we need to be extremely bold.Already the reactionary forces have mobilised to proclaim us a junk country with a junk president.This has emboldened not only the laughing hyenas of the conservative and neo-liberal media but also the other enemies of change in South Africa that sadly includes a number of people in the ANC who should know better but who have been compromised in the same way that some of our freedom fighters became turncoat askaris and sold out their people.Kevin Humphrey is the acting deputy editor of The New Age
