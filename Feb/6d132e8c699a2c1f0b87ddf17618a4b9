The South African Revenue Service (SARS) has warned job seekers to be vigilant of fraudulent employment offers doing the rounds in the form of a bogus email.SARS spokesperson Sandile Memela said they noted a SARSbranded email was being circulated which confirmed acceptance of the recipient into a bogus SARS Learnership Programme.Part of the scam to make it look appear authentic and legitimate, the prospective applicant is instructed to make a deposit of an administrative fee in a Shoprite Money Market Service account for the application to be processed. This shows to what lengths fraudsters are will go to dupe unsuspected victims into their scams. The email is an adaptation of another scam whereby individuals posing as SARS staff notify people that they have been successfully employed by SARS and are required to buy uniforms and identity cards which are SARS-branded and appear authentic, Memela said.Residents are also urged not to respond to emails from unknown sources and report these illegal scams to the nearest police to avoid further exploitation of the vulnerable. Any correspondence can be verified by contacting the SARS contact centre or the nearest SARS branch.SARS said its officials were legally required to present a SARS identity card when interacting with taxpayers.Information on these cards can be verified with the SARS contact centre on 0800007277 or alternatively call the SARS Fraud and Anti-Corruption Hotline on 0800002870.Vincent Cruywagen| vincentc@thenewage.co.za
