ACADEMIC activities at the Tshwane University of Technology will remain suspended for the third day in a row as talks to resolve issues between management and student representatives continue. Academic activities were meant to resume at the Pretoria campus yesterday after being halted due to overnight protests on Wednesday. However, this did not occur according to a TUT statement: Disruptions were experienced at the Pretoria and Arcadia campuses and lectures had to be suspended after protesters interrupted classes. The New Age yesterday did not observe any disruption on the TUT Pretoria Campus however a number of police vehicles were spotted on stand-by. South African Students Congress (Sasco) deputy branch chairperson at TUT, Sello Mangwane, said students declined to return to class, instead calling for a mass meeting to deliberate. Today we never burnt anything, to show that our issues are genuine, we are focused, Mangwane said. He said a memorandum of demands was submitted to management and talks were ongoing. Students have raised the lack of accommodation as a cause for concern. Students said they want accommodation. The institution is housing only 22%, which is very low. The majority of our students live outside, Mangwane said. Other complaints raised in the memorandum included allegations of a dysfunctional campus clinic and inferior quality food served by the cafeteria. TUT said: The management of the University is committed to continuous engagement with the elected student leaders. A meeting with the Institutional SRC and the Pretoria CSRC to discuss the issues raised following yesterday s and today s protest action is taking place. TUT says despite academic activities being suspended, registration will continue today alongside the writing of exit exams. TUT has said that all activities for students and staff will resume on Monday, February 20. SIPHIWE MCHUNU
