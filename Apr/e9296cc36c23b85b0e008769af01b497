The government welcomed AT Kearney s 2017 Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Confidence report at the weekend, which showed the country was the 25th most attractive destination for foreign direct investment globally, the first from the continent.Improvements in short-term economic prospects and the long-term investment in the country s manufacturing have been cited as some of the key drivers of South Africa s improved rating on the index.Minister of Communications Ayanda Dlodlo said: The government is humbled by this ranking, which shows that SA s strategic partnership with foreign investors is gaining momentum. The report demonstrates that our country s blueprint on development is yielding results and requires that we strengthen this with also encouraging South Africans to save so that we balance this show of confidence through involving communities. Our country is considered as a gateway to Africa, with lucrative value and opportunities for international investor partnerships, boasting a combination of infrastructure and an emergent market economy that gives rise to a vibrant and entrepreneurial investment environment. As part of strengthening the country s economic diplomatic efforts, SA will be hosting an incoming Chinese delegation led by vice-premier Liu Yandong with his South African counterpart, Minister of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa, today at the OR Tambo Building at the department of international relations.The visit has been aimed at strengthening the people-to-people exchange pillar of the country s strategic relations with China, which has largely been defined by government to government cooperation, business to business engagement and with introducing people to people exchange. This development completes the full cycle. We hope to see various sectors such as women, youth, academics, media and others cooperating on a whole range of issues aimed at bringing meaningful expression to the notion of freedom. As a country, we welcome this development and view it as a qualitative advance in the South Africa-China relations because we acknowledge that people to people relations are a core element of the glue that binds societies together, Dlodlo said.In the present phase this show of confidence bodes well for efforts aimed at strengthening economic relations with many regions of the world, which recently saw South Africa hosting delegations from Qatar and Estonia. In this regard, SA has heeded President Jacob Zuma s call to focus on changing any negative perceptions held by foreign investors by strengthening synergies within civil society. We are also optimistic that the current UK-US investor road show led by Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba will bolster these efforts, Dlodlo said.The country remains a destination of choice.More than 10 million international tourists arrived in SA this past year, a 13% increase on the previous year. This was more than the global average growth rate for the period.Sello Rabothatasellor@thenewage.co.za
