Prejudice against pupils of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) community is on the rise as teachers continue to be ignorant of their rights, the Commission for Gender Equality (CGE) said.This comes after a ruling by the Limpopo Equality Court on behalf of Nare Mphela, a transgender woman, against a former high school principal and the provincial department of education.The court found that Section 10 of the Equality Act had been violated. We welcome the ruling. A strong statement has been made and we call upon teachers to respect the rights of all individuals, CGE spokesperson Javu Baloyi said.Baloyi said some life orientation teachers were not aware of certain issues relating to gender equality and failed to address the matter adequately.The case was instituted in November last year by the South African Human rights Commission (HRC) on behalf of the former pupil who complained to the commission of unfair discrimination and harassment at the hands of the principal because of her gender identity.Mphela complained that actions by the principal violated her constitutional right to equality in that the principal had used hurtful and harmful speech against her.She was a victim of ongoing discrimination by the school and the principal between 2013 and 2014.The harassment was so severe, the court heard, that it led to her failing matric at the end of 2014. The court was satisfied with the credibility of the complainant s testimony and said the testimony of the expert witness that the complainant had suffered trauma as a result of the treatment meted out against her, was uncontested and credible, SAHRC spokesperson Gail Smith said.The relief sought by the SAHRC in the matter included a public apology by the school and the department.It also wanted the school principal to attend gender sensitivity training and the provincial department of education to develop a code of conduct for all teachers to learn about and respect the rights of transgender persons.The court will make a judgement on Friday.Meanwhile, the department of education called on the CGE to work more closely with it to equip teachers with the necessary training on the matter. This is an issue of human rights and the Constitution. Everyone should be fair with the Constitution. However, if they have realised that they have shortcomings they should approach us and we will help, Baloyi said.LILLIAN SELAPISAlillians@thenewage.co.za
