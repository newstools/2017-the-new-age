A rural community in the Eastern Cape woke up to shocking news of a deformed lamb with the looks of a human being. The incident reportedly happened at Qaqeni, Lower Ndonga, in the rural Lady Frere district. The picture went viral on social media, and the thought of this being a hoax have been discounted. The Eastern Cape department of rural development and agrarian reform has confirmed the authenticity of the pictures. The department s chief director of veterinary services Dr Lubabalo Mrwebi said it was not uncommon for pregnant animals to be infected by viruses. We call on the local community not to panic over this deformed lamb. We can confirm that this deformed lamb is not a progeny of sheep ovum and a human sperm,&#8221; Mrwebi said. He said: Virus infections in early stages of pregnancy may infect the foetus and lead to the development of malformations in the growing foetus. It is likely that this is what happened to the Lady Frere sheep. TNA Reporter &nbsp;&nbsp;
