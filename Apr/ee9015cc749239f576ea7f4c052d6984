African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Gwede Mantashe has on Wednesday confirmed that ANC caucus will not vote with opposition parties in a motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma.&#8220;No army in the world will allow its solders to be controlled by an enemy general. No ANC MP will vote with opposition,&#8221; Mantashe said.The utterance of Secretary General follows the opposition party s plan to persuade ANC MP s to vote with them on the upcoming Motion of no confidence the President.The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), Democratic Alliance (DA), United Democratic Movement (UDM), Congress of the People (COPE), African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP), Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and other opposition parties met in Johannesburg on Monday to formulate a plan in an attempt to have Zuma removed.It is not the first time the DA brings the motion of No Confidence against Zuma. ANC MPs have repeatedly dismissed the DA s motions as frivolous. Last year a similar motion was predictably defeated by an ANC majority when a total of 221 members voted against it and 113 were in favor.Meanwhile, last week Thursday the EFF filed an application in the constitutional court to order Speaker of Parliament Baleka Mbete to start impeachment proceedings against President Jacob Zuma.The EFF said it was calling for Zuma to be impeached for lying to Parliament on numerous occasions during the Nkandla debacle. Tomorrow is exactly one year since the ConCourt handed down its historic judgement in the EFF s Nkandla application, said EFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi in a statement last week.Meanwhile DA leader Mmusi Maimane is expected to lead a march on Friday to Mary Fitzgerald Square in an attempt to drum up support from ANC members to vote with opposition so as to unseat Zuma. Initially the DA planned to march to Luthuli House.IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi has on Tuesday warned the DA from provoking the ANC at its turf, adding that there were other ways opposition can unseat Zuma.-Sipho Jack
