Chelsea forward Eden Hazard has no problems being one of the most fouled players in English soccer&#8217;s top flight as the physical aspect of the game, he says, brings out the best in him.Hazard has been at the heart of Chelsea&#8217;s rise to the top of the table, having scored 10 goals and provided six assists in his 23 Premier League starts.&#8220;But it&#8217;s true, when I get a lot of kicks, I feel really in the game. And when people don&#8217;t touch me, it tells me I&#8217;m not doing well. No good,&#8221; Hazard told the Guardian.&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying I like to be kicked, but it&#8217;s good for me to feel I am in the game. Definitely. A motivation. I try to be this kind of player: the type who does something whenever he gets the ball.&#8221;Manager Antonio Conte&#8217;s demanding personality has forced Hazard to develop his all-round game and the fleet-footed `forward admits he is now reaping the benefits.&#8220;These days I&#8217;m always trying to have lots of touches, to be involved and to play my football for 90 minutes. The manager asks a lot of me. A lot,&#8221; he said.&#8220;When we don&#8217;t have the ball, he wants me to defend, to close inside and when we do have it I have to counterattack and be free, always trying to do some &#8216;magic&#8217;.&#8220;With experience, you improve. I&#8217;m a better player now, more complete than I was when I was player of the year.&#8221;Chelsea, who have a comfortable nine point cushion over second-placed Tottenham Hotspur after 24 games, travel to face Burnley on Sunday.-Reuters
