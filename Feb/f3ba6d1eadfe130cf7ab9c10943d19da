India&#8217;s pacemen rattled the Bangladesh top order in another testing session for the struggling visitors on the third day of the one-off Test in Hyderabad on Saturday.Bangladesh, who resumed the day on 41 for one in response to India&#8217;s huge first innings score of 687-6 declared, took lunch at 125-4.Shakib Al Hasan was batting on 29 not out with skipper Mushfiqur Rahim on six not out after surviving another tough session against the world number one side. The tourists still need another 363 runs to avoid the follow-on.The visitors had a disastrous start with overnight batsman Tamim Iqbal (25) being run out as he tried to steal a double with partner Mominul Haque (12), who was later trapped lbw by seamer Umesh Yadav.Shakib and Mahmudullah (28) then batted steadily, putting on 45 runs for the fourth wicket, but it wasn&#8217;t enough to steer Bangladesh out of trouble as India&#8217;s persistence with pace paid off.Lanky pacer Ishant Sharma got Mahmudullah out lbw, a decision upheld on review after replays suggested the ball clipped left stump.The left-handed Shakib, who has hit five fours in his stay so far, used his feet well to counter a spin offensive as the Indians shifted from pacers in the final half of the session.Rahim also signalled his positive intent with an uppercut off a short delivery from Sharma that went for a boundary behind the wicketkeeper.Ninth-ranked Bangladesh, playing their first Test in India since gaining five-day status in 2000, have been under pressure from their table-topping neighbours.The hosts put themselves in a commanding position on Friday as skipper Virat Kohli smashed 204, steering the team to a record total against Bangladesh.India have never lost a Test to the minnows in their eight encounters.&nbsp;AFP
