The provincial education department has urged all teachers and pupils to immediately start with lessons when the schools open for the year today.But there have been concerns raised by some stakeholders about lack of stationery in some schools. The department started delivering text books last year to ensure that there is no disturbance when schools reopen. MEC Ishmael Kgetjepe said the learning and teaching should start on the first day of schooling, Limpopo department of education spokesperson Dr Naledzani Rasila said.However, the Congress of South African Students said it was impossible for learning and teaching to start on the first day while several schools had not yet received all their learning and teaching materials.Contacted for comment yesterday Rasila said: If you buy different things at different times, they will be delivered at different times, .He said delivery of stationery to schools would be completed before the end of this week. The department completed delivery of stationery in schools in Vhembe and Capricorn districts yesterday while Mopani district will receive their material today, Rasila said.In the past three years, the provincial department and the basic education department were dragged to the courts several times by civil rights groups demanding orders to force the delivery of textbooks on time.But this time around the provincial department said systems were in place to ensure that all the schools received textbooks and stationery on time.Schools that have queries in terms of delivery of stationery should contact the department s Maswanganyi on 082 803 1571 or Kekana on 083 639 6076, the department said.MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
