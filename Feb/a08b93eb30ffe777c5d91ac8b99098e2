Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) is ramping up its efforts to support growth of air cargo traffic with initiatives that will ease congestion and expand warehouse space in the short term and infrastructure developments that will develop capacity in the longer term.Speaking after this week s Air Cargo Africa conference and exhibition in Ekurhuleni, the general manager of OR Tambo International Airport, Bongiwe Pityi, said that while air cargo tonnages are under pressure at the moment, development of new infrastructure in collaboration with the sector is needed to ensure that maximum advantage can be taken of the next upswing.Total air cargo processed through OR Tambo International Airport in 2016 of 350500 tons was about 10% down on the preceding year as global trade came under pressure. In spite of this dip, Pityi says the cargo facilities at the airport are already operating at close to capacity. The balancing act we need to achieve is to have the infrastructure in place for when economic conditions turn, but not so far in advance that it creates an unreasonable cost burden, Pityi says. No one likes a white elephant but it would be most unfortunate if the infrastructure is not there when it s needed most, she says. Pityi says delegates at the Air Cargo Africa event referred to airfreight growth opportunities in pharmaceuticals, perishables and automotive parts. We are listening and taking note of this.We need to hear more from air cargo stakeholders about the particular kind of infrastructure that will support their ambitions. We have assured the sector that we will not put infrastructure in the ground without being certain that it will do the job that is it needed, she says. In the short term, Acsa will reconfigure and upgrade the access and frontage roads around the cargo buildings at the airport to ease congestion and reduce in-transit times.In the medium to long term, plans for a midfield cargo terminal are being aligned with a master development plan for the entire airport precinct. Pityi says the master development plan has a horizon of decades and careful consideration has to be given to integrating plans for infrastructure that will have a potential life span of 30 to 40 years.Pityi points to major commercial and retail expansion in the airport s western precinct which is part of the Gauteng city region s aerotropolis plan, with announcements of the precinct implementation anticipated in the near future. In addition to the focus on infrastructure, Acsa has established a business development function to actively pursue new cargo routes and additional flights.The business development function does market research and analysis, marketing, promotes traffic development and seeks opportunities to develop and manage airports. A particular focus in terms of route development is what is known as the southern corridor which includes southeast Asia and South America. The business development function is the practical mechanism for helping us achieve our vision to attract more air cargo traffic via South Africa and to maintain our status as the logistics and distribution hub for sub-equatorial Africa, Pityi says.The ambition for air cargo is to attract international air transport companies to choose the airport or one of the other Acsa airports as a hub for their international and regional operations.-Sello Rabothata|sellor@thenewage.co.za
