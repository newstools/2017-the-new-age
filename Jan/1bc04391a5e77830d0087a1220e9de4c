A total of 55 young people in Phalaborwa have been given jobs to install an electrical fire suppression system for Palabora Mining Company (MPC) s lift 11 underground shaft thanks to two black-owned companies, Global Mining Projects (GMP) and Enzani Technologies from Gauteng.The jobs were ring-fenced for skilled and semi-skilled youngsters with Grade 12 certificates within the greater BaPhalaborwa municipality.GMP owner Freddy Ntsenana says the jobs created through partnership with Enzani Technologies should encourage other companies to adopt the same model to transfer skills and create sustainable jobs in mining towns. There is capacity in locals irrespective of colour because now everybody in business understands that being exceptional is not a sign of supremacy but refusing mediocrity, Ntsenanam, who was born and bred in Phalaborwa, said.He introduced himself to the world of mining at a young age while still in Grade 10 at Vuxeni High School in Phalaborwa.Drawn to mathematics and science, he designed an underground mining of the future project that won him a prize at a young scientists expo.The winning project prompted PMC to offer him a bursary after passing Grade 12 to study mining engineering at the University of Johannesburg.On completion he became a miner at PMC before going to the US to work for another mining company. He established GMP in 2012 and today is among several contractors linked to PMC. I always believed that if minerals were to be shared equally with black people, as enshrined in the Mineral Petroleum and Resources Development Act, then somebody needed to start a black-owned company that could contribute to the core business of the mining industry, Ntsenana said.PMC external affairs and communications manager Lydia Radebe said her company was contributing to the National Development Plan prescripts of creating black industrialists and therefore contributing to the development of a town beyond the life of the mine.MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
