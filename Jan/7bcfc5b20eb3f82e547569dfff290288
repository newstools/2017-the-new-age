The provincial government yesterday condemned the burning down of schools and other public properties by protesters in the Tshitale area in the Vhembe district.Police have arrested more than 40 suspects. The protesters have been demanding tarred roads. We can t in any way tolerate the culture of torching schools whenever service delivery challenges are experienced. The government does not have unlimited resources and, even if we had, we would not prioritise infrastructure that was deliberately destroyed by people in the name of peaceful protest, Limpopo government spokesperson Phuti Seloba said.Schools in the affected villages did not open at the beginning of the year and were still shut yesterday. Those who continue to destroy schools will be held liable for refurbishing and rebuilding of such infrastructure. Equally we condemn the use of school children as bargaining tools during community protests. We are ready to work with communities to find amicable solutions to their issues, Seloba said.Vari Primary School, Denga Secondary School, a post office, the water affairs department offices and several vehicles belonging to the department of justice have been either torched of damaged by protesters so far.Police spokesperson Brig Motlafela Mojapelo said about 44 suspects from affected villages were arrested. Police conducted early morning operations around Muila and Nthabalala villages in Tshitale area and made some arrests. A 16-year-old boy was arrested on Monday, Mojapelo said.The suspects will face charges including arson, malicious damage to property and public violence in the Mphephu and Sekgosese Magistrate s Courts.Cope spokesperson Dennis Bloem has described the burning down of schools in Tshitale as barbaric actions killing the future of the country. No amount of anger or frustration can ever give people the right to destroy our schools, libraries and community facilities, Bloem said.Cope also lashed out at President Jacob Zuma, saying he should lead by example and stop promising people heaven and earth , especially during election campaigns.-MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
