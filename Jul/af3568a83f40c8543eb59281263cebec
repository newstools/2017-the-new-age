Convicted rapist and kwaito star Sipho Ndlovu better known as &#8220;Brickz&#8221; sentencing has today been postponed to 1 August by the Roodepoort Magistrate&#8217;s Court.Earlier this month Magistrate John Baloyi found the famed musician guilty of raping a 16-year-old girl back in 2013 following a three-year court battle.Brickz&#8217;s lawyer, Pieter Du Plessis, today persuaded the court to postpone the sentencing proceedings arguing that he was not ready to argue on behalf of his client as he was only assigned the case early this week.Brickz will now remain in custody until his next appearance.He was arrested in November 2013 and after serving a little over a month in prison was released on R50 000 bail by the Palm Ridge High Court.In 2013 a 16 year-old girl lay a charge accusing him of raping her at his Ruimsig home, Krugersdorp, west of Johannesburg.Brickz &#8216;s wife Nqobile Ndlovu reportedly helped the 16-year-old lay the charges against the musician according to Sowetan Live.Following his release he continued to make a living as a musician performing at various events where he was booked.-TNA Reporter
