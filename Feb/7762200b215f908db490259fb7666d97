Kaizer Chiefs fans, particularly those in KZN, are rubbing their hands with glee as their resurgent side will play two matches in a row in the province against struggling sides Highlands Park and Ajax Cape Town.Both matches are scheduled to take place at Moses Mabhida Stadium. This will bring to three the number of matches Chiefs have played in KZN. At the weekend Amakhosi put up a gallant display to see off Maritzburg United 2-1 in Pietermaritzburg.While Chiefs will be without defender Erick Tower Mathoho on Saturday, owing to a one match suspension, coach Steve Komphela is not that concerned, pointing to enough cover on the bench. Look, we have to manage the team when one player is not available. When Tower is out, we have Siyanda Xulu and Daniel Cardoso waiting in the wings. The Chiefs coach feels new signing Gustavo Paez, who has made two substitute appearances so far in the gold and black, will soon open his Amakhosi account. We are just waiting for Paez to open his goal account. His movements and touches are solid and we are just waiting for him to score his first goal. If the recent performances dished out by Gordon Igesund s Highlands and Ajax are anything to go by, then Chiefs must fancy their chances of earning six wins in a row. Chiefs are in buoyant mood having amassed wins that surged them closer to the log summit.But Komphela has warned against complacency. We just want to keep growing and growing, and growth is not only technical, it is also about confidence. All we want is to win every match. -Linda Ximba|news@thenewage.co.za
