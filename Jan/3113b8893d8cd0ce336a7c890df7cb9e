Students and National Health Education &amp; Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) workers embarked on a protest on Monday at the Central Johannesburg College in Alexandra. It is reported that students are not pleased with the institution&#8217;s decision to suspend several courses at the campus. It cant be that the only community campus over the years is deteriorating in terms of courses (offered) , it started in 2008 an irate Student said Student demanded all N4 and N6 courses that have been moved to other campus of the institution back, saying that the college was built for this community and found the need to travel unreasonable. We use to have Business Studies here, we use to have financial courses , like HR and Marketing . We are left with courses that don t contribute to the economy . The very same TVET sector which the Minister encouraged people (learners) to go to are the ones harassed by maladministration the student lambasted Spokesperson for the police Kay Makhubela said police are monitoring the situation. No arrest or injuries have been reported but the police had reinforced their units to make sure that the situation returns normality. Protesting students barricaded both London Road and 13th Avenue with burning tyres. It&#8217;s not allowed to block the road even if you are protesting. You can protest as that is your right. You can also protest in the relevant place where you are suppose to, without blocking other people&#8217;s rights for movement said Makhubela. TNA Reporter &nbsp;
