#FeesMustFall activist Bonginkosi Khanyile made a brief appearance on Friday at the Durban Magistrate s Court but the matter was postponed to 12th May for finalisation of pre-trial conference.Khanyile&#8217;s lawyer requested for a postponement as they needed time to get expert witnesses and to prepare for the case.The final year public administration student was released on R250 bail this month after the state did an about turn in the Constitutional Court and said it was no longer opposing his bail application.Described as a brilliant student who excelled in all his modules, Khanyile was first arrested with 28 other students during the FeesMustFall protests, at the Durban University of Technology early last year.The charges Khanyile faced for his first arrest included convening or gathering without notice, convening or attending an illegal gathering or demonstration, interference with police duties in an illegal gathering and trespassing.On February 5 last year, he was released on warning to abide by certain conditions, but he was arrested again in a protest on September 27.Two applications in the Durban Magistrate s Court for bail were refused as was an appeal to the high court in Pietermaritzburg.-TNA Reporter
