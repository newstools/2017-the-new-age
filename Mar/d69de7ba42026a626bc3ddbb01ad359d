Pravin Gordhan was using his court application as a platform to bring &#8220;dirty laundry&#8221; related to Gupta companies into the public domain using irrelevant information.This was the hard-hitting submission made by Sahara on the second day of court proceedings dealing with the Finance Minister s application for a declaratory order.Representing Sahara Computers, Advocate Rafik Bhana, criticised submissions by Gordhan claiming that his application was made in the public interest.Bhana said the Finance Minister was an astute politician who in fact had used his application as an opportunity to publicise private letters received from Gupta companies to him.On Tuesday the court dismissed a Financial Intelligence Centre (FIC) certificate submitted by Gordhan, which supposedly detailed details 72 suspicious banking transactions made by Oakbay companies which were allegedly the basis of SA s top four banks closing all of Oakbay s accounts.Bhana further argued that Pravin Gordhan may have been trying to protect banks from a potential judicial inquiry.&#8220;We say the minister has used his office to continue his warfare against the Gupta family in order to protect the banks from scrutiny,&#8221; said Bhana.Bhana added that Gordhan s case was &#8220;imminently unreasonable&#8221;.Earlier during proceedings representing Oakbay Cedric Puckrin, argued that the declaratory order sought by the Minister was purely hypothetical as it won t have any binding impact on future ministers.&#8220;The declaratory order has to mean something and not just be a dead letter, which it is in our opinion,&#8221; said Puckrin.Puckrin added that Gordhan had wasted the court&#8217;s time with an idle application based on a matter of settled law.However according to Absa, the dispute between Oakbay and Gordhan is important to clarify the boundary between where executive power ends and private autonomy starts.The submission was made earlier by Advocate David Unterhalter who was representing ABSA which is party to the case.&#8221; There is an important demarcation that this declaratory order is making between where public powers end and where private decisions are made and whether there is autonomy to make those private decisions,&#8221; Unterhalter said.&#8220;Drawing that line is fundamentally important not just to the minster and any other person who occupies that office but it is also important to regulators and in this instance the banks who are subject to the exercise of public powers, said Unterhalter.But Gordhan s counsel Jeremy Gauntlett reiterated his argument that the letter s written by the former Oakbay CEO Nazeem Howa was designed to pressure the Finance Minister into intervening.The company refused to accept that the minister was unable to intervene.Oakbay has argued the declaratory order sought by the Finance Minister is purely hypothetical as it won t have any binding impact on future ministers.Representing Oakbay Cedric Puckrin insisted that any declaratory order granted in the case would not have any future effect as it was too narrowly defined and would not stop anyone petitioning for help in the future.&#8221; The declaratory order has to mean something and not just be a dead letter, which it is in our opinion,&#8221; said Puckrin.Gordhan has asked the North Gauteng High Court for a declaratory order that it is not required by law to intervene in the relationship between the Oakbay group and the four major banks.Puckrin added that Gordhan had wasted the court&#8217;s time with an idle application based on a matter of settled law.Meanwhile according to Absa, the dispute between Oakbay and Gordhan is important to clarify the boundary between where executive power ends and private autonomy starts.The submission was made earlier by Advocate David Unterhalter who was representing ABSA which is party to the case.&#8221; There is an important demarcation that this declaratory order is making between where public powers end and where private decisions are made and whether there is autonomy to make those private decisions,&#8221; Unterhalter said.&#8220;Drawing that line is fundamentally important not just to the minster and any other person who occupies that office but it is also important to regulators and in this instance the banks who are subject to the exercise of public powers, said Unterhalter. They need to know within what realm they are subject to private autonomy and decision making and in what realm are they subject to public intervention.&#8221;While Advocate Alfred Cockrell, representing Nedbank, argued that Oakbay had wanted the Finance Minister to exercise an &#8220;extra-legal&#8221; function by asking him to intervene in the dispute between the banks and Oakbay.&#8220;The minister says he does not have the power to intervene but correspondence shows that Oakbay was pushing the minister to exercise power they say they don t dispute, Cockrell said.&#8220;Oakbay is now arguing that they wanted the Finance Minister to change law so he could intervene in bank fight.&#8221;-Siphiwe Mchunu&nbsp;
