A senior professor at the University of Witwatersrand has been dismissed for sexually harassing three of his colleagues says Wits Vice-Chancellor Professor Adam Habib.This comes after allegations came to surface that the professor pressured three women for sexual favours as an exchange for promotions and assistance at work.&#8220;Late last year, a complaint was received by the Gender Equity Office (GEO), and was subsequently investigated, in line with the University s policies and processes related to Gender Based Harm (GBH).&#8220;An independent investigation was undertaken and the staff member was found guilty of misconduct on the grounds of sexual harassment in respect of three complainants,&#8221; said Habib.The university stated it will not tolerate any form of sexual harassment or GBH.Furthermore, it has revised their policies, instituted several programmes and conscientised the University community to speak out and act against GBH.Anyone who experiences or witnesses any gender based harm is encouraged to report such incidents to the GEO immediately for support and/or advice.-TNA Reporter
