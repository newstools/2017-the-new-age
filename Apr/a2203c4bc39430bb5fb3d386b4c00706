Radamel Falcao marked his first start in six weeks with the only goal of the game as Monaco cemented their position at the top of Ligue 1 with a 1-0 win at Angers.Falcao&#8217;s goal came just after the hour mark and against the run of play, and Monaco were holding on at the end against in-form opponents at the Stade Raymond Kopa.The result extended the principality side&#8217;s run without defeat in the league to 13 matches and moved them four points clear at the top of the table with a game in hand on Nice, who won 2-1 at Lille on Friday.Defending champions Paris Saint-Germain &#8212; who hammered Monaco 4-1 in last weekend&#8217;s League Cup final &#8212; can cut their lead back down to three points if they win at home to Guingamp on Sunday evening.For Monaco it was the perfect preparation for their Champions League quarter-final first leg away to Borussia Dortmund in Germany on Tuesday as they stay on course to win their first French title since Claude Puel&#8217;s 2000 vintage. &#8211; AFP
