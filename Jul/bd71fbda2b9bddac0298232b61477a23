It is unclear exactly how Grace&#8217;s ankle was injured.This week&#8217;s trip there is Mugabe&#8217;s third there this year.Public hospitals in Zimbabwe often suffer from chronic shortages of drugs and staff as the economy has struggled to rebound following years of mismanagement.Mugabe&#8217;s ZANU-PF party was forced to postpone a rally on Friday at which he was due to address supporters, triggering speculation about his whereabouts.Early in 2015, he tripped and fell as he left a podium after addressing supporters who had gathered at Harare airport to welcome him back from a foreign trip.The same year he also read a speech to parliament apparently unaware that he had delivered the same speech before.Mugabe&#8217;s party is sharply divided over his succession.
