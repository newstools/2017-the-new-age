Britain&#8217;s ambassador to the European Union resigned on Tuesday, adding uncertainty to the Brexit process less than three months before the UK is due to trigger its departure negotiations.Ivan Rogers, a highly-regarded diplomat who had been due to end his four-year stint in October, stepped down as London prepares to invoke Article 50, which starts a two-year countdown to Britain leaving the EU.Rogers came under fire last month for saying it could take 10 years for Britain to conclude a trade deal with the EU.The government insisted, though, that he was only reporting back what was being said in European capitals.&#8220;Sir Ivan Rogers has resigned a few months early as UK permanent representative to the European Union,&#8221; a British government spokeswoman said.&#8220;Sir Ivan has taken this decision now to enable a successor to be appointed before the UK invokes Article 50 by the end of March. We are grateful for his work and commitment over the last three years.&#8221;London is set to appoint a new ambassador and deputy ambassador shortly.Rogers headed UKRep, the office which represents Britain in negotiations that take place in the EU.In a resignation email to UKRep staff, he urged colleagues to provide British ministers with their &#8220;unvarnished&#8221; understanding through Brexit negotiations &#8212; &#8220;even where this is uncomfortable&#8221;.&#8220;I hope you will continue to challenge ill-founded arguments and muddled thinking and that you will never be afraid to speak the truth to those in power,&#8221; Rogers said.He also criticised the British government for its short supply of &#8220;serious multilateral negotiating experience&#8221; in London and said the structure of the UK&#8217;s negotiating team &#8220;needs rapid resolution&#8221;.&#8211; Concerns over timing &#8211;&#8220;His resignation is not a surprise for those who work with him,&#8221; a European diplomat told AFP.&#8220;He was very competent, but not convinced by the Brexit decision and the British government line, leading the UK into an area of dangerous uncertainty.&#8221;In the June 2016 referendum, 52 percent voted for Britain leave the EU.Triggering Article 50 will start a two-year countdown after which Britain will leave all the institutions and the single market unless alternative arrangements have been agreed.Hilary Benn, who chairs parliament&#8217;s Brexit scrutiny committee, told BBC radio the resignation was &#8220;not a good thing&#8221;.&#8220;The hard work is going to start very soon,&#8221; he said.&#8220;And having a handover in the middle of that, depending on when exactly he goes, is not ideal.&#8221;Rogers had been in his post since November 2013, having previously served as prime minister David Cameron&#8217;s Europe adviser since 2011.Aled Williams, the former spokesman for Britain&#8217;s EU embassy, said Rogers&#8217; departure was a &#8220;big loss&#8221; to the Brexit negotiations.&#8220;Sir Ivan never sugar-coated his advice: had the credibility to tell his political bosses how he saw it in Brussels,&#8221; he said.The mild-mannered Rogers is widely respected in Brussels where he is known as a vastly experienced operator.Critics accuse of him of being a europhile, but European diplomatic sources described him as being a realist.British diplomatic sources at the time of the leaked &#8220;10 years&#8221; comments voiced suspicions that he may have been knifed in the back by pro-Brexit forces who wanted him out.&#8211; UK ministers &#8216;delude themselves&#8217; &#8211;Peter Mandelson, a British former trade commissioner for the EU, said Rogers was &#8220;second to none&#8221; in terms of knowledge and experience of Brussels.Diplomats were being &#8220;increasingly inhibited in offering objective advice,&#8221; he added.&#8220;Our negotiation as a whole will go nowhere if ministers are going to delude themselves about the immense difficulty and challenges Britain faces,&#8221; he said.But Arron Banks, who chaired the Leave.EU campaign group in the referendum, said Rogers was a &#8220;pessimist&#8221; from the &#8220;pro-EU old guard&#8221;.&#8220;It&#8217;s time now for someone who is optimistic about the future that lies ahead for Brexit Britain. Enough talk, we need to get on with getting out,&#8221; he said.Brexit figurehead Nigel Farage also welcomed the resignation, saying the Foreign Office needed a &#8220;complete clear-out&#8221;.The office of Michel Barnier, the European Commission&#8217;s chief Brexit negotiator, declined to comment.-AFP
