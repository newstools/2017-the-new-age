The South African Football Players Union (Safpu) and football agents have called for Fifa to adapt the PSL s Dispute Resolution Chamber (DRC) to an independent, neutral and transparent body.The local football union issued this statement in the wake of Keagan Dolly losing his case against his club, Mamelodi Sundowns, which he had lodged with the DRC.The appeal s body is made up of PSL employees and this has infuriated the union and agents, who feel this constitution renders a platform that should seek fair discourse biased.In fact, the union said it wrote to Fifa about six months ago and also made PSL chairperson Irvin Khoza aware of their unhappiness about the make-up of the DRC. Neutral people need to be appointed to the DRC. They are appointed by the PSL. It should be someone appointed by all the parties involved, Safpu president Tebogo Monyai said.Agent Josiah Mphono described the latest development as a case study for all agents and business managers whose clients have contracts with teams that could be changed afterwards .Sundowns amended the contract last year and by their own admission, made a mistake by changing the buyout to a mere R10.5m.Upon realising the error, Sundowns took the matter to the DRC and this was challenged by Dolly and his representatives. Sundowns are merely buying time because they don t have a replacement for Dolly if they let him go. You saw what happened when Leonardo Castro was not playing, they struggled a bit. One wonders what the president (Patrice Motsepe) is going to say about this noise because he does not want his team s name to be dragged in the mud, an agent, who asked not to be named, said.About a decade ago, Motsepe fired then CEO Afzal Khan after striker Jose Torrealba sought to leave the club but Khan objected that he still had a contract with Sundowns. The South American striker s agent took the club to the DRC and won.Meanwhile, Dolly alongside Sundowns teammates Khama Billiat and Denis Onyango ensured South Africa was well represented last night at the Glo-CAF award ceremony in Abuja, Nigeria, where they made it into the continent s team of the year line-up.The Brazilians championship winning CAF Champions League campaign of 2016 saw their coach Pitso Mosimane vying for the Coach of the Year award, while his players Onyango and Billiat were in the running for Player of the Year award for players based on the African continent.LINDA XIMBAnews@thenewage.co.za
