Former US president George H.W. Bush, patriarch of a dynastic political family, is in a hospital recovering from a mild case of pneumonia, his office said Tuesday.The 41st president, age 92, &#8220;was admitted to Houston Methodist Hospital on Friday for observation due to a persistent cough that prevented him from getting proper rest,&#8221; the office said in a statement released by Bush spokesman Jim McGrath.Doctors later determined Bush had a mild case of pneumonia, &#8220;which was treated and has been resolved,&#8221; the statement said.&#8220;President Bush is in very good spirits and is being held for further observation while he regains his strength.&#8221;Bush, who suffers from Parkinson&#8217;s disease which has left him in a wheelchair, spent two weeks in January in the same hospital where he was treated for bacterial pneumonia.Bush served as US commander-in-chief from 1989 to 1993, and is the oldest of the five living former US presidents.He is father to former president George W. Bush (2001-2009) and former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who was a contender in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries.-AFP
