&#8220;I still feel like I had to do it,&#8221; he told jurors in a closing argument at the sentencing phase of the trial.The 22-year-old, who was representing himself, has never expressed any remorse in his trial for the June 2015 massacre at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in downtown Charleston that shocked the nation.A Bible study group at &#8220;Mother Emanuel&#8221; had just begun its closing prayer when the self-avowed Nazi and Ku Klux Klan sympathizer opened fire, killing nine people ranging in age from 26 to 87.It took the jury just two hours to convict him last month of all 33 federal hate crime charges against him.The same jury is now tasked with deciding whether to sentence him to death or life in prison. Roof is representing himself in this phase, against the advice of his lawyers and the judge.&#8220;Only one of you has to disagree with the other jurors,&#8221; he said, referring to the life sentence he would receive if the jury is not able to unanimously agree on the death penalty.In a closing argument that lasted for two hours, prosecutor Jay Richardson urged jurors to sentence Roof to death for &#8220;this cold, calculated, malicious killing.&#8221;&#8220;Not one tear did he shed for those that he killed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Unrepentant. No remorse.&#8221;-AFP
