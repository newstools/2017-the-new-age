Passengers on an Australian domestic flight left the plane via an emergency exit Tuesday after a man allegedly left a threatening note in the toilet in what appears to be a prank.The 42 passengers on the Virgin Australia service from Sydney to the rural town of Albury in southeastern Australia were ordered out of the window exit onto the tarmac.&#8220;Albury police received information that a note was located on an item in the toilets of an aircraft en route to Albury,&#8221; police said in a statement.&#8220;About 9.30am the aircraft landed and police boarded the plane and immediately evacuated the passengers.&#8221;Police did not say what was written on the note but said it was not terrorism-related.A 30-year-old man was charged with threatening the lives of passengers with false information.&#8220;There was no terrorism involved at all,&#8221; a New South Wales police spokesman told AFP. Nerves are frayed in Australia after a terror-related siege in Melbourne on Monday.&#8220;I think it was just something silly that he did and there was no real intention there.&#8220;The police managed to get all the passengers out and arrest the guy within five minutes of the plane landing.&#8221;He was granted conditional bail and is due to appear in court next month.Sydney retiree Wendy Willett, who was sitting opposite the man, described the ordeal as &#8220;terrifying&#8221; with a flight attendant shouting &#8220;Evacuate, evacuate! Leave all your belongings, jump out the window.&#8221;&#8220;It was really scary, I was worried I wouldn t be able to jump, but they said the police would help and catch us, which they did,&#8221; she told the Sydney Daily Telegraph.On Monday police shot dead a man after he killed another man and took a women hostage in a Melbourne siege incident being treated as terror-related.In an incident last week, security forces stormed a grounded Malaysia Airlines flight at Melbourne airport when a man tried to enter the cockpit claiming he had a bomb.A Sri Lankan student, who had just been released from psychiatric care, was arrested after several passengers overpowered him mid-flight.-AFP
