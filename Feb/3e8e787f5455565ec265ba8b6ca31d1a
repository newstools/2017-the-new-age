Nearly a month since his abduction in Syria, plans to locate and rescue South African photojournalist Shiraaz Mohamed are ongoing according to aid group Gift of the Givers.Nor has there been proof of life for the 38 year old who was captured by an unknown group near the Syrian border early last month.An unidentified armed group kidnapped him as he was preparing to leave the war torn nation.Gift of the Givers Imtiaz Sooliman said that they were informed that raids would take place in Syria in a bid to locate Mohamed. He said that civilians have also expressed their unhappiness about his capture, calling for his immediate and safe release. We have received word that there will be a rounding up of suspects, arrests, investigations and raids into different areas in an attempt to find Shiraaz. This process has already commenced. Various prisons will be visited in the days ahead to ascertain if Shiraaz has been wrongfully detained, he said.Sooliman said that awareness about his ordeal was being raised in Syria. To assist this process we have put up large posters at our hospital that treats 13000 patients per month. Presently, the hospital is packed to capacity. The message is conciliatory, in essence asking for Shiraaz to be released in a safe place and in return we will look the other way, taking no further action, he said.Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco) spokesperson Nelson Kgwete said that no progress had been made regarding Mohamed s plight.Mohamed joins a list of South Africans who have been held in foreign countries against their will.Stephen McGowan was kidnapped on November 25, 2011 in Timbuktu, Mali.
