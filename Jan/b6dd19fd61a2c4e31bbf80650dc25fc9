Marius Fransman, refreshed after a pilgrimage to Cuba where he visited the grave of Fidel Castro, returns to the public eye today when his Cape Forum launches its series of public lectures.Although the forum plans to organise a lecture once a month, it will hold two this month, starting with today s inaugural lecture and followed by one that will analyse the speech Donald Trump will make after he is sworn in as the 45th US president on January 20.Fransman, who arrived from Cuba yesterday morning, was bubbling about his visit. I ve just returned from visiting the gravesite of Fidel Castro. Last year was a very challenging year for my family and I, he said.A year ago, Fransman was chairperson of the ANC in the Western Cape and on his way to attend the party s 104th birthday celebrations in Rustenberg. But his world was upended when Louisa Wynand accused him of sexual harassment during the road trip to Rustenburg.Her accusations started a nightmare year, which ended with Fransman appealing a decision by the ANC disciplinary committee to recommend he be suspended for five years.That matter will be dealt with this year. Until it has been finalised, Fransman s political life in the ANC is on hold.He will not be at Orlando Stadium on Sunday as part of an ANC rally and listening to Jacob Zuma presenting the movement s president s traditional January 8 speech.Because of this, his Cuban visit and the act of laying a wreath at the gravesite of the country s first president, in Santiago De Cuba on New Year s day, were important to him. It was a deeply political, spiritual and personal experience, he said.While he has been in limbo, Fransman started a series of engagements with communities to make sense of what was happening in South Africa, Africa and the rest of the world.The result was the formation of the Cape Forum, which has been described as a progressive non-governmental organisation founded expressly to promote nonsectarian dialogue among various structures and individuals.According to a press statement, the Cape Forum seeks to create avenues for engagement with African and southern African governments and corporate players, especially those working towards consolidating post-independence gains and to engage proactively to promote human rights, sovereignty and development for the people of the south .Today the first Cape Forum speaker is Dikgang Phillip Makgalemele, a member of the Botswana parliament and Assistant Minister of Health and Wellness in the Cabinet of President Ian Khama.According to the Cape Forum, Makgalemele has been most active and prolific in championing policies that seek to bring long-term sustainable development to the African people and to ensure that the government policies are properly aligned with development needs and initiatives on the ground .DENNIS CRUYWAGENnews@thenewage.co.za
