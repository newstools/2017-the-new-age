The Stormers have appointed flanker Siya Kolisi as their captain for the upcoming Super Rugby season, with lock Eben Etzebeth picked to be his deputy.The 25-year-old Springbok flanker, who has been with the Stormers since 2012, playing a total of 76 Super Rugby matches, described Robbie Fleck s decision as humbling and a great honour. There have been some great players who have led the DHL Stormers out at Newlands, so for me to be among them is both a great privilege and a great responsibility, Kolisi said. With the support of Eben and the rest of the senior players in the squad, I am confident that we can create something special that our fans can be proud of. Fleck appointed centre Juan de Jongh, and prop Frans Malherbe to lead the team last season, but had to pick a new captain after De Jongh picked up an injury that will keep him out of action for about 12 weeks.Kolisi s first assignment will be in a blockbuster clash against the Bulls at Newlands this Saturday in what will be their opening Super Rugby match of the season.There is no doubt that his captaincy role will give Kolisi increased confidence ahead of the international rugby season.Etzebeth is confident that the new leadership changes at the team will help the Stormers do well this season, especially after they could only manage an appearance in the quarterfinals last season, where they were beaten at home by the Chiefs. Siya and I have played together for a long time and I am honoured to stand beside him as we look to take the Stormers to the next level, Etzebeth said.Fleck s side were one of the most promising SA sides in Super Rugby last year, finishing third on the overall standings with 10 wins from 15 matches.Only the Lions, who went on to play in the final, losing out to eventual champions, the Hurricanes, proved to be better than the Cape Town men all of last season.MMASEKEPE MATSEBANE| mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
