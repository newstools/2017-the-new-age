Japan on Saturday launched an H-2A rocket carrying a geo-positioning satellite into orbit after a week-long delay, the government said.The launch of Japan&#8217;s third geo-positioning satellite is part of its plan to build a version of the U.S. global positioning system (GPS) to offer location information used for auto-piloting and possible national security purposes.The government postponed the launch a week ago because of a technical glitch.&#8220;With the success of the third satellite, we have made another step closer for having signals from four satellites in the future,&#8221; Masaji Matsuyama, minister in charge of space policy, said in a statement.The government plans to launch a fourth satellite by the end of the year to start offering highly precise position information by next April.Japan plans to boost the number of its geo-positioning satellites to seven by 2023, making its system independently operational even if the U.S. GPS becomes unavailable for some reason, a government official said previously.The satellite was manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric Corp and was blasted into orbit by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.-Reuters
