Donald Trump thinks Chinese President Xi Jinping is &#8220;putting pressure&#8221; on North Korea, the US president said in an interview to air Sunday, as tensions mount over Pyongyang&#8217;s nuclear and missile programs.If North Korea carries out a nuclear test &#8220;I would not be happy,&#8221; Trump told the CBS television network&#8217;s &#8220;Face the Nation&#8221; program.&#8220;And I can tell you also, I don&#8217;t believe that the president of China, who is a very respected man, will be happy either,&#8221; Trump said in excerpts of the interview released Saturday.Asked if &#8220;not happy&#8221; signified &#8220;military action,&#8221; Trump answered: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I mean, we&#8217;ll see.&#8221;North Korea test-fired a missile over the weekend in apparent defiance of a concerted US push for tougher international sanctions to curb Pyongyang&#8217;s nuclear weapons ambitions.The latest launch, which South Korea said was a failure, came just hours after US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned the UN Security Council of &#8220;catastrophic consequences&#8221; if the international community &#8212; most notably China &#8212; failed to pressure the North into abandoning its weapons program.Trump assailed the failed launch as a show of disrespect toward its ally China.&#8221;North Korea disrespected the wishes of China &amp; its highly respected President when it launched, though unsuccessfully, a missile today. Bad!&#8221; Trump wrote on Twitter.North Korea is seeking to develop a long-range missile capable of hitting the US mainland with a nuclear warhead.China, Pyongyang&#8217;s number one trade partner, has repeatedly called for a return to talks on denuclearization but has been reluctant to use economic pressure that could destabilize North Korea.-AFP
