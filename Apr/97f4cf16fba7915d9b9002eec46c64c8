The EFF has written to the Speaker of National Assembly requesting that next weeks Motion of no confidence debate be postponed pending the outcomes of the United Democratic Movement (UDM) Concourt application to have the vote conduct via a secret ballot.On Tuesday the Concourt granted the UDM access to the court to bring an application which seeks to compel parliament to have a secret ballot to used in the motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma.According to the Concourt directive parties wishing to oppose the UDM application must file their arguments by Thursday, 13 April while the UDM must file its reply by next week Wednesday 19 April.All parties must file their written submissions by next week Friday, 21 April.SUCCESS! #UDM wins round one, #ConCourt will hear our application pic.twitter.com/FsFv9p6Kx6 Bantu Holomisa (@BantuHolomisa) April 11, 2017Last week speaker of parliament Baleka Mbete announced that the motion of no confidence debate will take place next week Tuesday, 18 April.The EFF has now requested that the UDM&#8217;s application run its course before the motion is debated in the National Assembly.&#8221; The EFF holds the view that the outcomes of the Constitutional Court have a direct bearing on the possible nature and outcome of the motion of no confidence.&#8221;&#8221; We therefore make a rational request that the speaker must postpone the sitting on the 18th of April 2017 to a date that will be decided after the constitutional court hearing and decision,&#8221; writes EFF Chief Whip Floyd Shivambu.

Only the sponsor can ask for postponement https://t.co/BG7YO0ssEs Moloto Mothapo (@MolotoMothapo) April 11, 2017Meanwhile Parliament has clarified that it will not be opposing the UDM application.&#8220;&#8230;with regard to whether motions of this nature ought to be conducted by way of a secret vote, the Speaker of the National Assembly holds no position on the matter.&#8221;&#8221; Where the Speaker and the UDM disagree is in relation to the powers of the Speaker under the Constitution to make such a determination.&#8221; said parliament spokesperson Moloto Mothapo in a statement.Parliament has however also stated that Section 102 of the Constitution makes no provision for voting to be conducted through a secret ballot and that the rules of the National Assembly do not provide for secret voting.The Concourt has yet to set a date for when it will hear the UDM application.-TNA Reporter
