Ben Ryan, the Englishman who coached Fiji to Olympic Rugby Sevens gold, has defended Italy&#8217;s no-ruck tactic in Sunday&#8217;s Six Nations game at Twickenham and accused England coach Eddie Jones of double standards.England&#8217;s World Cup-winning coach Clive Woodward was also an enthusiastic supporter of what he described as &#8220;guerrilla warfare&#8221; and said Italy should be applauded.England won the game 36-15 but the issue that dominated the match and its aftermath was Italy&#8217;s innovative tactic of not forming a ruck at the tackle, allowing their players to obstruct the hosts&#8217; attempts to move the ball without being offside.England, who had never lost to Italy in 22 previous matches, were flummoxed and trailed 10-5 at halftime, but they ran in five tries after the interval and finished strongly to secure a comfortable victory.Jones said it was &#8220;not rugby&#8221; and that fans should get their money back.&#8220;If your halfback can&#8217;t pass the ball, there&#8217;s something wrong with the game. If the 10 can&#8217;t see the ball, how do you play rugby?,&#8221; the Australian said.Ryan, who used the approach himself when coach of England&#8217;s Sevens team, said he was flabbergasted by Jones s reaction.&#8220;It is called coaching, Eddie,&#8221; Ryan told The Times. &#8220;It is another defensive strategy, but it is easy enough to counter if you have some nous. I was amazed at his comments. He is being quite rude to people, fellow coaches who outmanoeuvred him.&#8221;Italy coach Conor O Shea made a strong defence of the approach, saying his team did not intend to just keep turning up, do the same thing and get beaten.&#8220;Conor and Brendan (Venter, Italy&#8217;s South African defence coach who came up with the strategy) are working bloody hard, they don t need a fellow coach to say their tactics are akin to underarm bowing,&#8221; Ryan said.&#8220;It is not bad sportsmanship. It is a tactic. Good on Italy. We haven t seen England doing anything different at all.&#8220;When Eddie said it s not rugby, I say what s not rugby is the judo rolling people at rucks and mauls that he does. His comments are littered with double standards when they are doing judo training.&#8221;Woodward wrote in the Daily Mail: &#8220;I totally support Italy and their use of their innovative and inspired tactics.&#8220;It was one of those rare moments in test rugby that makes you sit bolt upright in your seat and think, &#8216;Wow, this is different, this is new. What on earth do England do next?&#8217;&#8220;It was behind the lines literally guerrilla war and I found it compulsive viewing. It&#8217;s what David always has to do if he is to stand any chance against Goliath,&#8221; Woodward added. &#8220;It was a very gutsy and clever, if ultimately unsuccessful, response from a wounded Italy side that felt under pressure.&#8221;World Rugby, the sport&#8217;s governing body, said on Monday there were no immediate plans to address the laws relating to the issue, adding that individual unions could request clarification.-Reuters
