With the England series to follow in May, there are concerns over the form of Proteas top order batsmen, especially in the longer format of the game.Coach Russell Domingo has already expressed concerns about Hashim Amla, Steven Cook, JP Duminy and Temba Bavuma in the series against New Zealand. The series was concluded this morning with South Africa needing to bat the whole day (last night) to save the Test and win the series 1-0, while New Zealand needed just five wickets to level it at 1-1.The Proteas resumed early this morning with Quinton de Kock and captain Faf du Plessis at the crease. However, the concern throughout the series has been the performance of the Proteas top six batsmen, which has been disappointing. Only Dean Elgar and De Kock have managed to score a decent amount of Test runs.Elgar scored 140 in the first innings in the first Test and 89 in the second innings but failed to replicate the same performance in the following two matches. In the second and third Test, he scored only a total of 36 runs. Elgar s partner Cook had a disappointing series, having scored only 17 runs in four innings and was dropped for the last Test with Theunis de Bruyn taking his place to contribute only 12 runs.Duminy, whose place in the team is under threat, didn t make things easy for himself as he also struggled for runs. Duminy scored 104 runs in the series while Bavuma, whose place is also in doubt, didn t do too badly with two half-centuries in the series (64 and 89) and finished with 189 runs. Amla s struggle for runs continued in New Zealand, finishing the series with 153 runs in six innings.The Proteas travel to England in May where they will play three ODIs before the ICC Champions Trophy in July. The four Test series will be played after the Champions Trophy in July, also in England, and Domingo will hope that by then the players will be back at their best.-Neville Khoza|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
