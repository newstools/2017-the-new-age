There is never a dull moment on social media, especially when rapper AKA and Bonang Matheba are involved.The two lovebirds are on holiday in Thailand and reports by a local publication claim that the two have spent about R100000 on their holiday, which obviously has social media in a knot. The rapper responded to the publication s claims by saying that the amount it mentioned did not even cover their flight costs. This really added fuel to the fire on social media and subsequently hit some nerves and was also made worse by AKA s response to a Twitter follower who criticised their spending and his comment on the reports. Twitter user @NobsMathaba said: It s so sad how you think the amount of money you spend gives you value as a person, this says nothing about you&#8230; We don t gaf. It was this tweet that prompted AKA to come out guns blazing. If nobody gives a f**k why is drum investigating &amp; why are you tweeting? Just because your man took you to Warmbaths for vacay &#8230; nxaaa, AKA said on Twitter. As for the little known Limpopo town of Warmbaths comment, it had hundreds of social media users in a frenzy with others defending the destination, saying many South Africans go there for their holidays. There were those who were hardly bothered by the nasty comments and took it in their stride with some funny tweets and memes to go with it. In a tone of reconciliation, the One Time hit maker said that BelaBela (located in Limpopo) is not all that bad. &nbsp;NONTOKOZO GXUMISA | nontokozog@thenewage.co.za
