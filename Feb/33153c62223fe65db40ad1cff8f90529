Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who turns 93 on Tuesday, has no plans to give up power, saying he has no &#8220;acceptable&#8221; successor in place.&#8220;The call to step down must come from my party, my party at congress, my party at central committee,&#8221; Mugabe said in excerpts from a radio broadcast that will air this week and that were printed in the state-owned Sunday Mail newspaper.&#8220;But then what do you see? It&#8217;s the opposite. They want me to stand for elections.&#8221;&#8220;The majority of the people feel that there is no replacement, a successor who to them is acceptable, as acceptable as I am,&#8221; he added.Mugabe, who has kept an iron grip on power since Zimbabwe declared independence in 1980, has repeatedly denied reports of health problems.-AFP
