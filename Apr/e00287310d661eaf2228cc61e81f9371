African People s Convention (APC) leader Themba Godi said black people must not be misled by people who are against transformation.Godi was speaking in Tshwane ahead of the National Day of Action protest against President Jacob Zuma. He said some racists who are standing up to protest, don t want to be governed by black people. We can t have people who are against transformation, who have land, ill-treating people in the farms yet they are the reason why the majority of the people are in so much poverty, Godi added.Opposition parties have come out united in organising the mass action protest to force President Zuma out of office. Have requested a motion of no confidence debate against the president which was scheduled to take place on the 18th of April next week in the National Assembly but United Democratic Movement (UDM) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have since requested a postponement.APC leader also highlighted that, the party s main focus was to mobilise and conscientise the people of the country and make sure that they were able to stand up for their own rights. Our main focus is to mobilisation and conscientisation of our people to stand up on their own rights. Our issues are not of personalities, but that of policies and policies that benefits the poor, Godi said.Meanwhile, Congress of The People Leader Mosiuoa Lekota, questioned African National Congress (ANC) caucus leader Jackson Mthembu s stance on compelling members of his caucus to vote against the tabled motion by the opposition parties.Lekota said it is wrong for ANC MP s to vote with somebody (President) who broke oath of office. How can you compel man and woman to vote for somebody who broke oath of office? We have approached the courts to make a declaratory to explain to MP s that, whoever votes against the motion will have to answer to the people, he added.-Sipho Jack
