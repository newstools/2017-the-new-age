A FAMILY from Northcliff is fearing the worst following strong indications that three bodies found burnt beyond recognition may be that of their missing relatives.The ghastly sight of the three deceased was discovered near the Copper Leaf Estate in Centurion yesterday morning by patrol officers. The family, who refused to be named, are today expected to go through the painful process of DNA testing and identification at a mortuary in Pretoria.It is believed the bodies may be that of two women and a man kidnapped from their home on Sunday evening. Despite believing the description fits that the kidnapped victims, a police officer at the scene said only DNA tests could confirm their identity.The family were kidnapped from their home by unknown people during a house robbery. Erasmia police said the patrol officers noticed a fire in the veld and went to investigate, only to find three unidentified bodies burning about 2.30am.A relative said they heard the news through the media and then made their way to the scene. However, by the time they got to the scene the bodies had already been taken to the mortuary. A family member told The New Age that the three were bundled into the family Mercedes-Benz which is still missing. The description fits that of my brother s wife, her brother and my niece, the family member said, before asking police if there was any sort of jewellery that could have been left behind to help in identifying the bodies.The relative said the man was 56, the girl 22 and the older woman 56 years old. I suspect that because of her tiny features she could have been mistaken for a young child, the family member said.KUTULLO MADISHA
