The City of Cape Town on Monday said the MyCiTi bus service will be suspended from Wednesday due the nation wide bus strike.&#8220;No MyCiTi buses will be operating and commuters are requested in advance to please make alternative arrangements,&#8221; the City of Cape Town said.A thousand bus drivers are set to down tools on Wednesday in a strike that can cripple services across the country.This comes after trade unions Numsa, Satawu and Towu served employers with a 60 hour notice to go on a nationwide strike.&#8220;We regret the inconvenience caused and the additional pressure it places on commuters to make alternative travel arrangements.The strike will have a serious knock-on effect on all public transport and road-based traffic as nearly 71 000 commuters make use of the MyCiTi service on any given weekday,&#8221; City s Mayoral Committee Member for Transport and Urban Development, Councillor Brett Herron said.&nbsp;Unions are seeking a 12% increase across all boards while employers are only offering 7.5%. And they are also demanding for better working conditions.There has been negotiations with the unions and organisations, representing 16 bus companies, since January but remained deadlocked.Golden Arrow bus services have confirmed that they have been served with a strike notice for action.The company has instituted a lockout and all operations will be suspended as of Wednesday until further notice.-TNA Reporter
