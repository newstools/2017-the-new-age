WITH the Proteas Test players set to leave for New Zealand, Highveld Lions opener Stephen Cook said it was important for them to get their Momentum One Day Cup competition off to a perfect start on Sunday.The Lions defeated the Warriors by 44 runs in their opening match on Sunday and are now focused on their clash with the Dolphins on Friday in their second match of the competition. Cook will be playing his last match against the Dolphins in Durban before he departs for the Test series against New Zealand on Saturday night.He will be joined by teammate Temba Bavuma on the flight to New Zealand. After he chipped in with a handy 84 runs from 81 balls, Cook was pleased with how they started their title defence. It is vital that you get off to a winning start, especially with how the national tours are going and how they are going to be changed in the personnel as we go through the competition, Cook said. The Test guys are going to leave and the one day players will come back. When teams are changing, you can t take form for granted. While you have a team that you know you have for the couple of games you have to try to make that count. We are really pleased with how the boys have started off. Probably not enough credit has been given to our bowlers, a really young, inexperienced attack and the way they have held their nerves under pressure. Yes it helps to have runs on the board but they held their nerves against the good players. With Reeza Hendricks scoring a century against the Warriors on Sunday, it seems the Lions won t miss Cook too much when he leaves. Reeza seemed to score quickly without taking a lot of risks and that s the sign of a very good limited overs player. nevillek@thenewage.co.za-Neville Khoza
