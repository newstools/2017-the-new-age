Kenya&#8217;s Supreme Court on Friday declared the results of last month&#8217;s presidential poll &#8220;invalid, null and void&#8221; and ordered the election be re-run within 60 days.&#8220;The presidential election held on August 8 was not conducted in accordance with the constitution,&#8221; said Chief Justice David Maraga, ruling in favour of the opposition which challenged the declaration of President Uhuru Kenyatta as the winner.AFP
