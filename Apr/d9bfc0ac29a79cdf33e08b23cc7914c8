THE Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) has welcomed the sentence handed down to a taxi driver caught attempting to bribe a traffic officer and expressed hope that it would serve as a deterrent to other would-be offenders.RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane said the 25-year-old driver found guilty by the Aliwal North Magistrate s Court had offered a R90 bribe to a traffic officer in December 2016 while travelling from Johannesburg. He was fined R4000 or two years imprisonment. The fine and term of imprisonment were suspended for three years and he was ordered to pay R450 immediately, Zwane said. The RTMC commends traffic officer Fulton Slinger of the Eastern Cape traffic department for the arrest and successful prosecution of the case. He said the agency was planning to deploy its national anti-corruption unit in an attempt to root out bribery and corruption. It is unfortunate that this motorist will, as a consequence of this criminal record, find it difficult to get employment. This should send a message to motorists that bribing traffic law enforcement officers is a crime. Motorists should heed that warning this Easter and abide by the rules of the road. Zwane said four motorists who offered bribes to avoid tickets for speeding were also nabbed during the same period. During this period, Slinger arrested four motorists who tried to offer him bribes to avoid consequences for speeding and possessing fraudulent documentation. Equally so, officer Slinger continues to be a shining example of a morally upright and ethical traffic officer who we are proud to have in the fraternity. Numerous arrests involving traffic officials and motorist implicated in bribery and corruption were made in recent months. In February, a Tshwane metro police officer was found guilty of soliciting a R100 bribe. Sebo Mathabatha pleaded guilty after demanding a bribe from an undercover agent of the national traffic anticorruption unit. 701233
