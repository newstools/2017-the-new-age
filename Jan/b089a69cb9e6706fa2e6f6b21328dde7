Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan is still waiting on the South African Revenue Service for an explanation of the hostage drama which played out at its headquarters last October.In a written reply to a parliamentary question, Gordhan expressed his confidence in the SARS employee, Vlok Symmington, who was involved in the incident.In another reply to a different written question, Gordhan said SARS had indicated to him it had not launched a new anti-corruption and security unit and that neither were there plans to start such a unit. The Ministry of Finance cannot verify its accuracy, he said.On the incident in October Gordan said: The Minister of Finance was not informed by the South African Revenue Service regarding this matter. The Minister of Finance has not been provided with any formal explanation by SARS on this matter. The deputy director of law administration at SARS, Symington advised Gordan when he headed SARS that there was nothing illegal about Ivan Pillay taking early retirement and then being given a contract.It appears that the Hawks when pursuing charges which have since been dropped against Gordhan last year did not take this crucial bit of information into account in their probe.On October 27, Hawks officials, as well as the personal bodyguard of SARS commissioner Tom Moyane, allegedly held Symington against his will in a boardroom at SARS offices. They wanted him to sign an affidavit.After his ordeal, Symington laid a case of kidnapping and theft at the Brooklyn police station in Thswane. He also filed a complaint with the Independent Police Investigative Directorate. What has appeared in the public domain is completely unacceptable. Mr Symington is a person of great expertise and a person of integrity that I have worked with for many years, Gordhan said about the incident.DENNIS CRUYWAGENnews@thenewage.co,za
