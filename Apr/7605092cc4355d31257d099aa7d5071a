The government hailed Solomon Mahlangu as a dedicated freedom fighter who paid the ultimate price in his quest to free the country from the shackles of apartheid.President Jacob Zuma opened the Third Presidential Local Government Summit in Midrand yesterday with a special tribute to Mahlangu. We meet today on an important day on which we commemorate the tragic execution of Solomon Mahlangu by the apartheid state in 1979. On this solemn occasion we recall his last words: My blood will nourish the tree that will bear the fruits of freedom. Tell my people that I love them. They must continue the fight . Zuma said the execution of Mahlangu provoked widespread international outrage. Today, in his honour, the fight continues, this time to accelerate economic transformation and improve the lives of our people, he said.Meanwhile, the Deputy Minister of Correctional Services, Thabang Makwetla, traditional leaders, the Mahlangu family, Cosas and ANC members gathered in Tshwane to remember the struggle hero.The family members visited the gallows at Pretoria Central Prison, now known as Kgosi Mampuri II Correctional Centre, where he was hanged.They proceeded to the Mamelodi West graveyard where they laid wreaths at his grave.Family member Gideon Mahlangu said it was a day to celebrate the life of his uncle and the sacrifice he made for the country and the people of Mamelodi. The young people of this country must know that this democracy was born out of great sacrifices by young freedom fighters like Solomon, he said. Solomon s execution played an instrumental role for the youth of this country. Mahlangu became a source of inspiration to students. He was a symbol of hope to many of them. Gideon expressed disappointment that the city of Tshwane hosted the state of the city address on a day the rest of the nation commemorated.
