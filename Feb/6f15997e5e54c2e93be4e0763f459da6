A teenaged singer with a transgender sister, best known for performing the U.S. national anthem at President Donald Trump&#8217;s inauguration in January, and reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner have both asked to discuss the issue with him.Jackie Evancho, 16, requested the meeting in a Twitter message late on Wednesday, minutes after the administration revoked landmark guidance to public schools to let transgender students use the bathrooms of their choice.&#8220;I am obviously disappointed in the @POTUS decision to send the #transgender bathroom issue to the states to decide. #sisterlove,&#8221; she wrote from her account, @jackieevancho.Trump &#8220;gave me the honor&#8221; of singing at the inauguration, she added in another tweet. &#8220;Pls give me &amp; my sis the honor 2 meet with u 2 talk #transgender rghts.&#8221;On Thursday evening former Olympic gold medalist and transgender activist Jenner also weighed in on social media, telling Trump on Twitter that &#8220;from one Republican to another, this is a disaster&#8221; and asking the president to call her.White House spokesman Sean Spicer, asked at a briefing if Trump would meet with Evancho, said the president would welcome a meeting with her.As of Thursday evening, more than 10,000 Twitter users had liked the request by Evancho, a classical crossover singer who rose to fame on the TV show &#8220;America&#8217;s Got Talent.&#8221;Evancho was the first performer announced for Trump&#8217;s inauguration ceremony, an event that a number of other entertainers shunned because of the president&#8217;s views.Trump, a Twitter user, has not responded to the request, Evancho said on Thursday during an appearance with her sister, Juliet, on ABC&#8217;s &#8220;Good Morning America.&#8221;&#8220;I just want to enlighten him on what my sister &#8211; I&#8217;ve seen her go through every single day in school,&#8221; she said.Juliet Evancho, a high school senior, said the president needed to know about the threats facing students who identify as a gender other than the one with which they were born.&#8220;I&#8217;ve had things thrown at me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had people say pretty horrible things, and the unsafe environment is just very unhealthy.&#8221;The Evancho family is suing Juliet&#8217;s Pittsburgh-area school district over her right to use women&#8217;s bathrooms.The Trump administration&#8217;s action on Wednesday reversed a signature initiative of former president Barack Obama, whose Justice and Education departments had threatened to withhold funding for schools that did not comply with its guidance.-Reuters
