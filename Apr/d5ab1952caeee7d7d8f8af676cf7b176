The World Health Organisation has declared viral hepatitis a major public health challenge, calling for an urgent response to deal with it.According to the WHO Global Hepatitis report 2017, viral hepatitis kills more people than HIV and tuberculosis deaths which are on the decline, while mortality from hepatitis is on the rise. An estimated 325 million people globally are living with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.Many are denied access to testing and treatment putting them at risk of slow progression to chronic liver disease, cancer and death. Viral hepatitis is now recognised as a major public health challenge that requires an urgent response, WHO director-general Dr Margaret Chan said.Viral hepatitis is an infection of the liver. According to the WHO, viral hepatitis caused 1.34 million deaths while about 1.75 million people were newly infected with HCV in 2015.A toal of 71 million people live with hepatitis C worldwide, the report said. Vaccines and medicines to tackle hepatitis exist and WHO is committed to helping ensure these tools reach all those who need them, Chan said.Although overall deaths from hepatitis were on the rise, new HBV infections were declining due to the increase in vaccination of children.The report says 84% of children born in 2015 globally received the three recommended doses of hepatitis B vaccine with 1.7 million people diagnosed with HBV infection being on treatment but only 1.1 million of those diagnosed with HCV infection starting treatment in 2015. Its unknown how many South Africans live with hepatitis C.In South Africa key populations such as people who inject drugs, sex workers and men who have sex with men are at a higher risk of contracting viral hepatitis.Last year a partnership between TB/ HIV Care Association, University of Cape Townand the National Institute for Communicable Diseases among other partners, undertook a research project for key populations disproportionately affected by viral hepatitis across seven cities.Director of WHO s department of HIV and the Global Hepatitis Programme Dr Gottfried Hirnschall said: More countries are making hepatitis services available for people in need a diagnostic test costs less than $1 (R13) and the cure for hepatitis C can be below $200.But the data clearly highlights the urgency with which we must address the remaining gaps in testing and treatment, Hirnschall said. 701478-TNA REPORTER
