France relied on the boot of Camille Lopez as they laboured to a 22-16 home win against Scotland in the Six Nations on Sunday.Fly-half Lopez kicked five penalties and converted Gael Fickou&#8217;s try while Scotland&#8217;s points came from tries by Stuart Hogg and Tim Swinson and a couple of Finn Russell penalties.The visitors&#8217; hopes of a first win in Paris since 1999 were undermined when they lost scrum-half Greig Laidlaw to an injury in the first half.France are in fourth place with five points from two games, ahead of Scotland who bagged a bonus point for losing by less than seven points.France next travel to Ireland and Scotland will take on Wales.-Reuters
