The significance of Caster Semenya s recent victory in Oslo has been as much about maintaining an incredible near two-year unbeaten streak as it s been about her grip at the top of the 800m world rankings.The Olympic gold medallist is among six South African athletes, including 800m world champion Wayde van Niekerk and Rio Olympic long-jumper Luvo Man &#8211; yonga, in the top three of their disciplines, heading to the IAAF World Championships. This essentially means the prospects of medals will be great for Team South Africa at the championships in London next month. Semenya stormed to yet another emphatic victory in the 800m event, pipping Francine Niyonsaba at the fifth leg of the IAAF Diamond League series in Oslo as she also maintained her consistent head of steam ahead of the World Championships.Her points tally has gone up to 24 in the Diamond League and she is unlikely to lose her top spot even if the 26 year old defending cham &#8211; pion misses the sixth leg of the series in Sweden this weekend. Running against good com &#8211; petitors over the past few months has really kept me on my toes. I don t have to lose momentum, Semenya said of Burundian Niyonsaba. Niyonsaba and Kenyan Marga &#8211; ret Wamburi, came second and third to her in the 800m at the Rio Olympics and have trailed her at three other international events since.Semenya is yet to lose a race since September 2015, having enjoyed complete dominance of her special &#8211; ist 800m event. This has taken a meticulous juggling act between sports science studies at the Univer &#8211; sity of the North West and time on the track for Semenya. Like Semenya, Van Niekerk is well poised heading to the World Championships.Even though he has yet to enter the top 10 list in the 400m event, as he prepares for his double attempt at the World Champion &#8211; ships, Van Niekerk increased his advantage at the top of the men s 200m rankings with a personal best as he stormed to a 19.84 win in Kingston last week.Antonio Alkana moved clear at the top of the 110m hurdles rat &#8211; ings, smashing the SA record by 0.13 with a 13.11 victory in Prague while sprinter Anaso Jobodwana has continued his steady come &#8211; back from injury by shaving 0.07 off his season s best with a 20.62 performance at the World Chal &#8211; lenge meeting in Hengelo last week.-KGOMOTSO SETHUSHA|kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
