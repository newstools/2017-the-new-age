Rain and snow on the mountains is expected on Sunday. According to Storm Report SA a cold front will be bring much needed rain over the drought-stricken areas of the Western and Northern Cape.The organisation said current weather models suggest that some places could see as much as 80mm of rain, with most rain expected over the south western parts of the Western Cape and the extreme western parts of the Northern Cape.&#8220;Snowfall is also expected over most high peaks of the Western Cape with moderate to heavy falls over Matroosberg and the extreme high peaks. We will send out a snowfall forecast later this week,&#8221; said Storm Report SA .This comes in four days after City of Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille announced that the city would implement a 4B water restriction, reflecting the seriousness of the water shortage facing the city.&#8220;We also expect the tail end of another cold front to hit the Western Cape on Sunday also bringing with it some light to moderate rainfall,&#8221; said Storm Report SA.Western Cape has been declared a disaster area after experiencing its worst drought in the last century. The last experienced a drought between 2004-2005, and while it did implement precautionary measures, the extent of this drought has never been experienced before.&#8220;Let&#8217;s pray that this forecast will come to pass. The Western Cape only have 10% of usable water left and is currently under level 4 water restrictions,&#8221; said Storm Report SA .The South African weather services said although this much rain is expected, the severity of the ongoing water shortage in the Western Cape is such that there will be almost still no relief brought by this weather system on its own. The second cold front, much more potent, will reach Cape Town during late Tuesday night. At this early stage, indications are that there is a high likelihood of widespread rain over the south-western parts of the country, and also potential for heavy rains in some places on Wednesday, said SA weather service.TNA Reporter
