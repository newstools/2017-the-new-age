Lobby group Voice of the Unborn Baby wants to change the law to allow parents to bury their unborn babies if they die in the first 26-weeks of pregnancy.Founding director Sonja Smith believes that current legislation infringes upon the rights of bereaved parents denying them both choice and closure.&#8220;At the moment parents do not have a choice should they want to bury their foetus, Smith said. We are saying not having that choice is an infringement of your basic human rights which is the right to dignity, the right to equality and privacy.&#8221;According to the Births &amp; Deaths Registration Act 51 of 1992, a foetus which died during the first 26 weeks of gestation cannot be issued a burial order &#8211; which in effect prohibits parents from burying or cremating the remains of the foetus.&#8221; The foetus is then regarded as anatomical and surgical medical waste which is then disposed of by means of incineration,&#8221; said SmithHowever, a foetus which died after 26 weeks and showed no sign of life after a complete birth is regarded as still-born and a burial order may be issued.According to Smith, in her founding affidavit, their court bid does not seek to allocate any legal rights to a foetus.They group believes that parents have emotional bonds to their unborn babies.&#8220;This application is grounded on the reality that many expecting parents make a significant emotional investment in their prospective child long before birth and that pregnancy loss consequently has an undeniable negative emotional impact on such bereaved parents,&#8221; the affidavit reads.On Wednesday Voice of the Unborn Baby filed papers in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria. The Ministry of Home Affairs and Health are cited as respondents in the matter and are set to submit answering papers.According to Smith she has not experienced any resistance from government to her application as yet.&#8221; We called for a round table discussion with the ministers involved. They did acknowledge receipt of my letters but we did not get to the round table,&#8221; but she added that Clarence Carter, a former deputy director of the Health D and sent her a draft new policy document which is line with what she is looking for.&#8221; But it s not good enough because it has not changed the legislation it is only a policy,&#8221; said Smith.A look at the Facebook page of Voice of the Unborn Baby shows the cause enjoys widespread support from across the country.People go to the page to share personal stories of loss.Sonja, meanwhile, believes that it does not matter whether the pregnancy was deliberately terminated or not and that their cause does not concern itself with pro-life or pro-choice&#8220;People from all walks of life are faced with pregnancy loss our cause covers the whole scenario of pregnancy whether termination or not. We want to give everybody the right to choose what happens to the foetus.&#8221;&#8221; This is a matter of an archaic law from 1960 which was not brought into line with the constitution of 1996. We are just trying to fix that, said Sonja.-Siphiwe Mchunu
