Five people were killed when their helicopter crashed in poor conditions in a mountainous part of Wales, rescuers said Thursday after a major search operation.Authorities found the wreckage of the privately-owned Twin Squirrel chopper in Snowdonia, a national park in northwest Wales, after it went down en route to Dublin.The bodies are being recovered from what local police said was &#8220;very difficult and challenging terrain&#8221;.&#8220;Local conditions were described as atrocious, with visibility down to less than 10 metres (33 feet) in places,&#8221; said Gareth Evans from the North Wales Police force.&#8220;The terrain where the aircraft has been located is remote and, in places, hazardous.&#8221;He said details of those on board would not be revealed until their bodies had been formally identified, and specialist family liaison officers were supporting the relatives.Evans said a full investigation had been launched and urged people to stay away from visiting the area, a popular tourist spot, in order to facilitate the probe.The Twin Squirrel is a widely used twin-engine light utility helicopter with a reputation for durability and low maintenance.First introduced in the mid-1970s, the all-weather aircraft is used for both civil and military purposes.It has a cruising speed of 140 miles (225 kilometres) per hour and a range of nearly 440 miles.-AFP
