Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi recently defended the party s leader Julius Malema against the criticisms of Malema s lifestyle, his tax case with the South African Revenue Service (SARS), drinking Heineken beer and wearing a Breitling watch, calling them petty attacks.The criticism of Malema s lifestyle stems from the fact that, according to their documents and according to the Cape Chameleon publication, EFF draws its inspiration from the broad Marxist-Leninist theories as well as Fanonian schools of thought in their analysis of the state, imperialism, culture and class contradiction.Their movement is anti-imperialist, anticapitalist and inspired by socialist and communist ideals. The EFF sees itself as the voice of the poorest South Africans, mainly the black community.Braam Hanekom of the Friends of Cuba defined EFF as a gathering of three or four celebrities with a few spin doctors to form a group that aimed to gather disgruntled factionalists who then received a lion s share of opposition political media coverage.No man can deny that the man (Malema) is a celebrity he is funny, entertaining and unpredictable. The media s fixation on celebrity politics often fails to analyse individuals on the way they lead their lives rather than what they say; it is easy to talk left and walk right, Hanekom said.One of the celebrities who founded the EFF made these parting remarks when he was leaving the party: I founded the EFF. One of the reasons that I left is exactly what is happening now in the EFF, the lies the facade that is being put to the people of SA and the world that this is a revolutionary movement and that their leader is a revolutionary man, whereas he is the biggest liar. He has no right to call himself a revolutionary or to even name Fanon Che Guevara and all these revolutionaries who shed their blood in the name of economic revolution. There is no revolutionary left in that Judas. Despite all the criticism, the EFF has grown steadily and continue to receive the lion s share of opposition media coverage.Their greatest prize came at the August 2016 elections when they became the kingmakers in many hung municipalities.The EFF decided to block the ANC s path to reclaiming some key metros and other municipalities. This brought another flood of criticism. Such contradictions were tested again after Helen Zille s colonial defence.The EFF-DA partnership, of coloniser and colonised, became more pronounced. Malema immediately threatened to cut ties with the DA in the metros if they did not deal with Zille. This is a crisis for the EFF, one which may well still see them withdraw their support for the DA.Malema told the DA to stop tiptoeing around Zille but the tiptoeing continued. However, when push came to shove, Malema could not live up to his earlier threats but decided to accept a defeated Maimane s call for Zille to relinquish all her political positions (an odd and empty punishment).The premiership, which if it had been relinquished by Zille, would have been a hard and credible punishment, proved off limits.Why could Malema not go through with his threats to cut ties with the DA in many metros in light of their protection of their racist leader?The simple answer to this is money.Another celebrity who founded the EFF but is now its arch-enemy made some claims that have never been refuted: During October 2015, the top leadership of the ostensible Marxist-Leninist parliamentary party, the EFF led by its commander-in-chief Julius Malema, took a tour to London where they met among others, Lord Robin Renwick. Renwick serves in the House of Lords in the British parliament and has business links to the Rothschilds, the Ruperts and some of the biggest multinational companies in the world, including mining companies in Asia, Europe, Australia and Africa that mine gold, diamonds, copper, coal, natural gas, petroleum etc. It is my opinion that the Rothschilds and Ruperts are the faces of white monopoly capital, who are funding everything white, including the DA.It is not unreasonable to think that the EFF has been extended some largesse in order to keep the DA in power in the metros and protect the white franchise.It is certain that Fanon would have seen in the EFF exactly the pitfalls he continued to warn black people about.Fanon said: In an under-developed country, an authentic national middle class ought to consider as its bounden duty to betray the calling fate has marked out for it and to put itself to school with the people: in other words, to put at the people s disposal the intellectual and technical capital that it has snatched when going through the colonial universities. Besides showing off in Parliament, the EFF have not benefited the poor in any way.Fanon continued by saying: But unhappily we shall see that very often the national middle class does not follow this heroic, positive, fruitful and just path; rather, it disappears with its soul set at peace into the shocking ways shocking because anti-national of a traditional bourgeoisie, of a bourgeoisie which is stupidly, contemptibly, cynically bourgeois. The EFF tried unsustainable methods of raising money, subjecting its new councillors to pay cuts that were cruel and unsustainable, which in the end created bitterness in their ranks, because such sacrifices were not widely shared.Rothschilds and Ruperts came to their rescue and the party lost its soul.Or is it that it was always about the money?Mohamed Khalid SayedMohamed Khalid Sayed is Western Cape s provincial ANCYL chairperson
