Water and Sanitation senior manager in Umsunduzi municipality Brenden Sivparsad has on Thursday confirmed the shutdown of water services in three municipalities in KwaZulu-Natal. Sivparsad said: &#8220;The shutdowns in Umsunduzi, eThekwini and Umgungundlovu municipalities is set to allow Umgeni Water to conduct essential work in order to enhance the assurance of water supply in future. &#8220;Water cuts do not necessarily mean the aforementioned areas will be left without water over the 16 hour period.&#8221; It is reported that Umgeni water will stop production of potable water at the Midmar water works only which supply water to Presbury, upper portions of the CBD, Oribi, Edendale, Ashdown, Willowfoutain and Ashburton to carry out core and warranted maintenance. &#8220;The Msunduzi Municpality in conjunction with Umgeni Water will make every effort and implement all practical measures to ensure that our core reservoirs are filled and stable to ensure minimal disruption to our residents of this period, however exigencies of service might cause unexpected operational disruptions,&#8221; he said. The shutdowns are anticipated to be completed with full recovery of system to all areas by Friday the 27th January 2017 pending any unforeseen circumstances. The municipality has highlighted that the virtue of each areas or districts elevation that certain areas might not be effected by this shutdown whilst higher lying will be more predominate as it will take longer to restore water with full pressure to those areas. The Umsunduzi municipality unreservedly apologises for any inconvenience or lack of supply, our residents can be rest assured that such is only consented to in order to improve our future assurance of supply, said Sivparsad.
