Cosatu CEC has called Minister of Social Development Bathabile Dlamini to resign over the issues at South African Social Security Agency (SASSA). We are appealing to the President to intervene and heads need to roll at SASSA. The Minister and her team need to take political responsibility for the crisis by resigning or be dismissed, said COSATU General Secretary Bheki Ntshalintshali.He added that the Minister and her team have failed to deal with the regular expenditure and the regular tender processes. This is not an administrative issue but a political own goal that smells of corruption, said Ntshalintshali.While briefing the media Ntshalintshali stated that it is concerned about the manner in which the extension of SASSA contract with Cash Paymaster Services(CPS) was handled.Sassa failed to come up with an alternative to a contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS), which has been declared unlawful by the Constitutional Court. The contract ended on March 31.On Wednesday SASSA withdrawn its Constitutional Court application to extend its current illegal contract with Cash Paymaster Services (CPS).The withdrawal comes less than 24 hours after SASSA filed the notice stating that it will be approaching the Concourt for help.However, Minister in the Presidency Jeff Radebe said government is committed to paying beneficiaries on April 1. We are deeply concerned about the SASSA issue but we are committed in ensuring social grants are paid come April, said Radebe.During a post cabinet briefing Radebe told the media that the SASSA matter was raised in the cabinet meeting on Wednesday and a decision was taken that next week a special meeting with the Cabinet committees will be held to discuss the SASSA crisis.-TNA Reporter
