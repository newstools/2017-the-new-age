Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo claimed he had to overcome media &#8220;campaigns&#8221; against him to win FIFA&#8217;s inaugural &#8220;The Best&#8221; prize for the world&#8217;s best player in 2016.Ronaldo lifted the award at a star-studded ceremony in Zurich on Monday after a glittering year on the pitch saw him lead Madrid to Champions League glory and captain Portugal to their first ever major international triumph at Euro 2016.However, Ronaldo&#8217;s year was blighted by reports from an international consortium of media organisations in December that claimed a huge data leak involving 18 million documents showed the Portuguese hid 150 million euros ($160 million) from image rights in the British Virgin Islands.Ronaldo, 31, has strongly denied all claims of wrongdoing.&#8220;There were many doubts, many campaigns against me from inside and outside football,&#8221; Ronaldo told Spanish radio station COPE.&#8220;They wanted to hit me from all sides and the truth is The Best was The Best and that is me, so I am very happy.&#8220;They wanted me to feel bad, but as I have said &#8216;he who owes nothing, fears nothing in life&#8217;. As always, I have shut up a few mouths once again.&#8221;The Spanish tax authorities have committed to investigating the allegations against Ronaldo and a series of other Spanish-based sports stars named in the &#8220;Football Leaks&#8221; investigation.However, the four-time World Player of the Year insists he is calm and believes justice will be done in his favour.&#8220;It bothers me because when you do things well, when you help a lot of people and I am going to mention the award for charity work, which is one of the best awards I have in my museum.&#8220;I have helped so many people and you do so many good things, but people want to hit you to camouflage the bad things that others do.&#8220;It bothered me and it continues to bother me, but justice is always done in the end and so we are going to wait and see what happens.&#8221;-AFP
