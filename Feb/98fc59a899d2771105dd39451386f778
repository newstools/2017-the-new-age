THE DA has called for the suspension of lecturers at the eThekwini Coastal College accused of humiliating a gay student in front of other students.DA eThekwini councillor Martin Meyer said: We believe that lecturers who victimise students for reasons of their sexual orientation should be suspended pending a thorough investigation into the matter. In this case, the college should immediately suspend the lecturers, pending an investigation. This after Bheka Khanyile, 20, a second-year business administration student at the college was kicked out of class after refusing to take off his braids and make-up. Snegugu Dlamini, the college spokesperson, said the matter was being investigated. Disciplinary processes will be initiated should it be found that the college s policies have been violated, she said Meyer said he had met the traumatised student who was at home following the humiliating experience. The DA and the DA Students Organisation, will today meet with the campus manager and will ask for suspensions to be put in place and a timeline for completion of an investigation report, he said.After a lecturer had humiliated him in front of other students for looking like a girl, Khanyile said he had to quit school after the principal had been unsupportive. Nothing was done after I had taken up the matter, he said.Anthony Waldhavfem, director of the Gays and Lesbians Network, said the abuse of LGBTI students in schools was on the increase in the country. Teachers and school officials are often behind the abuse.The government has a long way to go to resolve this issue because it s happening in many schools across the country, he said.Last week the provincial education department had to intervene after the principal of Ndala High School in Richmond expelled a lesbian pupil for wearing a boys uniform. Nokwazi Shelembe, 18, a Grade 12 pupil, was told not to come to school as long as she continued to dress in a boys uniform.CLIVE NDOUprovinces@thenewage.co.za
