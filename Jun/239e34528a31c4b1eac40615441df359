BET apologised to music fans after South African rapper Nasty C was prematurely announced as the winner of the International African Act a week ahead of the official crowning in Los Angeles.The 16th edition of the awards that honour black excellence will take place at the Microsoft Theatre on Sunday. If Nasty C wins the award it will make it two years in a row that a South African act takes this honour after Black Coffee last year.Nasty C s rise in the local music industry has been a controversial topic. Claims of award rigging were levelled against his record label, Mabala Noise, earlier this year when the KZN-born rapper walked away with six Metro FM Music Awards.The 21-year-old rapper is nominated for a BET award alongside AKA, Babes Wodumo, Nigeria s Davido and Wizkid and Ghanaian rapper Stonebwoy. BET organisers have since issued a statement saying the bug occurred as a result of an unforeseen technical error. An unforeseen technical issue on BET.com resulted in several categories revealing randomly selected nominees as winners. We deeply apologise to the artists who were impacted by this error, reads the statement.SIYABONGA SITHOLE
