Eastern Cape cooperative government and traditional affairs (Cogta) MEC Fikile Xasa said the acting head of department of Cogta, Monwabisi Baza, would ensure that the support needed by the Mnquma local municipality s leadership was provided.Xasa encouraged Mnquma leaders to strive to work together in the interests of the residents of Mnquma. If the instability persists, Cogta will take over the municipality in the context of the law. We want to resolve issues permanently, working with all key stakeholders, Xasa said.Xasa, together with Basa and other departmental officials, visited Mnquma over two days to engage key stakeholders in an attempt to restore stability to the troubled municipality.During the visit, Xasa met key stakeholders, including the mayoral committee led by councillor Thobeka Bikitsha, the so-called Troika and the municipal manager Sindile Tantsi.At a meeting, Xasa presented to the Troika an ANC faction which wants to suspend Tantsi an order from the Mthatha High Court issued on January 17.The application was made by Tantsi against Bikitsha and speaker Zibuthe Mnqwazi, interdicting them from interfering in the functioning of the municipality.This comes after pro-Tantsi factions sought to pass a vote of no confidence in Bikitsha, Mnqwazi and chief whip Zakhele Mkiva. Going forward, the court order will form the basis of a road map to bring stability to the municipality. Xasa asked the Troika to share the contents of the court order with internal and external stakeholders. The instability in the municipality is a cause for concern to us and it must come to an end. The principles of good governance must be upheld by all parties in order to run the municipality effectively, said Xasa.Xasa complimented members of the SAPS in the Mbizana area for arresting Lulama Ngezana, 39, popularly known as Lusikisiki, at MaSinenge in Port Shepstone on Wednesday night.Ngezana is a notorious traditional surgeon accused of two counts of murder and one count of illegal circumcision. This is a job well done by members of the SAPS, who worked around the clock to hunt Lusikisiki down to bring him into a court of law. Now he will have has day in court to answer for all the charges against him, Xasa said.Xasa said that those people who circumcise children illegally would face the full might of the law.Ngezana will appear in the Mbizana Magistrate s Court today on two charges of murder, alleged to have been committed in Mzamba and Mpisi.provinces@thenewage.co.zaCHARLOTTE HLANGWANE
