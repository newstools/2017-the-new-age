An Iranian teenager making homemade fireworks for a festival ahead of the Persian New Year blew up his home, killing himself and six other family members, a prosecutor said on Saturday.The house in the northwestern city of Ardebil was flattened by the force of the blast, the city&#8217;s prosecutor general, Naser Atabati, told the judiciary&#8217;s Mizan Online news website.&#8221;Seven were killed, one was severely injured and three others lightly wounded,&#8221; he said.The dead were five teenagers and a middle-aged couple.Fireworks and bonfires traditionally mark the last Wednesday of the Persian year, a fire festival known as Chaharshanbeh-Soori.This year Persian New Year, or Nowruz, falls on the following Tuesday, March 21.It is a pre-Islamic tradition associated with the Zoroastrian religion that is still widely observed, not only in Farsi-speaking areas but also in mainly ethnic Azeri cities like Ardebil.Every year, authorities launch public awareness campaigns about the dangers of fireworks. During last year&#8217;s festival, three people were killed and more than 2,500 injured.This year&#8217;s publicity campaign has called for &#8220;respect&#8221; for 16 firefighters who died battling a blaze in a Tehran highrise in January.-AFP
