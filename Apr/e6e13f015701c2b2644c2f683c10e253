The South African Banking Risk Information Centre (Sabric), yesterday released its card fraud statistics for 2016, reflecting an overall increase in card fraud for 2016.Credit card fraud increased by 13% from R331.4m in 2015 to R374.4m in 2016, with debit card fraud increasing by 3.1% for the same period.The fraud related information utilised in the report was provided by African Bank, alBaraka Bank, Bank of Athens, Barclays Africa Group, Bidvest, Capitec Bank, First National Bank, Investec, Mercantile Bank, Nedbank, Postbank, UBank and Sasfin as well as Standard Bank of South Africa.The statistics used in the report cover the period from January 1 to December 31, 2016.Sabric CEO Kalyani Pillay said that while any increase was of concern to the industry, the ever-evolving sophistication of tactics used by criminals was equally worrying. Criminals will always be on the lookout for gaps and weaknesses in order to defraud victims. Fortunately, Sabric s collaborative model, as well as the robust risk mitigation measures deployed by its members, position the industry perfectly to tackle card fraud, Pillay said.Card fraud is a global phenomenon and locally the most affected provinces were Gauteng, the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal. These were followed by the Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga and North West.In fact, Gauteng, Western Cape and KwaZulu Natal accounted for 85.9% of all credit card fraud.Industry statistics indicate that credit card related card not present (CNP) fraud increased by 18.9% from the previous year and accounts for 66.8% of the losses relating to SA issued credit cards.CNP debit card fraud increased by 4.6% which can be attributed to a wider acceptance of debit cards by online vendors.Sabric urged the public to take protective measures to protect themselves. If you are not familiar with the screen layout of the ATM or if it appears that the machine has been tampered with, do not insert your card. Do not allow anyone to swipe your card on a small black device unknown to you. Never send emails that contain card numbers and expiry dates or disclose this information over the phone, a statement said.Credit card gross fraud losses on SA-issued cards used in South Africa, increased by 21.9% from R147.5m in 2015 to R179.8m in 2016.The banking industry s gross fraud losses due to South African issued credit card fraud increased by 13%, from R331.4m in 2015 to R374.4m in 2016.Cards fraudulently obtained by criminals were used to conduct cash withdrawals at ATMs inside South Africa and 3% of these transactions were credit card related and 62% debit card.South Africa-issued credit cards are frequently used by criminals in neighbouring African countries such as Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Kenya and Lesotho. Most of these transactions are fraudulent cash withdrawals at ATMs. An increase is seen in Mauritius where fraudulent CNP transactions are reported. This emerging trend could relate to the increase in merchants registering their businesses in other countries in order to circumvent rules applicable to South Africa, Sabric said.mtokozisid@thenewage.co.za
