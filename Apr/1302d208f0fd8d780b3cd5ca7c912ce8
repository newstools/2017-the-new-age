The DA has called on Eskom to halt all work related to the nuclear procurement process.This follows a decision of the Western Cape High Court to set aside the determination signed by former minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson in December last year which lays the basis for the nuclear procurement with Russia, South Korea and the United States declaring that they were unlawful and unconstitutional.Last year in October former Minister of Energy Tina Joemat-Pettersson announced Eskom as the preferred procurer of the nuclear build programme which was followed by Eskom in December releasing its request for information document (RFI) which is done in order to source information which may assist with the preparation of future competitive tender/enquiry relating to the new nuclear build programme.However the DA has now called on Eskom to abandon all nuclear programme related work.&#8220;The DA will now work to ensure that Eskom halts all work on the nuclear procurement process and will seek to guarantee that no Request for Proposal (RFP) is issued. Any attempts by Eskom to subvert the decision of the court will be challenged by the DA,&#8221; said the DA&#8217;s Shadow Minister of Energy, Gordon Mackay.Eskom has previously stated that it has started to train at least 100 artisans, technicians and engineers as nuclear operators in preparations for the future build of its 9.6GW nuclear power stations.Eskom was also set to bear the cost of the nuclear build programme according to Joemat-Pettersson&#8217;s announcement made to Parliament s energy portfolio committee.Eskom has said it was studying the judgment before commenting.The DA further welcomed Wednesday&#8217;s court ruling saying it was a victory for South Africans.Opposition party the Congress of the People (COPE) have also welcomed the court ruling saying that South Africans must be involved in the nuclear decision making process.&#8220;COPE supports that people of this country must also be involved when these nuclear decisions are made. Parliament must be the last to decide on such deals.&#8221;&#8220;Government wants to spend R1-trillion of taxpayers money without consulting the people of this country. Once again, this ruling is a lesson to Mr Jacob Zuma and his cronies that time for backdoor deals is over,&#8221; said Cope spokesperson Dennis Bloem.United Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Holomisa has also welcomed the ruling saying that government needed to ensure accountability and transparency in its deals.&#8220;Government must stop trying to sneak such deals without the knowledge of the people.&#8221;&#8221; The ruling is also in favour of the millions of citizens who would have had to service this long-term debt for a deal that could have bankrupted the national fiscus.&#8221; said Holomisa.The court on Wednesday cited Governments and former Minister of Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson&#8217;s failure to gazette the nuclear determinations as unlawful.The court also ruled that international agreements must be tabled before Parliament.-TNA Reporter
