The advent of democracy and freedom in 1994 ushered in a new era of governance, where citizens in general and the previously oppressed in particular took back their country through the barrel of the ballot.The 1994 transition in many material aspects is characterised by far reaching compromises in terms of the identity and character of South Africa and her people. Democracy along western dictates carried the day, with dire consequences for African and traditional institutions of governance and leadership.The narrative was and continues to be that tradition is old, outdated and irrelevant by desk top analysts and arm chair critics. In the South African context the critics, and I dare say haters of traditional governance, believe that traditional leaders and democracy are at odds, while in fact the opposite is true.The political liberation movement traces its steps back to 1912, but that is not the genesis of the struggle for freedom. Way before the political liberation movement found expression in the struggle discourse, traditional leaders and traditional communities were already resisting and fighting colonial oppression in pursuit of people s freedom and self determination.We cannot pretend as though from 1652 to 1912 there was no struggle; there has never been a vacuum of leadership. In that period traditional leadership lead the charge to secure the freedom of the oppressed. For our future to make sense we must put our history in context, which is that our struggle never began in 1912.Yes, 1912 is an important historical point of reference but it cannot in anyway be categorised as the alpha and omega of the struggle. In 1912 kings, queens and traditional leaders were approached to become patrons of the liberation movement and champion the ideals of freedom and democracy; and they agreed.A case in point in this regard is the incarceration of King Dinuzulu on the island of St Helena for his strong opposition to the oppression of the black majority. While he never joined any political formation he actively lead a fierce fight against the injustices of black marginalisation. St Helena can be equated to Robben Island.Throughout the epoch moments of our country s struggle to push back the frontiers of colonial oppression and apartheid, traditional leadership was and is always on the side of the people. The liberation movement is thus founded on and is the continuation of the efforts of traditional leadership. The other mistake is that critics of traditional leadership subscribe to a shallow and lazy approach of playing the man and not the ball.They choose to couch their criticism solely on the actions of a few incumbents and on that basis sweeping generalisations are made about all traditional leaders; and further then demonises the system of traditional governance as if abuse of office is a norm rather than being an exception.All systems of governance have their shortcomings and all systems are vulnerable to abuse. Democracy has on occasion delivered dictators to office, but that does not in any way suggest that democracy is bad; it simply points to the character of those in office. All systems of governance are a work in progress, and all systems evolve.Traditional leaders lead and participated in the struggle for freedom fully conscious that freedom would deliver democracy and human rights; and therefore to suggest that traditional leadership as an institution is antihuman rights is without merit. It is in the absence of defined powers and functions for traditional leadership that rogue criticism will prevail. Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi MP has consistently called for the role, powers and functions of traditional leadership to be defined in legislation.It is high time South Africa heeded this call. He has done so since the democratic negotiations and most significantly when wall-to-wall municipalities were about to be implemented 17 years ago. In December 2000 a delegation of the Coalition of Traditional Leaders met with a Cabinet committee comprising all the relevant line function ministers and led by then deputy president Jacob Zuma.A formal agreement was reached that chapters 7 and 12 of the Constitution would be amended to ensure that the powers and functions of traditional leaders would not be obliterated by the implementation of the Municipal Structures Act and other legislation.To suggest that traditional leadership oppresses women is also without merit wherein women, past and present, occupy positions in institutions of traditional governance and leadership throughout the country and in instances they are presiding over cases, pursuing justice and championing development and service delivery.It is worth noting that the fact that as soon as it received powers to legislate the erstwhile KwaZulu government, which was predominantly lead by traditional leaders, repealed the Code of Zulu Law imposed on the oppressed by the colonial government, which relegated women to the status of minors.Upon repeal women were given rights of land ownership and inheritance, long before advocacy for gender equality gained momentum. The notion which suggests that traditional leadership grinds against the grain of democracy is also without merit when traditional leadership itself is founded on the fundamental principle of consensus, giving space to every voice and arriving at decisions through negotiation.Consensus is a form of democracy just like elections are a form of democracy which while it gives everyone a voice but ultimately the will of the majority prevails and the minority plays second fiddle. Consensus is inclusive and does not leave anyone behind. The idea that traditional leaders operate without any obligations to account for is yet again unfounded.Traditional councils as representative of the Community Act as a healthy system of checks and balances to ensure and uphold accountability. Furthermore these traditional councils are now elected by communities through secret ballot with strict quotas for women representation.The institution of traditional leadership and governance is undergoing serious, albeit piecemeal changes that are tailored to ensure that it is compatible with the democratic dispensation.The process of this transformation would move faster if the recommendations of the Cabinet committee made in December 2000 wherein it among other considerations, but not limited to, acknowledged that traditional leadership is a necessary component of our democratic governance construct and as such chapters 7 and 12 of the Constitution would have to be amended to prevent the obliteration of the institution of traditional leadership and create a synergy between the local government and traditional authorities and councils.As a matter of fact models of cooperation between traditional leadership governance and electoral democracy exist throughout the world, specifically the Queen of England is a traditional leader presiding over a democratic state. Our democratic order is solid and our Constitution is alive.Everybody is equal before the law and traditional leadership governance is not immune to scrutiny and like all institutions must be subjected to being weighed on the scales of the Constitution when its decisions and actions are suspect, as equally so should public representatives.It is disingenuous of critics to characterise traditional leadership as an enemy of democracy when on its shoulders it carried the very struggle of freedom and electoral democracy which delivered the rights we enjoy today. One of the sad successes of colonial oppression and apartheid has been the inculcation of the mentality to second guess all that which is African and embrace all that which is western and foreign.Our African arts, culture, traditions, religions and belief systems, literature and identity are being sacrificed at the altar of globalisation, which is in essence a sophisticated extension of colonialism. Often it is Africa that is expected to conform to and accommodate global trends, and rarely is that which is African conformed to or accommodated on the global stage.Traditional leadership exists, not to impose on us but to remind us of what and who we are as a people. In this regard with the world rapidly changing and demanding of South Africa and Africa to keep up it will become easy for us to lose a sense of ourselves, if we are not vigilant, to the extent that we may begin fixing what is not broken or breaking what is working.Traditional leadership governance bears the brutal brunt of the lingering threats of colonial-globalisation. It is therefore important to keep in mind that being African refers to more than mere geography. It exists as an embodiment of the character of Africa as well, to something in our make-up that distinguishes us from the rest of the globe.Part of that is to be found in the institution of traditional leadership, an institution quintessentially African, linking the distant past, the present and the future, and in doing so, it must be stressed, in an eminently practical and pragmatic manner.Thus the late Prof Herbert Vilakazi is correct when he points out that the wholesale dismissal of and desire to destroy all tradition and cultures is worse than barbarism itself .Mkhuleko HlengwaMkhuleko Hlengwa is an MP and IFP Youth Brigade national chairperson
