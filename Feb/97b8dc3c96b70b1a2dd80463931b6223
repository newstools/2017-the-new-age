Nigeria has recovered some $151 million and eight billion naira ($26.32 million) in stolen state funds in less than two months as part of an anti-graft drive, the government said on Sunday.The West African nation launched late in December a whistleblower scheme entitling those who help find stolen assets to up to five percent of the recovered sums, part of a drive by President Muhammadu Buhari to root out endemic corruption.Sunday&#8217;s announcement was the first since the middle of last year to give an official figure for recovered assets.&#8220;The looted funds &#8230; were recovered from just three sources through whistleblowers who gave actionable information to the office of the Minister of Justice and Attorney-General of the Federation,&#8221; the Information Ministry said in a statement.&#8220;The biggest amount of $136,676,600.51 was recovered from an account in a commercial bank, where the money was kept under an apparently fake account name,&#8221; it added. The other recovered funds were in dollars or naira.On Friday, Nigeria&#8217;s anti-corruption watchdog said it had seized $9.8 million in cash from the former head of the state oil company NNPC, a recovery also made possible under the whistleblower programme.Graft, particularly in the oil sector on which Nigeria relies, has taken large sums from the country&#8217;s coffers.Buhari rode to victory in 2015 on an anti-corruption platform after widespread anger at the plundering of the state under his predecessor Goodluck Jonathan.But some have criticized the current administration&#8217;s efforts as ineffective and called it a witch hunt against Jonathan&#8217;s supporters.-Reuters
