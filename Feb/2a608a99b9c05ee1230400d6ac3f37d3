The UN Security Council will hold an urgent meeting on Monday on North Korea&#8217;s missile launch, the first test since US President Donald Trump took office.The United States, Japan and South Korea requested the consultations after North Korea confirmed it had &#8220;successfully&#8221; tested a ballistic missile on Sunday.The council meeting is expected to begin around 5 pm (2200 GMT), said the Ukrainian mission, which holds the council presidency.North Korea&#8217;s state-run KCNA news agency said a &#8220;surface-to-surface medium long-range ballistic missile&#8221; was &#8220;successfully test-fired&#8221; on Sunday, describing it as a &#8220;Korean-style new type strategic weapon system.&#8221;The missile flew about 500 kilometers (310 miles) before falling into the sea, South Korea&#8217;s defense ministry said.The launch was seen as a test of the response from Trump, who pledged &#8220;100 percent&#8221; support to Washington&#8217;s regional ally Japan.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose country would be in range of a hostile North Korean missile launch, called the test &#8220;absolutely intolerable&#8221; during an impromptu press conference with Trump in Florida.The reclusive regime carried out more than 20 missile tests last year, one of which reached Japanese-controlled waters after a launch in August.North Korea is barred under UN resolutions from any use of ballistic missile and nuclear technology.The UN Security Council has imposed six sets of sanctions since Pyongyang&#8217;s first nuclear test in 2006.The latest round of sanctions imposed in November includes a cap on Pyongyang&#8217;s coal exports to China, aimed at depriving the communist state of hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.-AFP
