PRESIDENT Jacob Zuma will have to tell Parliament at the end of the month if he has instructed or influenced any state department or entity to award contracts to his immediate family.He will also have to say if he has used his position as head of state to order that any government entity or department give business contracts to businesses or companies with ties to his relatives.These two questions are part of a set of enquiries posed by the leader of the opposition, Mmusi Maimane, waiting to be answered in the National Assembly on August 31. The line of interrogation to Zuma covers his reign since 2009.Maimane not only wants answers, but he has also asked the President to state his position on the matter.The DA leader, who will open the question and answer session, has also put a question about the SABC to Zuma. He has asked him: What are the reasons for his delay to sign a proclamation to mandate the Special Investigating Unit to investigate the SABC), as requested by the SABC s interim board in May 2017? The last day of August will not be only filled with hostile questions to President Zuma. There will also be friendlier ones, albeit from the ANC, three of the six questions coming from the President s party. Two of these questions will be about the G20, with ANC MP E Kekana asking Zuma, the co-chair of the G20 development working group, whether there is any evidence that the G20 has embraced the concept of inclusivity.DENNIS CRUYWAGENnews@thenewage.co.za
