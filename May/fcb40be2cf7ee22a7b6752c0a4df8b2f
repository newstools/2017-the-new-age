Depending on which side of the political spectrum you choose, the split between the ANC and SACP will signal the end of political dominance by the ANC and herald the government of coalitions in our country.Without the working class largely constituted by the SACP and Cosatu, the ANC will struggle to identify with the poor and the working class. The alliance founded on a commitment to the National Democratic Revolution and the need to unite the South African society seems to have hit a snag.This leaves the SACP and Cosatu with a bitter pill to swallow when their members confront them about the failure of the government to implement workers demands. With the exception of building houses for the poor, providing water and infrastructure and social grants, the ANC has not adequately covered what workers consider to be their bread and butter issues.The question of labour brokers continues to be a thorn in the flesh of the leaders of the alliance, because instead of banning these, the ANC opted to regulate labour brokers instead. Gauteng s e-tolls continue to perpetuate poverty, while attacks by the ANC Youth League on the general secretary of the SACP, Dr Blade Nzimande and a campaign for him to be fired as Minister of Higher Education, open confrontation and assault of the SACP members in Mpumalanga, the assassination of the SACP members at Inchanga and other unresolved issues seem to force these longstanding comrades apart.These issues and public spats have remained unresolved to such an extent that most SACP members who felt marginalised by the ANC list process during last year s local government elections stood as independents.There is a difference of opinion about this looming split, others argue that this will expose the SACP for its parasitic tendency of hiding behind the ANC, but others think the ANC might come out as the biggest loser. Relations within the alliance were strained when former president Thabo Mbeki was still president of the ANC.Managing this relationship is proving difficult for President Jacob Zuma.It was former Cosatu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi and SACP Blade Nzimande who were at the forefront in defending then deputy president Zuma during his much publicised rape case and corruption case right up to the Polokwane elective conference where Zuma emerged as the president of the ANC.While Vavi has since been expelled by Cosatu, Nzimande no longer enjoys that relationship which was envisaged due to his close proximity to Zuma. There is no doubt that much has been achieved over the years but there seems to be more voices of discontent from both ANC and SACP.In some instances leaders of the alliance have been vilified on public platforms, booed and verbally attacked in the glare of the media. The latest Cabinet reshuffle seems to have made a serious dent and planted a seed of mistrust.There seems to be very serious contestation to the powers vested on the ANC president on matters of hiring and firing Cabinet ministers.Voices within the SACP are growing louder that the party must contest the state power alone because the party s views are ignored on major decisions.Gwede Mantashes s assessment of the divorce during the late Chris Hani Memorial lecture is that if the SACP serves divorce papers to the ANC, the next possibility is that it divides the electorate base and both will lose power.These warnings are not hollow.The SACP, known to be the vanguard, has turned out to be the fierce critic of the governing party. It is unimaginable that after 2019 the ANC can be out of power, but signs are beginning to show when you consider that it has already lost all big metros.As James Finn Garner, an American writer and satirist observes, The emperor is naked, the parade stopped, the emperor paused, a hush fell over the crowd, until one quick-thinking peasant shouted, no, he isn t.The emperor is merely endorsing a clothingoptional lifestyle .The governing party appear to be in denial that things are not alright, instead they embrace the narrative that all the problems the country is facing, including the double downgrades of the country to junk status are engineered by the white monopoly capital.It is in denial that it lost support right across the country, instead it says it supporters did not go to the voting stations.It is in denial that close to 70000 people who marched through the streets of our major cities calling for the president to resign are genuine, it sees this as racist.This is the year of OR Tambo, a man who united the liberation movement and delivered it intact after it s unbanning. Solly Mapaila of the SACP said critical factors with OR Tambo administration was that it had managed to accept and acknowledge the mistakes that it had made and he expected this to be the first port of call for the current administration, but he is not convinced that the governing party is prepared to do that.The jury is out as to whether the governing party of today and its current leadership will live up to the notion of self-correct, honesty and transparency.While this appears to be an unenviable task to the current crop of leaders of the movement, cracks seems to be running deep in such a way that even when the healing process begins, it will be too little too late.Speaking at the SACP s 91st celebratory gala dinner in Durban, then deputy president Kgalema Motlanthe said, because the relationship between the SACP and the ANC is and has always remained familial, it can best be described as that of siblings .He said such a relationship had equipped those in the ANC with the necessary tools of analysis and education needed to develop and successfully prosecute the struggle .He said this relationship has helped the ANC to understand the needs of the oppressed people better and to articulate the ANC s vision for a free and democratic South Africa that belongs to its entire people, black and white.If this is correct, how will each of these alliance partners survive without each other? The governing party will live to regret the divisive nature of public statements by some of its leadership and its unwillingness to heal the rift in the alliance that keeps increasing each day.But it is not yet too late for the alliance partners to reconsider the trajectory of the alliance that has resulted in this entrenched factionalism. It will be very sad to see the split of the alliance which was forged in the trenches some 50 years ago and Zuma will be accused for breaking it.Sibusiso Magwaza is former deputy director of communications in the office of the KZN Premier
