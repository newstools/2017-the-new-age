Millions of rand have been raised to refurbish the old sanlam building into a thriving social housing project in Port Elizabeth.The project, spearheaded by human settlements MEC Helen Sauls-August, is in an effort to fulfil the right to basic adequate housing.It speaks to the restoration of dignity to millions of South Africans who were marginalised for centuries and who still suffer from the legacy of apartheid.The project is committed to the National Development Plan s 2030 vision of transforming human settlements and the spatial economy to create more functionally integrated, balanced and vibrant urban settlements.Hence an amount of R68m was invested by both the provincial and national government in the Sanlam building project with R35m coming from the social housing regulatory authority and R27.6m from the department.The rest of the money was raised privately by the social housing institution.Sauls-August said the first part of the project would focus on the social housing element of the building and once that was complete, the other elements would follow. This marks a defining moment for the people of the Eastern Cape province as we are here to witness the fall of a painful past and the new beginning of a historic project. It is fitting that during the year of Oliver Tambo, the work to convert this building into a living memorial of the struggle for freedom commences now, Sauls-August said.She also said the social housing project would preserve the rich history and heritage of the building and create a living memorial of the struggle for liberation.The revamping of the building will begin this month and run for a period of 12 months. The project has been implemented by the Qhama Social Housing Institution and will have 220 units consisting of bachelor, one and two bedroom units.The project is for rental purposes and is open to people who earn between R1500 and R7500 a month.These projects have proven to be successful, especially when one looks at the Gauteng province.The R265m Thembelihle village provides a safe haven for more than 700 families and rents start as low as R700 a month.The housing project is aimed at providing affordable quality homes for low-income families.The second phase, comprising 492 units, will be ready for occupation in April.Meanwhile, low-income earners in Pretoria will be able to have homes closer to economic opportunities when they move into the new 900-unit social housing project in Marabastad towards the end of 2019.Construction of the R405m Marabastad Townlands Village will begin in October and is expected to be completed in September 2019.SISANDA MADWANTSIsisandam@thenewage.co.za
