The Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) K9 Unit recovered copper cables suspected to have been stolen from the City’s Power Station in Randburg earlier this week. After receiving information from the Crime Intelligence Unit, JMPD was able to trace and recover the stolen copper cables worth approximately R500 000 in value, hidden at a warehouse in Silverton, Pretoria. Public Safety MMC Michael Sun said two suspects were arrested in connection of this case and are detained at Silverton Police Station for further prosecution. The suspects will face charges of possession of stolen goods. Sun has commended the JMPD K9 and the Crime Intelligence Unit for their quick action. “The swift arrest of the suspects and recovery of the stolen copper cables is a clear message to the criminal syndicates that are sabotaging our City that their ill gains will come at a hefty price. Thousands of residents go without electricity for days because of cable theft, and the City has to spend millions of rands to reconnect the cables,” Sun said. JMPD is still on a search for the other suspects linked to this case. “We will ensure that these criminals are removed from our society and spend many years in prison where they belong,” Sun emphasised.
