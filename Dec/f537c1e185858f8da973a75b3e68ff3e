The Western Cape health department has announced a new safety plan for Emergency Services (EMS) personnel over the festive season. Previously, a number of organisations and committees, including Parliamentâ€™s Select Committee on Social Services, condemned attacks on EMS staff. The attacks were aimed at paramedics, firefighters and EMS personnel. Western Cape health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo said the festive season readiness programme is in anticipation of a surge in medical emergencies. The new safety plan is a technology platform that will guide EMS personnel when entering dangerous areas. EMS staff can also press a panic button in times of trouble. -TNA Reporter
