Mmabana Arts, Culture and Sports Foundation CEO, Dr Otsile Ntsoane, wants to restore North West as the home of artistic talent and investment in the country.For years, the once formidable entity has been taking a dive and at some point he felt it disappearing into oblivion.However, Ntsoane said the position of arts is getting redefined and that target is to grow the sector so that it becomes the biggest employed in the province.Subsequent to his appointment as the substantive CEO of Mmabana in March, Ntsoane started working in earnest to turnaround the entity by ensuring much needed stability.Ntsoane recently marked his first 100 days in office by sharing the day with staff of the foundation at the Mmabana head office in Mahikeng.The CEO used the occasion as a platform to share his desire to work towards seeing Mmabana Foundation emerge from its past history into a new path brought about by the new generation and the current staff.Among many initiatives Ntsoane has committed to the development of a film industry in the province. Bokone Bophirima has a beautiful landscape which offers nice settings for film production. Add to it the kind and welcoming nature of its people, then you have a complete environment in which film production could reside, he said.Ntsoane said the North West had a treasure trove of history that could be shared with the public through various media initiatives. This is the home of the Scout Movement, the three government administrations and many other stories which the world does not want to hear but if told through the art or film, they will listen. The growth of the music especially Motswako brand which is a music genre developed in the province is another untold story about the province, he said.Ntsoane made reference to the development of the music industry especially in KZN, particular the style called qhom .The development of the fashion design and craft industries were also high on the CEO s list. We pride ourselves as a province with creative persons in the design and visual arts. Through this industry Mmabana will produce school uniforms, protective clothing, sportswear and other forms of textile, Dr Ntsoane said.He said the foundation would focus, through the craft industry, on maximising the profit share in tourism product, industrial ornament, music instruments and household utilities.The provincial government has made arts and culture one of the three key pillars that will anchor the provincial economy.Culture, arts and traditional affairs MEC Ontlametse Mochware told those who attended the recent women economic summit to come up with ideas on how they could derive economic opportunities from cultural activities. We have institutions like circumcision schools and we all know that animals like chickens that are slaughtered for some of the rites are not any other that are mass produced, its chickens properly reared in the African way and it s an area we need to think about, she said.Mochware said the clothes put on by initiates were also specially made and those who were business savvy could easily create a market for themselves. We want to pride ourselves in our culture and we need people who can harness the current wave and run with it. There are traditional clothes, beads and many other artefacts that we can derive economic benefit from .&#8211;ELFAS TORERAI
