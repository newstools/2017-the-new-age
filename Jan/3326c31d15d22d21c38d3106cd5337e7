The widespread theft of copper cables causes havoc with the economy as it damages businesses due to lost revenues, deprive customers of a basic service and adversely affects their safety, Telkom spokesperson Gugulethu Maqetuka said.Telkom issued this statement following an increase in the number of cases of cable theft that have been seen and reported across the country. Furthermore, the utility said the grand scale theft of copper cable is also affecting its capacity to deliver services within acceptable time intervals. Business and residential customers are severely affected due to an alarming amount of copper cable theft that results in service interruptions. The severity of the impact is due to the fact that ICT services are a vital component to the running of businesses and an integral part of everyday living, Maqetuka said.Maqetuka said, the direct impact of cable theft included the disruption of essential services and costs of replacements or repairs of the affected infrastructure. The increase in copper cable theft is creating an environment of a rapidly deteriorating service quality and is severely affecting the delivery of sustainable ICT services to customers. In many high-theft areas, cable is repeatedly stolen, sometimes within days after replacements or repairs.In a bid, to counter the scourge of copper theft the company has adopted various interventions. Proactively alarming critical and sensitive cable routes and employing services of armed security firms, deploying wireless technologies that are alternatives to copper, assessing vulnerable aerial cable routes and, where feasible, these are buried underground. Working closely with the Non-Ferrous Theft Combating Committee under the auspices of Business Against Crime and the South African Police Services, to jointly find ways of protecting our cable network; implementing a national campaign to raise awareness of the company s toll-free crime-report line (0800124000) as the cooperation and support of all communities is vital in stamping out cable theft, Maqetuka said.Telkom has urged customers to handle each incident of cable theft uniquely as they always endeavour to restore interrupted services as expeditiously as possible. Telkom is not always automatically aware when fault conditions occur on individual lines and customers are, therefore, urged to use these numbers that are toll-free when dialed from a Telkom landline, Maqetuka said.Residential customers must dial 10212 and business customers 10217, to log line faults with the company.Keitumetsi Motlhaleprovinces@thenewage.co.za
