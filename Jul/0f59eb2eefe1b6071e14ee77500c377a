I believe Free State Premier Ace Magashule will make an excellent African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General says Minister of Mineral Resources Mosebenzi Zwane.Zwane said this on the side-lines of the ANC National Policy Conference held in Nasrec South of Johannesburg.Zwane is a former Member of the executive council who was responsible for Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in the Free State.The ANC youth league had previously said it preferred Free State Premier and Chairperson to take over from the current Secretary General Gwede Mantashe, who s term end in December 2017.In a twist of events Police minister Fikile Mbalula did not take lightly to the youth league s preferential candidate to take over from Mantashe. He instead urged the youth league to consider Gauteng Premier David Makhura as Mantashe s replacement.Mbalula went as far as saying Magashule will destroy what was left of the organisation. Ace Magashule is a definite no no the man will finish what is remaining of our movement. He will kill it in fact, he said.However, Zwane disagreed strongly with Mbalula saying that Magashule was a good leader, adding that he (Magashule) mentored many people in the Free State including himself.&#8220;Ace Magashule is a very good leader and many of us who come from the Free State were mentored &#8211; in one way or another &#8211; by him. I have a lot of respect for him and if the people of South Africa want him as Secretary General it would be a lovely moment in the ANC,&#8221; said Zwane.-Sipho Jack
