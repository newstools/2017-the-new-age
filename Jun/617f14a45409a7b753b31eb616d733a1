MEMBERS of Parliament were warned that if they did not vote for the financial sector regulation bill in the next few days, it was unlikely that the legislation would end up in the House of Assembly this term.The standing committee on finance yesterday discussed the FSR bill following a referral by the National Council of Provinces. As MPs were going through the bill, standing committee chair Yunus Carrim reminded them that time was important. The last sitting is on June 15. If we don t vote on this bill by tomorrow or Friday morning, it will be deferred to August. When members are engaging and raising fundamental issues, which we have addressed, the consequences are what they are, Carrim said.Also referred to as the Twin Peaks bill, the proposed legislation wants to launch a system of financial regulation by establishing the Prudential Authority and the Financial Sector Conduct Authority.It also wants to confer powers on these entities, preserve and enhance financial stability in South Africa, establish a financial stability oversight committee, regulate and supervise financial product providers and financial services providers and improve market conduct in order to protect financial customers.In addition, the bill wants to provide coordination, cooperation, collaboration and consultation between the Reserve Bank, Prudential Authority, Financial Sector Conduct Authority, National Credit Regulator, Financial Intelligence Centre and other organs of state in relation to financial stability and the functions of these entities.The bill also envisages the establishment of a financial council of regulators that will be headed by a director-general who will be charged with facilitating cooperation and collaboration between institutions.In terms of the bill, the Financial Control Sector Authority may make conduct standards for financial institutions, representatives of financial institutions, key persons of financial institutions and contractors. The bill states that a conduct standard may be made on requirements for the fair treatment of customers and to combat abusive practices.This standard could also include disclosing to customers financial principles and guidance for refusal, withdrawal or closure of a financial product or financial services.Yesterday, MPs agreed that investigators may enter and search premises in the case of a private residence with the prior consent of the person who is apparently in control of a business reasonably believed to be conducted there.In this regard, an investigator may also approach a judge or magistrate for a warrant where there were reasonable grounds that a financial sector law had been contravened or was about to be committed.TNA REPORTER
