A top Taiwan court ruled in favour of gay marriage Wednesday, a landmark ruling that paves the way for the island to become the first place in Asia to legalise same sex unions.The court said Taiwan&#8217;s current Civil Code, which says an agreement to marry could only be made between a man and a woman, &#8220;violated&#8221; the constitution&#8217;s guarantees of freedom of marriage and people&#8217;s equality.It gave Taiwan&#8217;s government two years to implement the ruling.-AFP
