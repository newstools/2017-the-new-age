Central Energy Fund group chairperson Luvo Makasi yesterday rubbished allegations of a love affair with Water Affairs Minister Nomvula Mokonyane.Addressing journalists in Sandton, Makasi denied he had a romantic relationship with Mokonyane and that he used his proximity to her to pull the strings in her department. This allegation of a romantic relationship, which has seen the minister relinquishing her executive authority to myself, is a blatant lie intended to defame, malign and discredit both myself and the honourable minister, Mkasi saisd. I have a professional relationship with the department and the minister by virtue of my position as an attorney and legal advisor. Makasi s comments were a response to media reports the Department of Water and Sanitation had been brought to heel by him due to his relationship.Makasi said he would be obtaining legal advice to have his name cleared. Being called a Ben something is defamatory and degrading. I won t respond to that any more. Depending on the legal advice, we may have to consider action, he said.Makasi believed he was a victim of a smear campaign against him for work done in the R5bn Giyani emergency water project. The sudden excitement came in because we ve been advising on a number of other things. The problem started when we started touching the Giyani project. For a whole year since August, nobody was even bothered about the advice we had given. When Mr Malema (Julius Malema) as well came in is when everybody caught wind about our legal opinion where we said that the contract is irregular. That is when the interest came in. I am a qualified attorney, and a director of Boqwana Burns Inc, a law firm which provides professional legal services. Bonolo Selebanobonolos@thenewage.co.za
