President Robert Mugabe has fired Zimbabwe&#8217;s top prosecutor, who now faces a misconduct trial, state media reported Saturday, the latest twist in a dispute dating back more than a year.&#8220;Suspended prosecutor general Mr Johannes Tomana was yesterday (Friday) fired for misconduct and incompetence after a tribunal set by President Mugabe to probe him recommended dismissal,&#8221; The Herald newspaper reported.Tomana faced charges of &#8220;criminal abuse of office&#8221; and was awaiting trial, the paper added, without giving further details.He was suspended in February 2016 after dropping charges against two men accused of plotting to bomb a dairy plant that belonged to the president&#8217;s wife, Grace Mugabe.A year earlier he was convicted of abuse of power after initially refusing to prosecute a legislator with Mugabe&#8217;s ZANU PF Party accused of raping a minor.Tomana, once seen as a Mugabe loyalist, was threatened with 30 days in jail for his conduct in the affair, but eventually reversed his decision.The legislator in question was eventually privately prosecuted, convicted and jailed.AFP
