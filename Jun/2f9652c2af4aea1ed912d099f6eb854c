US RADIO star Sway Calloway gave South African rapper Nasty C a standing ovation when the young rapper made an appearance on Sway in the Morning last week. Nasty C, who jetted off to the US for the BET Awards, may have lost out on the award but the appreciation he received from the radio mogul made up for it.The Durban-born rapper follows a string of other South African rappers such as AKA, Cassper Nyovest and Kwesta who dropped freestyles on the show but it is safe to say that none of them triggered the same reaction in the studio. Sway s trademark freestyle sessions have featured the likes of Kanye West, Snoop Dogg, Lupe Fiasco and Common in the past. The 20 year old was on a mission to impress and did not fail. He went in hard from the start and left Sway shaking his head in disbelief and wanting more.When the Mabala Noise valued artist finished, Calloway was on his feet screaming some of his favourite lines from the freestyle. My girl s body is like a DJ Khaled album, nice features! Who does that? I should be giving all these dues, Calloway screamed into the mic.The Hell Naw hit maker made it to the top trending spot on Twitter with social media users congratulating him for representing South Africa so well. Meanwhile, Cassper Nyovest also expressed his pride in the young rapperAfrica s new top artist, @Nasty_CSA explains how he has never experienced racism + he kills that freestyles live https://t.co/9N3O34Z9QY pic.twitter.com/9KlM6QYPtW&mdash; Sway Calloway (@RealSway) June 23, 2017 YOUNG HYENA: Africa s New Top Artist Nasty C Has Never Experienced Racism + Freestyle&#8230; https://t.co/DSxIOW0WcY&mdash; K1 GOAT (@KwestaDaKAR) June 23, 2017When Nasty C dropped a freestyle on Sway&#39;s show&#8230; pic.twitter.com/SkeawgRMxE&mdash; Dr. Rocky Sididzha (@rocsid808) June 23, 2017Nasty C just killed sway in morning, stupid bars &mdash; Eddie Robinson (@erob3232) June 22, 2017Watch freestyle and interview:&nbsp;NONTOKOZO GXUMISA
