South Africa s two busiest airports, Cape Town International Airport and Oliver Tambo International, are headed for major upgrades and facelifts that will cost billions of rands, according to Transport Minister Dipuo Peters.Capital investment programmes across the Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) were defined primarily to address refurbishment and replacement requirements of existing infrastructure and also to provide new or additional capacity, she said. The first intervention is to ensure the realisation of the full benefit of the existing infrastructure/assets over their entire useful lives as well as ensuring compliance to applicable legislation, standards and/or best practices.The second intervention is to introduce new or additional capacity to ensure that the Acsa network of airports can support the growth in air transport demand in a sustainable manner. Included among the upgrades for Cape Town are a new realigned runway and associated taxiways to cost R3.18bn.Preliminary work on the project started seven years ago in 2008, Peters said in reply to a written Parliamentary question from the DA s Pieter van Dalen.A preliminary design has been accepted and an environmental impact assessment approval is being awaited.Work is scheduled to start this July.
