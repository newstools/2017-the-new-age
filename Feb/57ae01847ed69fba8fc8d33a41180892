North West farmers have to step up to the plate and start the production of donkeys to supply hides to the Chinese market.The provincial government has given the green light to the commercial breeding of donkeys after feasibility studies cleared the way for the province to supply donkey skins and, to a lesser extent, meat to China s Henan province.The donkey production project is part of the quest to boost the local economy and will run under the village, townships and small dorpies (VTSD) development strategy.Rural, environment and agricultural development (Read) MEC Manketsi Tlhape said the donkey production programme entails animal cultivation which includes establishing donkey abattoirs and commercial trading of donkey meat and hides.She said the key ingredient in donkey hide, gelatine, is what the Chinese market looks for in donkeys and is used in the production of a Chinese medicine called ejiao. This is an ingredient used for various medical treatments such as delaying menopause in women, weight loss, flu and several others conditions, Tlhape said.The MEC said the spike in donkey hide demand around the world means that the donkeys and donkey products are now agricultural commodities that will contribute to the province sagricultural growth and development plan.It is estimated that 1.8 million donkey hides are traded annually while the global demand is about four to 10 million skins.Tlhape said her department will implement the donkey skin trade project in line with the fifth administration s vision to rebrand, reposition and renew the province while allowing the economy to grow. We are proud to be part of the provincial concretes and we note with gratitude that agriculture has been prioritised as part of the arts, culture and tourism strategy and will be at the apex of our provincial economy. We have therefore engaged and informed our local communities on the proposal to be undertaken by our department jointly with the provincial government to exploit the donkey trade market, she said.Tlhape was part of Premier Supra Mahumapelo s delegation in a visit to China last year.Finance, enterprise and economic development MEC Wendy Nelson was also part of the visit that meant to understand in fine detail what the Chinese really look for in the donkeysand how best the province can achieve this.Tlhape said her department will soon embark on capacity building and educational information sessions to educate communities on how the donkey production project will unfold. The target is that North West will start the supply of donkey hides by end of this year and Chinese experts will be roped in to train the local breeders to ensure that farmers are capacitated in this regard, she said.A memorandum of understanding with China has already been signed with the government, opening a way for the province in various areas of donkey production and trade.The programme in its entirety has key areas which include capacity building programmes for farmers and potential producers, mobilising donkey producers, establishing of a donkey feedlot and establishing an abattoir.There have been a number of incidents recently when local farmers reported their donkeys stolen.Some donkeys were found dead with their skins removed in villages near Mahikeng.Tlhape said such incidents should be strongly condemned. We strongly condemn the theft of donkeys and the illegal trade of hides and meat. In this new project, we will work together with all relevant stakeholders like the police, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) to curb the inhumane handling of the animals and donkey theft in the province. There is an increased emphasis on dispersing information about humane handling of animals. Communities are also being informed of the legalities on what constitutes cruelty or inhumane handling of animals in compliance to the Meat Safety Act No 40 of 2000, she said.When fully implemented, Tlhape said the donkey production programme will go a long way to alleviate poverty, address inequality, create decent jobs and contribute to the aspirations of the National Development Plan (NDP) and other national policy instruments such as Agricultural Policy Action Plan.She said it will also revitalise the agricultural value chain and stimulate the local economic development for the good of the province.ELFAS TORERAIelfast@thenewage.co.za
