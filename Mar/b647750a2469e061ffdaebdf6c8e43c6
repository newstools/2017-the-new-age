He has already entered into track and field folklore for his Olympics exploits, but it is always a humbling experience for Wayde van Niekerk to compete in front of his home crowd.The world 400m record holder is set to wow his legion of fans when he turns out at the second leg of the Athletics South Africa (ASA) Speed Series in Bloemfontein tonight. The 24 year old has been confirmed in the line-up for the men s 100m sprint at Free State Athletics stadium.Van Niekerk returns to the same track where he set a 100m personal best of 9.98 sec as he achieved the unique career milestone of breaking the sub-10 (100m), sub-20 (200m) and sub-44 (400m) barriers across all three official sprint distances a year ago. But his night will begin in style when he is honoured with an official plaque from the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), recognising his global one-lap phenomenal mark of 43.03 sec set at the 2016 Rio Olympics.Following his Olympics success, Van Niekerk has been raking in major awards, including the SA sports star of the year, Association of National Olympic Committees male athlete of the Rio Games and also being an IAAF male athlete of the year finalist last year. In the other events of the domestic track and field meeting, male athletes will compete in the 100m hurdles and mile event, as well as long jump.In women s events, 100m sprint and 100m hurdles contests will be held, while the javelin event is contested. As part of the country s preparations for the World Relays in Bahamas next month, there will also be 4x100m and 4x400m relay races for both sexes. We are looking forward to what is expected to be a wonderful atmosphere where the crowds are impatiently awaiting to see whether Wayde will spring another surprise and show his fitness status for the new season, ASA president Aleck Skhosana said. As we await the final entries, the Bloemfontein leg of the series is already looking tantalising indeed. The meeting will be held in the same 90-minute short format used at the Speed Series opener in Durban last week.Entry fees are R20 for adults and R10 for schoolchildren in uniform and students with their tertiary registration card. Training is always tough, whether you have won a medal or not, but I m putting in hard work to achieve as much as I can. I m building up towards the World Champs, Van Niekerk said.-Kgomotso Sethusha|kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
