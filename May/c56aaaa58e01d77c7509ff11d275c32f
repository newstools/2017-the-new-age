Rivaldo Coetzee s future at Ajax Cape Town remains up in the air and he may leave his childhood club next season. Coetzee was named the players player of the season and the player of the season at the club s awards ceremony on Saturday, a week before the PSL season ends and the Urban Warriors play their last match against Baroka on Saturday.The young defender is in the last month of his contract with the club but has an added twoyear option in the deal, which the club could exercise. However, this does not appear to be the intention as the club are yet to pronounce on Coetzee s future, even though they would not want him to go for free. The 20-year-old Bafana Bafana international has previously been linked with a big-money move to Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates and there were also reports of interest from French side Montpellier.Coetzee has started 24 league matches for Ajax this season and was rewarded for his outstanding contribution to the team which have had a torrid time in the Absa Premiership. With four PSL seasons under his belt, the young defender has come of age at Ajax and it may bot be long before PSL vultures start circling at Ikamva looking to pounce on him in the coming transfer window period. Coetzee made his debut in 2013 and quickly rose to prominence when he made his international debut in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Congo in hostile Point Noire, becoming the youngest player to represent South Africa, aged 17.His timing in the tackle, his ability in the air and his distribution makes him one of the most reliable defenders in the PSL. Meanwhile, the rookie of the season award went to Grant Margeman for his breakthrough season. The young midfielder scored as South Africa lost 2-1 to Japan in their opening U-20 Fifa World Cup in Korea yesterday. Erick Chipeta s goal against PSL champions Bidvest Wits was nominated as the goal of the season.It hasn t been the best of seasons for Ajax, who are not yet guaranteed a place in the top eight, with a game remaining. They sit on the edge with 36 points and will have to beat Baroka at home to secure a place in the MTN 8 Cup.-KGOMOTSO SETHUSHA|kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
