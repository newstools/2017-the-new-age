MTN has put off plans to list its Nigerian operation until next year, citing weak economic condition and its current dispute over regulatory issues in Nigeria.Towards the end of last year, Africa s giant telecoms business model future and level of investment going forward appeared to have changed completely, with more focus in Africa and Middle East than locally aiming for better returns.MTN also announced plans to stretch further into Iran s market where lately it has begin to claw some profits.The group s subscribers decreased significantly leading to a knock in average revenue both in South Africa and other parts of the continent where they are operating, according to MTN s March quarterly update.The biggest knock was a loss of 4.5 million subscribers in Nigeria as the cellular giant was forced to comply with the governments demand that it properly registers its customers.Africa s biggest mobile network operator in almost 22 countries was slapped with a staggering R76bn fine by the Nigerian Communications Commission last year for failing to disconnect around about 5 million unregistered SIM cards.However, the fine has since been reduced to R55.4bn. Since the MTN debacle with Nigeria, rival Vodacom has been capitalising on MTN s upside-downs.TNA Reporterbusiness@thenewage.co.za
