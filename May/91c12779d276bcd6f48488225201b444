Public Enterprise Minister Lynne Brown told members of the portfolio committee on Tuesday that she instructed her legal team to withdraw her affidavit to court in the matter of the reappoint ment of Brian Molefe as CEO. The DA has approached the High Court asking the court to set aside the appointment. Brown was answering to questions from P ublic E nterprise s portfolio committee members, on the reinstatement of Molefe as the utility s boss. Parliamentarians were furious about it saying that the matter made South Africa a laughing stock.However, the minister defended herself, saying that the governance regulations didn t allow her to be part of the appointment of the Chief Executive officers at the utility.Brown also made a startling announcement that she first learnt of the early retirement through the media.&#8220;So I didn&#8217;t expect that society would universally welcome news of Mr Molefe&#8217;s return to Eskom following the allegations levelled against him in the Public Protector&#8217;s State of Capture report,&#8221; she told the committee.Brown also said she supported Molefe s reinstatement, but as long as it was legal.Meanwhile, Eskom s chairperson Ben Ngubani refused to answer questions posed to him by committee members, citing his reason as an instruction rather advice from his lawyer.-Sipho Jack
