GIVEN their dreadful run of form, if there is one team that Mamelodi Sundowns will dread meeting at home it is Bloemfontein Celtic. Sundowns have not managed to win any of their last three home matches against Celtic, settling for a draw and two humiliating defeats.The most popular came two seasons ago when Celtic went to Lucas Moripe Stadium where the two teams will meet tomorrow night and beat Downs 5-0. It was an evening that Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane would get to know Thapelo Morena better, as the player terrorised the Sundowns defence out wide.The defending PSL champions head into tomorrow s match off the back of a 2-1 defeat to Kaizer Chiefs, while they also recorded a loss to Cape Town City and two draws to Polokwane City and Chippa United. Sundowns captain Hlompho Kekana, a former Celtic player, said his team will need to forget about history and produce a brutal performance. The only thing we are thinking about is points.We have to do whatever we can to win. Everyone is reminding us that Celtic always give us a tough time and we know that, but we are not going to think too much about it. We used to give Chiefs a tough time, where they have not beaten us for years but look at what happened on Saturday, Kekana said. 7 Our mind-set is one that says nothing is impossible. The focus is on regaining lost ground with the guys at the top of the log and we need to be ruthless. We create so many chances but do not take them. In the end, you start seeing a desperate Sundowns that misses a lot. The Celtic game is a chance for a fresh start and we are willing to take it. Unlike Sundowns, Celtic head into the match high on confidence following their victory over Polokwane City on Sunday. The win took Siwelele to 12th on the log with 22 points from 21 games, while Sundowns are fifth, with 34 points from 18 matches.mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za-Mmasekep Matsebane
