The DA says it has not yet received a reply from Northern Cape Premier Sylvia Lucas’s office after it wrote to her to ask why interns had not been paid for three months. DA member of the provincial legislature (MPL) in the Northern Cape Dr Isak Fritz said the premier’s office promised that the interns’ stipends would be paid by last week. “Interns based in Calvinia, who are on a year-long programme offered by the premier’s office, have not received their stipends for the past three months,” Fritz said. Fritz said, even the service provider meant to facilitate the stipend payments had not been paid by the premier’s office. “At this stage, we don’t know what is going on because the premier is not responding to our questions.” Fritz said the internship contracts come to the end in March 2018. He said he is feeling sorry for the interns as the festive season is fast-approaching. “These young people have families who are counting on them. For the premier’s office to withhold payment to these poor interns is shameless.” Repeated calls to the executive manager of communications in the premier’s office Monwabisi Nkompela went unanswered while the premier’s spokesperson Bronwyn Thomas-Abrahams asked that questions be emailed to her and Nkombela. -TNA Reporter
