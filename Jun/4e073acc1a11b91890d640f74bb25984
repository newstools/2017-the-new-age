The twinning of poorer schools with former Model C schools has yielded positive results and contributed towards enhancing the quality of education in Gauteng.Despite this, education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said more work needs to be done to overcome the legacy of apartheid. All schools that utilise a language to deny access to other learners must be persuaded and we will not stop persuading accordingly, we will never be free until we provide quality education to our people Lesufi said. There are still people who believe that naming a school Hendrik Verwoerd is relevant in this era. What is at the centre, which is non-negotiable with me, is that non-racialism is the future. You can t postpone it. The MEC was speaking at the opening of a three-day education lekgotla in Boksburg yesterday.lillians@thenewage.co.za
