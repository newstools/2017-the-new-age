The Gauteng Liquor Board buckled under pressure yesterday and made a U-turn on its announced weekend pass .On Tuesday, economic development MEC Lebogang Maile said that the GLB had announced a decision to extend trading times for licensed in-house liquor traders at the weekend.This meant that traders could do business from 10am to 5am instead of the 10am to 2am rule.The liquor authority said it was doing this to accommodate an influx of visitors expected in Gauteng for the ANC s 105th anniversary celebrations. Provincial traders had expressed excitement at the news but this was cut short yesterday.After pressure and complaints from different organisations including the ANCWL, yesterday the liquor authority announced that it had decided to no longer issue any special dispensation liquor licences. The primary aim of January 8 is for the ANC to reflect on successes and challenges of the previous year and outline the organisation s programme for the year ahead, ANC Women s League secretary-general Meokgo Matuba said. This tradition was started in 1972 and the ANCWL as an integral part of the ANC will not allow this historic events to be viewed as a drinking spree which requires liquor trading hours to be relaxed by liquor boards. Gauteng Premier David Makhura welcomed the move by the board to withdraw its decision.Upon becoming aware of the decision, Makhura engaged with Maile and MEC for community safety Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane requesting that the liquor authority withdraw its decision. We call upon law enforcement agencies to do their work and for communities to work with us in promoting responsible drinking, Makhura said.The Gauteng government said it would work with all township entrepreneurs, particularly liquor traders, to ensure they stick to liquor regulations and promote responsible drinking.Makhura added that law enforcement agencies will this weekend continue with their operations, which include high visibility of police, integrated roadblocks and enforcement of licensing conditions for liquor operators. The issue of alcohol abuse is a matter of great concern to us and we know that it contributes to social crimes, often overstretching our law enforcement officers, Makhura said.The board said following mixed public reactions on its decision, it then decided to no longer issue any special dispensation liquor licences. We have taken an approach to listen to the feedback of our key stakeholders and have decided that it is in the best interest of everyone that we revoke our decision, liquor board chairperson Fhedzisani Pandelani said.Maile also commended the board for its responsiveness to public reaction and stakeholder inputs. Even though the board was acting within the ambit of the law and the decision had the potential for economic spin offs, as a province we are fully behind the campaign against alcohol abuse hence we are implementing new stricter regulations to curb alcohol abuse, Maile said.All liquor traders in Gauteng will therefore be expected to operate according to their normal trading times.Pandelani added that although the board believed that sufficient and cogent reasons existed for the trading timelines to be granted to deserving traders during the designated days, the liquor authority was concerned about sending a wrong message that the board was encouraging alcohol abuse. As the liquor board we subscribe to responsible alcohol trading and we fully support initiatives aimed at curbing alcohol abuse. We have already implemented stricter regulations for those applying for liquor licences in Gauteng, Pandelani said.NTOMBI NKOSI|ntombin@thenewage.co.za
