The trial started last week Monday and will run for 29 days.It is alleged that suspects, Xaniseka Mkansi, 48, and Robin Mabitsela, 37, operated as serial rapists preying on women.Most of the attacks happened in cemeteries and a filling station in Tsutsumani, Alexandra.It is also alleged that Mabitsela, who is a local sangoma, operated alone from 2007 and was joined by Mkansi, who was a parolee at the time.The New Age has learnt that the accused have been linked to at least 25 cases through DNA tests.The suspects also operated around Juskei Park, East Bank cemetery, West Bank cemetery and Power Park.It is alleged that the men would pounce on unsuspecting women who would sometimes be in the company of their boyfriends and threatened them at gun point. According to the indictment, the boyfriends would be restricted at gunpoint while the suspects took turns raping the victims. In certain instances the accused would compel the boyfriends to have sex with their partners without consent while the two were watching. The victims and their boyfriends would then get robbed of their possessions such as cellphones, money and shoes at gunpoint. The accused would force his victims to massage his genitals, reads the indictment.In 2014 it is alleged that the accused received a ride from a couple in a Toyota Avanza.While in the car the suspects pulled out a firearm and forced the couple to a dilapidated house where they took turns raping the woman.Its alleged that one of the victims had been walking on 20th Avenue, near the Eastbank Cemetery at 8pm with a friend and the friend s brother when they came across the two men wearing balaclavas who held them at gunpoint and ordered them to walk with them to the cemetery.At the cemetery, they then ordered the brother of the friend to lie down and then ordered only the victim and not her female friend to undress and took turns to rape her.The state alleges that there was a criminal agreement at least shortly before and for the duration of the commission of each of the offences .Women and Men Against Child Abuse founder Miranda Friedman said they were closely following the case and called for hefty jail sentences.TNA REPORTERnews@thenewage.co.za
