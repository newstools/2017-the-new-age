Secretary General of the African National Congress (ANC) Gwede Mantashe on Friday said the Cabinet Ministers list was &#8220;developed somewhere else and was given to us to legitimise it&#8221;.&#8220;We were given a list that was complete, and in my own view as a secretary I felt like this list has been developed somewhere else and was given to us to legitimise it,&#8221; Mantashe said.He added that the whole process made him a little &#8216;jittery and uncomfortable.&#8217;The President held a meeting with the party s top 5 and its alliance partners on Monday to inform them about his decision to reshuffle cabinet.South African Communist Party (SACP) second General Secretary Solly Mapaila on Thursday said President Zuma used a shady intelligence report as his basis to fire both Pravin Gordhan and Mcebisi Jonas.He also added that the SACP rejected the report as baseless. We want to put it on record that we rejected the report. There s this notion that we are in agreement with the reshuffle and we are not, Mapaila said.Meanwhile, Mantashe also revealed that Monday s meeting was more on the area of the position of finance, and when they went there it was clear that Gordhan was going to be replaced.-Sipho Jack
