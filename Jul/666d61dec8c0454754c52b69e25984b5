African National Congress (ANC) Parliamentarian Makhosi Khoza said she is ready for any consequence for voicing out her concern in public. I am prepared to be punished for speaking out against wrong doings within the organisation. People of South Africa come first, and the ANC has a mandate to protect and uphold the constitution, Khoza said.She was responding to comments made by National Executive Committee (NEC) and party s head of organisational campaign Fikile Mbalula, when he told members of the media that those who will support vote of no confidence in the President will face disciplinary actions.Khoza urged National Assembly speaker, Baleka Mbete to exercise prudence when taking a decision on the motion of no confidence, which will be debated on the 8th of August 2017.Khoza further reminded the ANC of the Anti Zuma marches that took place in April asking the party to do right by those who voted it into power.At the same time she cautioned Mbalula about threatening ANC Mp s, adding that the minister s comments should be taken seriously as it sought to intimidate ANC Mp s. Mbalula is intimidating Mp&#8217;s by saying those who want to vote against President Zuma are suicide bombers, she reiterated.-Sipho Jack
