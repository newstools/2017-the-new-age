The Greater Giyani Municipality in Limpopo has settled to pay former municipal manager R1.6m after being taken to court for initially failing to reveal reasons why they could not appoint him after winning interviews twice for the municipal manager job.Municipalities head of communications Steven Mabunda said: &#8220;A special council of the greater Giyani municipality sat on 30 May 2017, where a resolution was taken to settle former municipal manager Mr GI Masingi and end a court battle that has been dragging on for more than two years.&#8220;We decided to settle him because the case has been dragging and the municipality could not advertise or make any appointment for the position. It was working against the municipality itself in as far as service delivery is concerned. Even if we continue to fight him we are already spending on legal expenses it&#8217;s not like we went to court and the court direct us,&#8221; Mubunda said.Masingi was the Municipal manager for the Greater Giyani municipality before his initial contract ended in 2014. The municipality put out an advertisement for a new manager in two occasions which Masingi participated in both the interviews and he was ranked in the first position.However the municipality did not appoint him for the position, it is after the second interview that he took the legal route.Mabunda added that initially when the former Municipal manager Masingi took the greater Giyani to court he wanted the council to reveal reasons why he was not offered the position despite him being rated number one in the outcome of all the interviews.&#8220;In the first place he wanted reasons as to why he was not appointed, that&#8217;s where it all started, it went on and on until now,&#8221; Mabunda said . However the council failed to give reasons of not appointing Masingi.&#8220;We decided to settle with Masingi in order to get underway with the process of appointing a new manager. However the municipality could not have gone into the process of making an appointment without dealing with the issues of the former municipal manager,&#8221; he said.-TNA Reporter
