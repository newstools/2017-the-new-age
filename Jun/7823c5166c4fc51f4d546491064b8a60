National junior 200m record holder Clarence Munyai is to lead a group of 18-year-old South African athletes to the African Junior Championships.The Olympic sprinter heads the 14-member national team that has been confirmed for the CAA African Junior Championships in Tlemcen, Algeria, next week. One of the brightest prospects in the country, Munyai smashed South Africa s 22 year old 200m junior record in March with an impressive time of 20.10 as he took a step further in establishing himself as the next big name in the sprint world.The 19 year old first set a personal best of 10.20 seconds in the 100m, so close to matching Akani Simbine s national junior record of 10.19 seconds. He was also included in the Rio Olympics team, one of three youngsters who travelled to Brazil last August to gain experience on the world s biggest stage. Also in the junior team is SA junior 100m hurdles record holder Taylon Bieldt, who clocked a national best of 13.35 to reach the final at the World U-20 Championships in Bydgoszcz last year.Meanwhile, Sokwakhana Zazini will spearhead a 12-member youth team, which includes nine boys and three girls at the IAAF World Youth Championships in Nairobi, Kenya early next month. Zazini set a world youth 400m hurdles best of 48.84 in March, while Tharina van der Walt, who launched a national youth best of 66.99m in the women s hammer throw, will be also among the medal hopefuls. Congratulations to all athletes for being selected to represent your country at the highest level, Athletics South Africa president Aleck Skhosana said. We wish both teams the best of luck. These may be small teams, but they are both strong and we believe these athletes will be able to carry the SA flag with pride. -KGOMOTSO SETHUSHA|kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
