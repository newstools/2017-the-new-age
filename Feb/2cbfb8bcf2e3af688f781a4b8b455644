The South African tourism industry is speedily becoming a pillar of the country s economy, as statistics showed that the sector, in the last three years, has experienced an increase in arrivals in a number of segments.A number of key sectors in the South Africa s economy have experienced relatively slow growth in recent years, especially sectors like agriculture, mining and manufacturing, which in the past had the potential of creating thousands of jobs.However, it is clear that the tourism sector has now risen to the task as a saviour of the country s weak economy.South Africa s economy has been growing below 1% lately, but is projected to grow at 1.3% this year. South Africa s tourism industry could be referred to as the country s proverbial pot of gold. Based on the most recent preliminary visitor figures released by top tourist destinations, as well as Cape Town International Airport, it is expected that this sector will, once again, provide an invaluable contribution to the country s national GDP this year, Josia Montsho, general manager of Pepperclub Hotel &amp; Spa, a five star hotel in Cape Town, said.Montsho said the country s tourism industry plays a major role in contributing towards economic growth and that witnessing the industry perform beyond expectations is an encouraging sign for the local economy. After experiencing the biggest decline in six years in 2015 due to changes to visa and immigration policies, the industry has made an exceptional recovery, he said. The milestone of 10 million passengers recorded by Cape Town International Airport in 2016, the highest number ever recorded is a testimony that this sector has the potential to uplift the SA economy. The sector also showed an 8% year-on-year increase in December 2016, recording over half a million arrivals during the month. He said the industry expects this trend to continue in 2017 with more developments planned to attract a range of travellers to our shores, for business and leisure. Overall, we can expect tourism to continue to meet annual targets and positively contribute to the much-needed growth of the South African economy, he said.On the other side, several segments such as medical and wedding tourism also appear to be on the rise.Last week, the Times of India reported that South Africa is witnessing a rise in wedding tourism involving overseas tourists, especially Indians families. It said that South Africa recorded a 27% increase in the number of Indian tourists last year, thanks to weddings.The national tourism sector strategy developed by the Department of Tourism makes it clear that South Africa must be in the top 20 of tourism destinations by the year 2020.Unathi Henama, a tourism expert and lecturer of tourism at the Tshwane University of Technology, said now that the US was regarded as a Muslim unfriendly tourism destination, this creates ample opportunities for South Africa to bend over backwards to attract Muslim tourists, a market that has high disposable income.In addition, recent statistics showed that growth in medical tourism has also contributed immensely to the country s GDP, registering 9% growth in 2013.Bernard Sathekgebernards@thenewage.co.za
