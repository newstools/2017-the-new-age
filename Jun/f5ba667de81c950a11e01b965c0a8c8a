The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) has on Monday strongly condemned the behaviour of two truck drivers who were driving recklessly on the N1 near Laingsburg.In a video captured by a fellow road user, it shows a truck overtaking another on a solid line while oncoming cars are forced onto the shoulder of the road.It is said that the incident occurred on June 18, about 50km outside of Laingsburg.RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane said &#8220;This kind of conduct places the lives of many innocent road users at risk and we call on the truck owners to take strong action to discourage this conduct&#8221;.He added &#8220;Truck owners are reminded that they have a responsibility to ensure that their vehicles are driven by fit and proper drivers who will not place the lives of other road users at risk&#8221;.Trucks are contributing significantly to road fatalities on South African roads.Last year the RTMC investigated 36 accidents involving trucks. A total of 143 people died in those accidents while 136 were injured.Head on collisions and multiple vehicle crashes were main factors in these accidents which points to negligent driving and disregard for road rules.The RTMC commends the motorists who recorded and reported the unwarranted conduct of these drivers.&#8220;We urge all motorists not to turn a blind eye to transgressions of road rules,&#8221; said Zwane.-TNA Reporter
