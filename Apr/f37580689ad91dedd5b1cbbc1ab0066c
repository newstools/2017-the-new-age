Samsung&#8217;s new Galaxy S8 went on sale over the counter in South Korea Friday as the world&#8217;s biggest smartphone maker seeks to move on from a disastrous handset recall and corruption scandal that has hammered its once-stellar reputation.The device, unveiled in New York last month and a challenge to Apple&#8217;s iPhone, is the firm&#8217;s first major launch since last year&#8217;s humiliating withdrawal of the Galaxy Note 7 over exploding batteries.It also comes with vice-chairman Lee Jae-Yong and other executives on trial for bribery over their alleged role in the graft scandal that brought down former president Park Geun-Hye.But the company&#8217;s profits are rising and the new phones have received good reviews, with more than one million pre-orders for the S8 and the larger S8+ in South Korea alone.Shares in Samsung Electronics jumped more than 2.5 percent Friday, adding around $7 billion to its market capitalisation.&#8220;Market reactions to the release of the S8 series are somewhat positive,&#8221; said Lee Seung-Woo of IBK Investment Securities.Samsung could break the record 48.5 million unit sales it achieved with its S7 series, he added.&#8220;Barring the weakening of the US dollar, Samsung&#8217;s second-quarter operating profit would reach 12 trillion won,&#8221; Lee said.Pre-order deliveries began earlier this week, and in-store sales begin in the US and Canada later Friday, with the device due to be rolled out to around 50 more countries next week.&#8211; &#8216;Highly competitive&#8217; &#8211;Samsung Electronics is the flagship subsidiary of the giant Samsung Group, whose revenues are equivalent to a fifth of South Korea&#8217;s gross domestic product, and the S8 series introduction comes at a delicate time for the embattled firm.The Note 7 recall debacle cost it billions of dollars in lost profit and hammered its global reputation and credibility, forcing it to apologise to customers and postpone the S8 launch.&#8220;The latest salvo from Samsung shows how it s keen to regain consumer confidence and attain leadership in the smartphone landscape, a nearly saturated but still highly competitive space that remains key to retaining subscriber loyalties and winning new converts,&#8221; IHS Markit said.When Samsung unveiled Galaxy S8 and S8+ in New York last month, it said the new handsets would mark a &#8220;new era of smartphone design&#8221;.Fitted with screens of 5.8 and 6.2 inches, the two handsets include Samsung&#8217;s upgraded digital assistant Bixby, competing in a crowded field that includes Apple&#8217;s Siri, Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa.The most striking feature of the new phones is what Samsung dubs an &#8220;infinity display&#8221; &#8212; an expanded glass screen that covers the entire front of the device and appears to curve seamlessly around its edges.But some consumers have complained that the screens on their devices have a reddish hue. Samsung said in a statement that users could manually adjust the colour range according to their preferences.The home button has been replaced with a pressure-sensitive section embedded under the screen, and the water-resistant phone allows for biometric authentication with fingerprint and iris scanners.The world&#8217;s largest memory chip and smartphone maker has said it expected its operating profit in the January-March period of 9.9 trillion won ($8.8 billion), up 48.2 percent from a year earlier, thanks to strong sales of memory chips and display panels.-AFP
