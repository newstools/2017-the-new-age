Veteran Filipino Manny Pacquiao said Monday he plans to show he is &#8220;not done yet&#8221; when he defends his world title against Australia&#8217;s Jeff Horn in Brisbane in July.The eight-weight world champion said the bout with the undefeated Horn was an opportunity to prove he could continue to be a global force at the age of 38 as he juggles boxing with a full-time job in politics.&#8220;(I want) to defend my crown and prove that I&#8217;m still there in boxing, despite of my ambitions in office as a senator,&#8221; he told reporters on an Australian visit to promote the July 2 bout.&#8220;I&#8217;m still handling my boxing career. I&#8217;m still there. I&#8217;m not done yet in boxing.&#8221;Pacquiao first won a world title at flyweight (112lb) two weeks before his 20th birthday in December 1998 to start a storied career that has seen him win global belts all the way up to super welterweight (154lb).&#8220;Boxing is my passion. I started when I was young &#8211; it&#8217;s part of my life,&#8221; said Pacquiao.&#8220;It depends on how you discipline yourself, how you train and prepare yourself. It&#8217;s a matter of discipline.&#8221;&#8220;Pac-Man&#8221;, who briefly retired early last year before making a successful comeback against Jessie Vargas in Las Vegas in November, added that he was excited to face Horn, 29, in the WBO welterweight title fight at the 55,000-capacity Suncorp Stadium.&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to predict the fight but I will do my best to entertain the fans,&#8221; he said.&#8220;I&#8217;m very excited to fight here, I&#8217;ve fought a lot of fighters in the (United) States. This is new, I&#8217;m excited. I can&#8217;t wait for the fight.&#8221;Pacquiao (59-6-2, 38 knockouts) is an overwhelming favourite against Horn (16-0-1, 11 knockouts), but the Filipino great has not stopped an opponent since his 12th round TKO of Miguel Cotto in 2009.&#8220;I don&#8217;t know much about him (Horn) but I know he&#8217;s a fighter. I haven&#8217;t watched his fights yet but I&#8217;m going to get his last three fights and watch them,&#8221; he said.-AFP
