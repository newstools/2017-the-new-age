Almost four years have passed since the Blyvooruitzicht Gold Mine near Carletonville entered into provisional liquidation in August 2013.On that day, as the operation was abruptly halted, thousands of employees and the surrounding community of more than 6000 people were plunged into an unmitigated crisis.Blyvoor, as it is known, was operated by publicly-listed companies and their subsidiaries for more than 70 years, during which time vast mineral wealth was extracted. But there is no evidence of that prosperity today.Instead, residents of the old mine village battle environmental and health concerns associated with living on the edge of an unrehabilitated mine site. They face crushing poverty and uncertainty about their ability to remain in their homes in some cases where their families have lived for generations.The basic services historically provided by the mine, including water, sanitation, and electricity, are now under constant threat of termination, as the local government purportedly struggles to absorb the residents into its realm of service provision. Information about these issues or indeed, about the future of the village has proved nearly impossible for the residents to obtain.Local resident Comfort Zwane recalled over the years trying to speak with the municipality, the liquidator, the Department of Human Settlements, whatever door was open. They all told us we must write down our problems and they will come back to us but they haven t. We are viewed as just tenants here, without rights. At the time, Blyvoor s owner/operators drove away from the mine s parking lot, never to return, the mine was in the process of being sold from one publicly-listed company (DRDGold Limited) to another (Village Main Reef). That deal was never formalised, but it seems that neither company acknowledges responsibility for the disaster left behind. The government has likewise struggled to alleviate the plight of the Blyvoor village residents.Despite the formation of a number of task teams and a stated awareness of the problem across multiple government departments, the circumstances of the village have only got worse in the years since provisional liquidation was initiated.Local government, in particular, reports being unprepared and under-resourced for the task of service delivery in the village, resisting taking on this role because it views the area as private property .In the meantime, sewage flows through the streets because the sanitation system is breaking down and rubbish has piled up around the village in the absence of municipal collection. A serious public health crisis is brewing.The lack of accountability on all fronts has left the former Blyvoor employees and their families to fend for themselves.Last Friday, Lawyers for Human Rights, together with the International Federation for Human Rights, published a report detailing the results of a community-based human rights assessment analysing the impacts of the sudden cessation of the mine s operations and the drawn-out process of provisional liquidation on the human rights of the surrounding village community.The report catalogues the failure of much-vaunted corporate responsibility, which was unsuccessful in cushioning the blow dealt to this now-indigent community and the contaminated environment in which residents now live.Despite corporate commitments that the host community would be equipped for the eventual closure of the operation, employees were ill-prepared for life after mining.Similarly, the complete lack of environmental mitigation or rehabilitation measures undertaken at the mine since August 2013 means that today great plumes of toxic dust from untended mine dumps regularly blanket the community.Pule Molefe, a member of the Blyvoor Residents Committee, says that during the windy season, drivers must use their headlights to navigate, even in the middle of the day.The fine white powdery waste even finds its way into bread baked in a local bakery. It is unclear who will resolve this problem or bear the associated costs. The study also looks at how existing legislation and government institutions have thus far failed to protect those most affected by this sudden mine closure.Residents repeated pleas for assistance have gone unheeded and confusion regarding the fulfilment of corporate environmental and socio-economic obligations in the context of insolvency proceedings, appears to reign.But there can be no question that the circumstances in which the Blyvoor Village community has been left represent a violation of a fundamental premise of South Africa s key mining and environmental laws, which mandate that development must be socially, environmentally and economically sustainable and that mining, in particular, must ensure the social upliftment of affected communities.Today, we call on corporate and state actors to intervene in the circumstances of the Blyvoor Mine Village and to craft a comprehensive plan to help alleviate this crisis.Such efforts must include immediately securing the community s access to basic services and housing, supporting local government to incorporate the village into the municipal fabric, ensuring the environmental rehabilitation of the area and providing residents with information and an opportunity to participate in determining their own futures.Far from being the beneficiaries of sustainable development, the abandoned Blyvoor residents today are significantly worse off for the mine having been there.More broadly, this unfolding disaster provides a stark warning of the potential fate for many of South Africa s mining communities, where dozens of mature mines are approaching the end of their lives.Beyond the example of Blyvoor, the practice of casting off under-performing assets by invoking insolvency proceedings might be an effective way to safeguard shareholder profits but the negative impact on South Africa s environment and communities cannot be overstated.The government must work to clarify the law and close loopholes that allow for such circumstances to arise. In addition, the state must also ensure that the legal obligations of corporations to rehabilitate the environments in which they operate are enforced, as are those that protect mining communities from collapse at the end of the mining cycle even where, as in Blyvoor, closure comes earlier than anticipated.Without acting on the lessons learned at Blyvoor, there is a danger that many thousands more will face the same bleak future.Michael ClementsMichael Clements of the Environmental Rights Programme, Lawyers for Human Rights
