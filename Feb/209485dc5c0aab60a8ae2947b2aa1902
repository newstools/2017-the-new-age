THE UWC Science Learning Centre for Africa (UWC-SLCA), in partnership with the Garden Cities Archway Foundation and the Western Cape education department, will open five new science learning centres (SLCs) to support hands-on science teaching and learning at five schools tomorrow.UWC rector and vice-chancellor Tyrone Pretorius, Garden Cities Archway Foundation chair Myrtle February and principals of the respective schools will open five new SLCs at schools in the greater Cape Town area.The schools have been identified as Ocean View High in Ocean View, York Road Primary in Lansdowne, Spes Bona High in Athlone, Phakama High in Phillipi and Manzomthombo High in Mfuleni.The five schools would bring to 45 the number of SLCs constructed, with a further three to be opened soon. The construction of the SLCs was an extension of curriculum support provided by UWC-SLCA and served as a reward for committed science teachers, school management and pupils.In 2011, UWC-SLCA in, partnership with Garden Cities Archway Foundation started the construction of science laboratories at Western Cape schools. The Western Cape education department joined the partnership in 2016, and contributed one-third of the costs.The achievement of pupils and teachers in national and international benchmark tests painted a very bleak picture, one that highlighted a national crisis. Director of UWC-SLCA Shaheed Hartley said: We have to start with the basics; supporting teachers to develop the confidence to teach science with an advanced level of understanding, knowledge and teaching skills.Organisations and funders who want to play a part in the initiative are encouraged to email Hartley Hartley at slca@uwc.ac.za or call 021 959 2680.TNA Reporter
