It s that time of the year when Parliament hosts the state of the nation address, politicians and their partners strut their stuff on the traditional red carpet and the political opponents try to sabotage President Jacob Zuma s big moment.It s also the week in which the ruling party will put its best foot forward in a deliberate charm offensive as it rubs shoulders with diplomats, trade unionists, business people and others who wield influence.On Tuesday it hosts a Pre-Sona Business Investor Luncheon in Cape Town. The presidency says the luncheon will be attended by business leaders and leaders from organised labour groups. The meeting will serve as a platform to further strengthen cooperation between government, organised labour and business to promote inclusive economic growth, radical socio-economic transformation and job creation in South Africa.At 7pm on Thursday, Zuma is scheduled to deliver his diagnoses of the health of the nation.His report will be covered live on radio and television. In a first since the advent of democracy, Zuma is also expected to address thousands of ANC supporters at a People s Assembly in Cape Town s Grand Parade immediately after he delivers the Sona.The ANC says it expects at least 10000 people to attend. On Friday, Zuma will be the main guest at a breakfast briefing hosted by The New Age and the SABC.Whatever happens in Parliament on Thursday evening, the following day President Zuma will tee-off in the Annual Presidential Golf Challenge and also be at a fund-raising dinner.On Monday afternoon, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will rub shoulders with professionals and members of the business community in Cape Town as part of the ANC s preparations to hold a people s assembly in the city.While Sona will dominate the activities at Parliament this week, the parliamentary committee programme will continue.On Tuesday, the Department of Health is due to brief the portfolio committee on health on the impact of its mom connect programme in improving the health of pregnant women and reducing maternal, neonatal and infant mortality.The portfolio committee will also be informed about progress being made in the placement of health professionals who have obtained their qualifications.On Wednesday, the National Council of Province s select committee on Trade and International Relations will receive a presentation on its 2015/16 annual report from South African Tourism.DENNIS CRUYWAGENdennisc@thenewage.co.za
