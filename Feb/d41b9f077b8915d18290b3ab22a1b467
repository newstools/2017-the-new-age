The Life Esidimeni family committee said it hopes the Parliament debate on the death of mentally ill patients of Life Esidimeni will not be used for political point-scoring.Parliament will on Thursday debate the death of over 100 patients that were transferred from Life Esidimeni to unlicensed NGOs.&#8220;It is appropriate for the nation to focus on the state of mental health care services and the loss and suffering of our loved ones. It is essential that there is a proper investigation into what happened, who was responsible, and who must be held accountable. Most of it all, it is crucial that there is restorative justice, and a sense of closure for us as families.But we wish to make it very clear that, in the process, the lives of our loved ones should not be used as a political football by any of the parties represented in Parliament,&#8221; the family committee said in statement on Thursday.Apart from the Parliamentary debate, the Life Esidimeni family committee said it calls for urgent attention to be paid to the recommendations made by the health Ombud. They cannot wait for the National Assembly to finish its work and Parliament must not in any way delay the implementation of the report, the committee said.Meanwhile Gauteng MEC of Health Dr Gwen Ramokgopa on Wednesday said that they are committed to restoring confidence in the public health system.Speaking at a media briefing on the tragedy, Dr Ramokgopa: &#8220;a dedicated team of managers and experts has been established in consultation with families.&#8221;The Gauteng health department last week Saturday held a healing session with families who were affected by the tragedy of life Esidimeni.Dr Ramokgopa also stated that they have also requested full records and lists of patients in all facilities.&#8220;We are compiling a list of unclaimed bodies and those that have been buried already. We are validating all records and we are requesting media to help us to popularise the direct line so all families can be reached,&#8221; said Ramokgopa.Ramokgopa also appealed to families that have family members that were at Life Esidimeni to update their contact details.-TNA Reporter
