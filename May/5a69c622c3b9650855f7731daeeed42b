Following The New Age s expos on an ID books racket, the Department of Home Affairs has revealed it has made 166 arrests for fraud and other crimes through its anti-corruption programme, Bvisa Masina.The figure includes 85 officials arrested and 81 members of the public either working alone or for syndicates. Home Affairs spokesperson David Hlabane said they were fast-tracking the fight against corruption to support the national anti-corruption strategy recently launched by Minister Jeff Radebe. He said they had noted the report on a green barcoded ID books syndicate in The New Age (Friday May 26). The department is doing all in its power to enhance security and it will spare no effort, working with the police, to step up investigations and bring all the culprits to book, Hlabane said.He said the department s offices were advised to send documents that had not been collected in six month time to a central place for destruction. The message from the department to citizens has always been to treasure your documents , he said.The department recently published a discussion document on the repositioning of Home Affairs for public comment. Its priorities include building a government department with professional staff who will responsibly manage identity securely, efficiently and humanely. Selection and training of such officials will assist in tightening security and combating activities such as those alleged in the report. Hlabane said completing the modernisation of the department and moving towards new digital systems and processes will assist in enhancing the security of identity documents as well as that of the nation s integrity and reputation.He urged citizens to apply for the new smart ID cards which are produced through automated processes for increased security.MTHOKOZISI DUBEmtokozisid@thenewage.co.za
