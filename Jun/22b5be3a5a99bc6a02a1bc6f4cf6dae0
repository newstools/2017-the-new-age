Parents should ensure that their children are immunised against measles, spokesperson for the Free State health department Mondli Mvambi said.The department has expressed a concern about the lack of interest by the parents to have their children immunised. We are concern about the lack of interest shown by parents in the immunisation of their children. Measles is a contagious disease, and so it is important that parents bring their children to clinics for immunisation,&#8221; Mvambi said.The department of health has conducted a nationwide measles campaign. The aim is to reach as many children as possible to increase immunity levels.Mvambi said nurses would be visiting schools and creches to provide free measles vaccine injection to children. The service is rendered on the same day for each child who qualifies regardless of whether they have received the services before. The measles vaccination service will be recorded in the Road-to-Health-Booklet, he added.The World Health Organization has warned that measles was spreading across Europe wherever the immunisation coverage dropped.-Sipho Jack
