Cape Town City will enter tonight s Absa Premiership top of the table clash with Kaizer Chiefs at Cape Town Stadium with nothing to lose , according to coach Eric Tinkler.Unlike Chiefs, City, the league leaders with 46 points, have over-achieved beyond their wildest dreams and will go into this match feeling less pressure, Tinkler claims. Although winning the league is still their dream, failure to do so will not be a disaster, compared to their more illustrious rivals, who are in danger of finishing a second successive season empty handed, following their exit from the Nedbank Cup at the weekend.Another defeat for Chiefs will all but be the death knell for their slim chance of winning the league. We ve reached a stage where we have got nothing to lose. But we still need to throw everything out there to try and win as many points as possible to go for the league title, Tinkler said. The first obstacle is Chiefs, so we have to be highly motivated. With Chiefs coming from a defeat against SuperSport United and having played 120 minutes, Tinkler said that could work to City s advantage as they did not play at the weekend. (Coach) Steve Komphela I think is going to worry about squad selection. That s something we don t need to worry about. We had enough rest to recover and we just need to focus. Tinkler and Komphela will be hoping that Lebohang Manyama and Gustavo Paez will score for them.-Neville Khoza|nevillek@thenewage.co.za
