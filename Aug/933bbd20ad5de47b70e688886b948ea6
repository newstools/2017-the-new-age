The authorities have urged anyone with information on the illegal sale of RDP houses and stands to come forward to help nab the culprits after a volunteer in Johannesburg’s Ivory Park housing department offices was arrested on Friday by the Hawks for illegally selling council stands and RDP houses. The arrest of the suspect follows an investigation by the city’s Group Forensic and Investigation Services and the Hawks after a complaint from a member of public who purchased two RDP houses at a cost of R150000 in Ivory Park. The complainant met the suspect in September 2014, who said she had two available RDP houses for sale but were occupied by illegal immigrants. Each RDP house was sold for R75000. In December 2014 an amount of R100000 was paid into the suspect’s bank account and another R50000 was paid into the account later. Despite making full payments, no keys to the RDP houses were handed to the complainant. In August last year the victim reported the matter to the suspect’s manager. The suspect then promised to pay back the money but never did. Group Forensic and Investigation Service Director Lucky Sindane said they discovered that the suspect had also scammed other people in the Ivory Park area. “In 2012 the suspect illegally sold a vacant stand to a member of the public for R65000. Only R55000 was paid into her account and the second complainant promised to pay the balance upon occupation. A lease agreement between the two was signed but the second complainant never occupied the stand,” he said. Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba said they would work with the Hawks, the police and other institutions within the criminal justice system to stop such corruption. “Anyone who might have information on the illegal sale of stands and RDP house should come forward. The information will assist the law enforcement agencies as they continue to investigate these cases,” he said. CALLYN MARKS news@thenewage.co.za
