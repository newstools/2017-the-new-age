Those looking for a smooth ride can look forward to performances from ladies of song, Wanda Baloyi; the sassy and elegant Brenda Mtambo. Fans of Afrobeat will be treated to Nigerian star Femi Koya’s repertoire of hits, and for a more youthful audience, Nombulelo Maqetuka, Tumi Tladi and Alpha K will tantalise their pallets with some youthful energy. The beautiful natural surrounds of the resort which include zebra and blesbuck roaming free and various bird species chirping in the air will be a stunning backdrop for a family-friendly gathering that is styled as a picnic. The show’s founder and CEO of T-Musicman, Peter Tladi promised musicians and visitors a great time. “We are pleased that Gauteng and neighbouring North West residents who might not be going away to the coast for the December holidays finally have a big concert to dazzle them”. “We also know that many more people travel from out of the province and the country to enjoy time with their relatives in Gauteng or just to enjoy the blissful Highveld summers,” he said. -TNA Reporter
