The South African Faith Communities Environment Institute (SAFCEI) says the setting aside of governments nuclear agreements is a blow for corruption and greed.On Wednesday the Western Cape High Court set aside the determination signed by former minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson in December last year which lays the basis for the nuclear procurement with Russia, South Korea and the United States declaring that they were unlawful and unconstitutional.SAFCEI alongside Earthlife Africa approached the court back in October 2015 to challenge government s intention to procure up to 9 600MW of nuclear energy.&#8220;This is a blow for corruption and greed and it is a fantastic win for democracy. This means the rule of law must be followed and that if South Africa wants to go with any future nuclear deal it f r ist follow due process and the people of South Africa must be consulted,&#8221; said SAFCEI&#8217;s Liziwe McDaid.The court on Wednesday citied Governments and former Minister of Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson&#8217;s failure to gazette the nuclear determinations as unlawful.The court also ruled that i nternational agreements must be tabled before Parliament - which was not observed in this matter.The Department of Energy has reacted to the judgment tweeting that it notes the ruling and is currently review ing the courts decision.&#8220;We believe it would be best for government to acknowledge that there has been wrondoing and actually fix it ,&#8221; said said McDaid. &#8220;Let&#8217;s not have those that don&#8217;t have the country&#8217;s best interest at heart, they should not be making decisions on our behalf .&#8221;Opposition party the Congress of the People (COPE) have also welcomed the court ruling saying that South Africans must be invloved in the nuclear decision making process.&#8221; COPE supports that people of this country must also be involved when these nuclear decisions are made. Parliament must be the last to decide on such deals.&#8221;&#8221; Government wants to spend R1 trillion of taxpayers money without consulting the people of this country. Once again, this ruling is a lesson to Mr Jacob Zuma and his cronies that time for backdoor deals is over.&#8221; said Cope spokesperson Dennis Bloem.SAFCEI has made it clear that they don&#8217;t believe that nuclear energy has any place in South Africa&#8217;s energy mix.&#8221; We don&#8217;t believe that there is any benefit to nuclear energy. If you look worldwide its on the wane and the risks that would accrue to South Africans far outweigh any list of benefits,&#8221; said McDaid.Eskom said it would read the judgment before responding.-TNA Reporter
