The Hawks in Mpumalanga have confirmed the arrest of four senior officials under Emalahleni Municipality.The four senior officials were arrested by the Hawks when they came unannounced at meeting held by the executive mayor Lindiwe Ntshalintshali on Wednesday.This comes after the Democratic Alliance (DA) lodged a complain about the senior officials who are alleged to have stole money in the Cooperative.The Member of Provincial Legislature of the DA Jane Sithole in Mpumalanga welcomes the arrest .&#8216; We are satisfied with the investigation so far and we will continue working with the HAWKS in order to end the cycle of corruption in eMalahleni said SitholeThe Municipality reported that it was aware of an investigation conducted by the Hawks when allegations of fraud related to the sale of farms started spreading about eight months ago.The municipal spokesperson Kingdom Mabuza said the arrested MMC is innocent until proven otherwise by a competent court . The opposition, particularly the DA, falsely accused the Municipal Manager Theo Van Vuuren of corruption related to the sale of farms said MabuzaHe added that The arrest, which is highly regrettable, will hopefully result into the DA to desist from further accusing Van Vuuren of imaginary corruption and allow him to execute his duties The municipality mentioned the accusations are unfortunate and baseless perception planted by the DA against Van Vuuren has resulted in, among other things, diminishing respect and trust within the communities and failure to focus on his duties, including reluctance by the community and business to cooperate on issues of payment for service. With this matter now in the hands of the Hawks and before the court we hope that Van Vuuren will be afforded an opportunity and support to continue dealing with real issues like rescuing the Emalahleni from spiraling into total darkness said MabuzaTNA Reporter
