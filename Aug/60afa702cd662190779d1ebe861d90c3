World stock markets spiralled lower on Tuesday after North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan, deepening geopolitical worries but sending the euro and gold hurtling higher.Pyongyang fired the missile over Japan and into the Pacific Ocean, in a major escalation that triggered global alarm and a furious response from Tokyo.Investor sentiment was also battered by monster storm Harvey in Texas, where it swamped streets and highways with unprecedented rainfall.&#8220;The combination of North Korea&#8217;s missile launch and the devastating impact of Harvey is weighing on risk appetite today,&#8221; Oanda analyst Craig Erlam told AFP.&#8220;Any increase in geopolitical risk, particularly involving North Korea, triggers a move to safety in markets as investors become increasingly concerned about the potential for things to escalate rapidly.&#8220;The damage caused in Houston is also weighing on sentiment, due to both the sheer devastation it has caused and the uncertainty over the cost and economic impact.&#8221;The shock developments sent investors fleeing for traditional safe-haven assets like the yen, gold, and US treasuries.The yen surged to four-month dollar peak and precious metal gold forged a path to a nine-month pinnacle at $1,326.16 per ounce.The euro topped $1.20 for the first time since January 2015, as traders also bet on the winding down of eurozone crisis-era stimulus measures and eyed growing economic optimism in the region.The single currency touched $1.2070 &#8212; which was the highest level since January 5, 2015.However, Asian and European stock markets crumbled as investors dumped risky equities.&#8211; &#8216;Flight to quality&#8217; &#8211;&#8220;Rising geopolitical tensions have prompted a flight to quality, benefiting safe haven assets at the expense of risk markets,&#8221; NFS Macro analyst Nick Stamenkovic told AFP.&#8220;The main beneficiaries have been US Treasuries, gold and the yen as investors flock to safety at least near term.&#8221;At the same time, the greenback has been hampered by ongoing uncertainty over US President Donald Trump&#8217;s tax-cutting plans, as well as North Korea developments.&#8220;Euro/dollar has hit its highest level since the first trading day of 2015 today and broken through the psychological $1.20 level along the way,&#8221; added Erlam.&#8220;It seems geopolitical risk and the devastation in Houston have turned people away from the dollar.&#8221;The greenback had already been suffering selling pressure as expectations for another Federal Reserve interest rate rise faded in recent weeks.Meanwhile, Tuesday&#8217;s missile test is the latest in a series of recent provocations by Pyongyang, testing US President Donald Trump, his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-In and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and raising fresh fears of conflict with the nuclear-armed nation.Back in the US, Harvey had battered into Texas as a Category Four hurricane on Friday, tearing down homes and businesses on the Gulf Coast, and triggering massive floods. It was later downgraded to a tropical storm.&#8211; Key figures around 1030 GMT &#8211;London &#8211; FTSE 100: DOWN 1.3 percent at 7,304.90 pointsFrankfurt &#8211; DAX 30: DOWN 1.8 percent at 11,901Paris &#8211; CAC 40: DOWN 1.5 percent at 5,005.60EURO STOXX 50: DOWN 1.4 percent at 3,372.20Tokyo &#8211; Nikkei 225: DOWN 0.5 percent at 19,362.55 (close)Hong Kong &#8211; Hang Seng: DOWN 0.4 percent at 27,765.01 (close)Shanghai &#8211; Composite: UP 0.1 percent at 3,365.23 (close)New York &#8211; Dow: FLAT at 21,808.40 (close)Euro/dollar: UP at $1.2062 from $1.1978 at 2100 GMT on MondayPound/dollar: UP at $1.2964 from $1.2933Dollar/yen: DOWN at 108.45 yen from 109.26 yenOil &#8211; Brent North Sea: DOWN 34 cents at $51.53 per barrelOil &#8211; West Texas Intermediate: DOWN four cents at $46.53&nbsp;AFP&nbsp;
