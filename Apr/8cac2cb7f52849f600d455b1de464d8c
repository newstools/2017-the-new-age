Individual brilliance and not collective effort might just save the season for Ajax Cape Town. More often than not this season the Urban Warriors have had to rely on the sheer brilliance of individuals for vital wins, when collective excellence has appeared inadequate.It was Mark Mayambela who guided the relegation-threatened Ajax to a 1-0 victory against Highlands Park last week. And when they looked headed for their 11th league defeat of the season, Prince Nxumalo nodded home to earn the Warriors a crucial 1-1 draw against Golden Arrows at the weekend. The Cape side are 10th with 26 points on the log, and even though their standing suggests they are in the safety zone, they are not.The have only won once this year and are four above the relegation zone with the margins between the lower-based teams quite close. Mayambela s role has been vital for the youngish Stanley Menzo side. Mark has to keep the shape and organisation and he does that, Menzo said. Lack of consistency has cost him international caps. Yet playing the full minutes of the last three games indicates that Mayambela has banished his troubles. Nothing has changed. Football is a game of opportunities and when you get that opportunity you ve got to use it to the best of your abilities, Mayambela said. We needed that win against Highlands. Before that game we hadn t won this year but we managed to win and I scored the winner. Without any fixtures lined up this week, Ajax will be back in action next Tuesday.-Kgomotso Sethusha|kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
