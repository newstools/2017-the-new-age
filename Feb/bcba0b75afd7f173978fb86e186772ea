After pulling out of the MTV Music Awards last year, devastated fans will be thrilled to know that South Africa s biggest comedy export, Trevor Noah, will be making his way back into the country later this year.The comedian is expected to do his version of Fill Up The Dome on August 10 and 11 in a comedy experience that has been endorsed by his employers at The Daily Show, Comedy Central (DStv channel 122).The show will feature his brand new comedy stand-up tour which features new and unheard material, detailing how his life has changed since taking up The Daily Show in September 2015.In a comedic Valentine s Day gift to his SA fans, Noah announced the news of his impending two-day special, with a special video message on Comedy Central social media sites yesterday afternoon.Speaking from his Daily Show desk, Noah said: I am coming back home to do a show, not because Donald Trump kicked me out, but because I would like to do a show for you at the Ticketpro Dome. New jokes, new show, special guests see you there! Noah has become DonaldTrump s biggest critic since news broke out that the American property mogul was contemplating a career as a politician and since then, he has gone on record to say Trump is a despotic leader.The comedy channel, through its director, Dillon Khan, said they were ecstatic about hosting the Johannesburg-born comedian on home soil. This is stand-up comedy on a scale never seen before, from a local comedian in this country and by far the biggest must-watch stand-up comedy event of the year, Khan said. Noah has sold out every local comedy tour he has done in SA since 2010 and we have no doubt that the same thing will happen at the Ticketpro Dome in August.The show s producer, Ryan Harduth, promised comedy fans a show like no other as far as the production values were concerned. We re going all out from a production standpoint to create the best comedy experience the Ticketpro Dome has ever seen, Harduth said. We will be showcasing local and international opening acts to support Trevor and we re incredibly excited to share this show with our audiences. SIYABONGA SITHOLE
