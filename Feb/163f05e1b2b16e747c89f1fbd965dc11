Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has announced that she is considering taking legal action against the Democratic Alliance (DA) for labeling her a spy. I have given the DA enough time to withdraw their spy allegations and will now take legal action, said Mkhwebane.The Public Protector made the announcement during a press briefing on Thursday where she reported back on her first 100 days in office.Previously, during Parliament&#8217;s intense search to appoint a candidate to replace Thuli Madonsela as the head of the chapter 9 institution, the DA was the only party not supporting Mkhwebane&#8217;s candidacy.DA MP Glynnis Breytenbach accussed Mkhwebane of being an agent of the State Security Agency.&#8220;We have been advised that the time spent as an immigration officer in China is also suspicious, having been informed that this is simply coded language for being on the payroll of SSA,&#8221; said Breytenbach.&#8220;In the absence of a logical explanation for what is seen as a demotion the ineluctable conclusion is unfortunately that Ms Mkhwebane is on the payroll of the SSA,&#8221; continued Breytenbach.Meanwhile Mkhwebane also said she was considering taking legal action against Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema who recently echoed the spy allegations against the Public Protector.Last month during a press briefing at the party&#8217;s headquarters, Malema remarked that the party had decided to endorse Mkhwebane s appointment despite having been told that she was a spy . I overlooked what I was told about her being a spy. We gave her a chance but now she s collapsing that office of the Public Protector, said Malema at the time.Mkwebane indicated that she took the allegations and half truths made against her seriously and was in the process of deciding whether to pursue the matter further.&#8220;I will be meeting the legal team soon and we will look into all the aspects whether it is defamation or contempt or parliamentary privilege will be invoked,&#8221; said Mkhwebane.-Siphiwe Mchunu
