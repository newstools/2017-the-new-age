Film provocateur Michael Moore will make his theatrical debut in a one-man show that explores the rise of US President Donald Trump and the resistance to him, producers announced Monday.&#8220;The Terms of My Surrender,&#8221; which will open in previews on July 28 at the Belasco Theatre on Broadway, was described as &#8220;an exhilarating, subversive one-man show guaranteed to take audiences on a ride through the United States of Insanity.&#8221;The show will explain how Trump emerged and &#8220;where best to dine before crossing over the mountains with the Von Trapp family into Canada,&#8221; the Belasco Theatre said in a statement, in an allusion to flight from Nazi-ruled Austria in &#8220;The Sound of Music.&#8221;&#8220;To unseat a president, it will take an act of Broadway,&#8221; it said.Moore, who had his start as a print journalist, has combined staunch left-wing activism with humorous personal asides in films such as &#8220;Bowling for Columbine,&#8221; which tackles US gun culture, and &#8220;Fahrenheit 9/11&#8221; which took aim at former president George W. Bush&#8217;s &#8220;war on terror.&#8221;Known for his slovenly look and ever-present baseball cap, Moore lives in his home state of Michigan. He accurately predicted last year that such industrial Midwestern states would swing the election to Trump at a time when most pundits thought the billionaire mogul stood no chance against Hillary Clinton.&#8220;The Terms of My Surrender&#8221; will be directed by Michael Mayer, who collaborated with punk rockers Green Day on their politically charged musical &#8220;American Idiot&#8221; and won a Tony Award for Duncan Sheik&#8217;s rock musical &#8220;Spring Awakening.&#8221;&#8220;I think what the world needs right now is Michael Moore standing on a Broadway stage sharing his hilarious stories and incendiary political perspective, creating the kind of dialogue that can only happen in the theater,&#8221; Mayer said in a statement.Nonetheless, Broadway can be unforgiving to famous names who try to make it. Pop star Sting and TV host Rosie O&#8217;Donnell are among celebrities whose live productions have struggled in recent years.-AFP
