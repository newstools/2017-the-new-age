MIKA MAHLAULERADICAL economic transformation (RET) is simplistically misrepresented to be a punitive construct which is meant to extract as much from the wealthy to give it to the poor. It is not.Businesses contribute greatly to the economy, GDP, jobs and so on. So why do we need our economy to be radically transformed? In a word, inequality.To fully understand this and adequately address the necessity for the radical transformation of our country we need to fully appreciate the role of the state in the economy as an enabler and not a stimulator. This is central to understanding RET.The World Bank describes South Africa as a dual economy with one of the highest inequality rates in the world, perpetuating both inequality and exclusion . In a report released in January Oxfam said that the total net wealth of just three billionaires in South Africa was equivalent to that of the bottom 50% percent of the country s population.The absurdity is quite depressing given our levels of poverty and inequality. The country was still one of the most unequal in the world, said OxfamSA economic justice manager Ayabonga Cawe.The report, titled An economy for the 99%, showed that the gap between rich and poor was far greater than feared. According to Oxfam, in SA the richest 1% of the population has 42% of the total wealth.Sipho Mthathi, Oxfam South Africa executive director, is reported to have said that despite the fact that such inequality is a sign of a broken economy, the South African government has the opportunity to help all of its citizens. The organisation believes authorities can build an economy where businesses pay their taxes and contribute to the wider good and enabling a healthy and educated society. The Oxfam report calls this the human economy.According to Statistics South Africa, the Gini coefficient measuring relative wealth reached 0.65 in 2014 based on expenditure data (excluding taxes), and 0.69 based on income data (including salaries, wages, and social grants). The poorest 20% of the South African population consume less than 3% of total expenditure, while the wealthiest 20% consume 65%.To transform the economy radically is crucial to break these historical economic patterns and fault lines and to shatter the chains of poverty.The struggle continues to be one that aims to fundamentally reverse the extreme inequalities generated and fostered by the apartheid government.This means empowering black people, especially Africans, eliminating poverty, generating jobs or job opportunities and advocacy and legislation towards a living wage to ensure a more balanced economic landscape in South Africa than what is now the case.We have a long way to go and the challenges the country faces is not going to be solved overnight.Gains made so far have been in the areas of basic services and in macroeconomic stabilisation, but real economic transformation is a long way from being realised.Radical economic transformation s success will depend largely on the efficacy and success of broad based black economic empowerment, the National Development Plan and the Black Industrialist Programme.It will also rely on the work done by the likes of the National Empowerment Fund.Over the past few years the National Empowerment Fund has entered into agreements with oil companies to facilitate the purchase of more service-station outlets by black entrepreneurs.Again, it is important to point out these occasions as they change the lives of individuals, their families, their communities and should serve as an inspiration to the majority of South Africans.Last year, the NEF told Parliament it would require an annual allocation of R2bn for the next five years to fulfil its mandate to promote black ownership of a still largely white dominated economy.A mere 3% of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) is in the hands of black South Africans. The NEF told Parliament that to reach 25% of black control required an additional 22% (of shares) worth R3.2 trillion of the market capitalisation of the JSE.If one is to look for where radical economic transformation can be gauged, a starting point should be the Black Industrialist Programme. The programme has supported 27 entrepreneurs and leveraged R2.5bn in private sector investment and created 5 235 direct jobs.And the government is starting to look more closely at BBBEE deals in that they are not just window dressing opportunities, but a driver of real change in the economy.Also, more scrutiny is being placed on these deals all transactions with a value of R25m or more must now be registered with the BBBEE Commission as per Code Series 100 of the Amended Codes of Good Practice. Previously, the threshold for BBBEE ownership transactions was R100m.A major increase in black participation in the economy needs to happen if the country is to weather the storms of global financial crises more effectively, whether it is in training unemployed solar installers, increasing the number of black owned and managed petrol station owners, for example, or in trying to increase the number of black industrialists.Simply put, economic transformation is crucial to all who live in South Africa and the government needs to continue to pursue programmes and objectives that uphold socioeconomic objectives that benefit and uplift the millions of citizens it is mandated to serve.Until black South Africans become meaningful contributors and participants in the business value chains, the economy will never be able to reach its full potential.Transformative economic policies are therefore a necessary remedy to stimulate broader participation in the growth and development of South Africa.South Africa s economy needs to be rebuilt from the bottom up, not from the top down. As we can see, big business in South Africa is far too closely linked to the government at all levels. The results are often to the detriment of the poor.Until inequality is dealt with in the economy, radical economic transformation is here to stay so that more than just a handful get to be in control of the wealth of this country. To be prosperous we need shared responsibility to help build the economy from grass roots.Mika Mahlaule is a ANCYL national executive committee member and is head of the education and health subcommittee of the ANCYL
