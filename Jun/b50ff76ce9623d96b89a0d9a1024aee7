Residents of ward 45 in the city of Mbombela were applauded by the ANC s provincial leadership for their support, which resulted in the party winning the by-election last week.The ruling party managed to retain control of the ward after achieving 88.45% of the vote.The Economic Freedom Fighters received 11.55% of the vote.The by-election was held following the resignation of the ANC ward councillor due to undisclosed circumstances.ANC provincial secretary Mandla Ndlovu said the victory should be regarded as a clear indication that the majority of citizens in the province still relied on the ANC as their only political party of choice intended to enhance their lives through the provision of sustainable services.Ndlovu said they were satisfied with the outcomes of the by-election and the ANC would continue to deliver since it was a party of the people with an extended view in terms of creating a better life for all. The ANC in Mpumalanga welcomes the by-election results with glee. We thank these voters for responding to our call and going out in numbers to vote for the ANC and ensuring that it is receiving a landslide victory of 88.45%. Their commitment to the ANC ensured that the ANC throttles political newcomers, the EFF, which obtained a mere 11.55%. We also assure them that their votes were not in vain and are not taken for granted. The votes will be used to intensify our fight for a better life for all. This election victory is a clear message that our people only trust the ANC in the fight against poverty, unemployment and inequality, Ndlovu said.He said the branches of the ANC had also played a key role in influencing the supporters on the ground during the campaigns. We salute all election structures of the ANC, in particular the branch election teams and volunteers of our movement for their dedication and commitment without which this victory would not have been possible. We urge our structures not to stop interacting with the electorate now that there are no elections but to continue engaging them as we are governing to give full meaning to the prescript, the people shall govern. Meanwhile, the ANC was hard at work on the ground intensifying its campaign ahead of the by-election to be held in ward six of the Emakhazani local municipality next Wednesday.FRANCE NYAKAfrancen@thewage.co.za
