The African National Congress in the Eastern Cape is shocked by ANC members who held Deputy Minister of Rural Development Mcebisi Skwatsha hostage in the Nelson Mandela region.ANC provincial secretary Oscar Mabuyane said they are aware that the protests were well-orchestrated to disrupt the appeal process of branches on the outcomes of the branch general meetings in the Metro.&#8220;What shocked us the most was the presence of one ward councillor and PR councillor amongst the protesters, whose branches were not supposed to be part of the appeals on the day as they were already dealt with on Friday by the National NEC Team as led by Cde Mcebisi Skwatsha,&#8221; said Mabuyane.Mcebisi Skwatsha was held hostage at the Nelson Mandela Bay ANC headquarters on Saturday.Skwatsha had been deployed to the Nelson Mandela region to resolve infighting about which representatives would attend the party s upcoming provincial conference.It is reported that the situation turned truculent after there were claims that Skwatsha began to favour certain members before the rest of the people in attendance were allowed to voice their concerns.Mabuyane said the ANC PEC condemns such behavior and calls for a halt for such atrocious displays of dissatisfaction.&#8220;Such makes the mockery of the right to protest and diminishes the stature of grievance and the genuine issues that may be raised. Immediately if there are any members of the ANC involved in such action, they must desist from this behavior or face investigation and disciplinary action by the organisation,&#8221; he said.Skwatsha was escorted out of the building about an hour after the conference started.&#8220;We are sending a strong message to all ANC members, that anyone who participates in violent protests and other acts of anarchy and ill-discipline will face the full might of the organisation,&#8221; he said.TNA Reporter&nbsp;
