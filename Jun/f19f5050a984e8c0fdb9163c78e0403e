Five disgruntled ANC regions in the Western Cape have called on the party to formally disband its provincial executive committee and also to remove Derek Hanekom as part of a caretaker leadership team.In an uncompromising stand yesterday, they also spoke out against factionalism and accused provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs, Hanekom and a group called Unity in Diversity of not acting in the best interest of the ANC.They also accused the elements in the Western Cape leadership of trying to hijack the elected delegation due to attend next week s policy conference in Gauteng and replace them with their own unelected candidates.The five are Dullah Omar, Boland, Central Karoo, West Coast and Overberg districts. They were joined in their position by the ANC Women s League and Youth League at a press conference held in Cape Town yesterday.They said that they had been branded as Jacob Zuma supporters, but were adamant that they would not allow these allegations to derail them.The chairperson of the ANC s biggest region Dullah Omar, Xolani Sothase, said the group of five had observed anti ANC activities in the province. We ve said we can t fold our arms when the movement goes down. The unfortunate situation is the continuation of factions that are at loggerheads, Sothase said.The results of the 2016 local government elections did paint a good picture of us in terms of reclaiming power . We all know there is a problem in the organisation, a problem of factionalism that must be rooted out. A problem of people who think they own the ANC. We ll be failing the constituency we represent if we do not speak out. History will judge us harshly because the future generations will ask us why did you keep quiet when you knew the ANC was going down? news@thenewage.co.za
