The ANC in the Western Cape has refused to be drawn into whom it would back to take over from President Jacob Zuma as the party s succession debate gains momentum.The party s provincial executive committee (PEC) met last week to discuss several issues, including the ANC s national elective conference scheduled for December.In its deliberations, the PEC has warned that pronouncements on preferred candidates undermined the party s integrity.ANC acting provincial chairperson Khaya Magaxa said this stance created an atmosphere of anarchy. Anybody who is making pronouncements in relation to leadership (question) in the ANC is not concerned about the necessity to unite our organisation, Magaxa said.Secretary Faiez Jacobs said the PEC believed the party should thoroughly discuss who it wanted to lead the organisation nationally.Magaxa confirmed Marius Fransman had appealed for his position as the ANC provincial chairperson and the integrity commission would hear his appeal at the end of the month.He said the PEC condemned the conduct of Fransman, and that his recent actions showed gross regard for the ANC structures.There are three potential candidates in the pipelines for the position of provincial chairperson but that will depend on the outcome of Fransman s appeal. The web of corporate capture is extremely corrosive and erodes our sovereignty and confidence of our people. Any leader s name that was stated in the report will have to answer to the integrity commission regardless of who the leader is as in the ANC we are all leaders that have the same rules applying to all to safeguard the ANC S integrity. We also condemn the politicisation of law enforcement agencies within the ANC, Magaxa saidPreparations for February 1 by-elections in George wards 11 and 24 are underway. The provincial celebrations have galvanised the community there. Western Cape structures will meet in April to discuss the leadership battles.Tatenda Chiriseritatendac@thenewage.co.za
