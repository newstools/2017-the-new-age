African National Congress (ANC) Provincial chairperson in KwaZulu-Natal Sihle Zikalala has called for an urgent referendum on the expropriation of land without compensation.Zikalala was addressing the KZN legislature during State of the Province Address (SOPA) Debate on Thursday.He told members of the legislature that the issues of land can no longer be delayed, as that was ANC policy. Because the land question is so important such that it cannot be left to members of Parliament alone, including the dishonest ones who opportunistically mouth, cheap soundbites on the land question meant to grab media headlines from the opposition benches, as the ANC we call for a referendum on the expropriation of land without compensation.We do so because we believe that our democracy is premised on the principle that the people must govern and, therefore, any radical policy propositions must be anchored on the will of the people, Zikalala said.The party said it is motivated by President Jacob Zuma s speech at the State of the National Address (SONA) in which he said government must adopt a radical approach on land reform as to get the desired results.The provincial chairperson encourages ANC s allies to be fearless and speak out on challenges the organisation is facing.&#8220;Whilst we engage on the proposed referendum, we must be encouraged by the Muden Community in KwaZulu-Natal that is forging ahead with the 50/50 voluntary land share programme which brings together the Muden community and the farmer in the area.&#8220;This is a step in the right direction towards transferring not only skills but ownership to the majority of people in line with the Freedom Charter that the Land shall be shared by those who work it, Zikalakala added.&#8211;TNA Reporter
