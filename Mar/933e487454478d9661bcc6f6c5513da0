The province has made significant strides in its battle against HIV and Aids.A recently published report on the state of public healthcare facilities conducted by the Health Systems Trust, showed that the province did particularly well in the distribution of male condoms, HIV testing coverage and reducing mother to child transmission of HIV.During 2015 and last year the province was the leading distributor of male condoms for the second year in a row, with an average of 54.6% condoms per male aged 15 years and older.The Umzinyathi district, located in the north and central areas of the province, was ahead of the other districts with a coverage at 136.3% condoms for every male, with half of the 10 best-performing districts coming from the province.Despite this, the report said condom use was declining, citing the finding of the last national household survey conducted in 2012, which showed that a lot of men and women stopped using condoms at the last sex act. Some of the challenges impeding the effectiveness of condoms in preventing HIV transmission are the inconsistent and incorrect use of condoms and the likelihood that couples in longer-term relationships discontinue the use of condoms, the report said.On HIV testing coverage, the province had the third highest testing coverage after Limpopo (39.1%) and the Eastern Cape (37.3%).It stood above the national average of 34.5%, despite taking a huge cut of 3%.Again, Umzinyathi district (52%) was one of the four districts that reached coverage of more than 50%, despite also shedding more than 10%.Meanwhile, eThekwini and Umgungundlovu were the only two districts in the province to record an increase.The report said there were still major research gaps about the best way to provide HIV counselling and testing, especially to the youth as they had historically exhibited a lower uptake of HIV testing services. There is a particular need to target this group, especially young women and adolescent girls who bear a disproportionate burden of HIV in South Africa, the report said.Also, the province had the highest percentage of HIV-infected pregnant women who received antiretroviral therapy.TB remains the main source of death among people living with HIV with around 70% of patients with TB in South Africa also infected with HIV.Even though the province failed to meet the national average of 94.8%, it ranked among the top five.Close to 95% TB patients with known HIV status visited the facilities in the province.-TNA REPORTER
