AnalysisWesley SealeRating agencies are instruments with political choices.In the past 48 hours, Moody s once again downgraded SA long term foreign and local currency debt rating from Baa2 to Baa3.Rating agencies have become a reality for sovereign nations and their citizenry. Yet what recourse do countries have when a rating agency wilfully subverts the decision making processes as it suits a specific financial and political agenda?Moody s downgrading of China and then Hong Kong is a case in point.China is a global financial powerhouse with aims to establish alternatives to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. For a while these two Bretton Woods institutions have been criticised for being too western.In fact, the most glaring example of western manipulation is the gentleman s agreement between Europe and the US that the former will choose the candidate to head the IMF whereas the latter chooses the head of the World Bank.They are able to maintain this gentleman s agreement because of the governance structure of these two institutions favour the West.At the same time, China also has and promotes its own rating agency.China s sovereignty is once again being challenged and questioned by Moody s, a western agency, whose clear intention and objective is as shameful as it is questionable.The same rating agency subsequently downgraded Hong Kong s sovereign credit rating, citing its ties with China. Moody s indicated that any weakening of China s creditworthiness will continue to have a significant impact on Hong Kong s credit profile due to close and tightening economic, financial and political links with the mainland .The agency went on to indicate that the downgrade also reflected its view that China s rising debt would have a significant impact on Hong Kong because of these close ties.The Hong Kong rating came only a few days after Moody s downgraded China and is made, no doubt, to create tension between Hong Kong and the rest of China.At the same time it is important to remember that China owns a fair chunk of US debt.As of September 2014, foreigners owned more than $6 trillion, approximately 47%, of public debt, which stood at more than $12 trillion. At the same time, they also owned 34% of total US debt of nearly $18 trillion.The largest foreign holders were China, Japan, Belgium, the Caribbean banking centres and oil exporters.US debt to China stood at over $1.2 trillion, as of April last year. In other words, 30% of the US s $4 trillion in Treasury bills, notes, and bonds held by foreign countries, was held by China alone.The rest of the $19 trillion debt is owned either by the American people or the US government itself.So, why would Moody s downgrade a country and region if it clearly has more capital than the US, which is clearly on autopilot under Donald Trump?It is important to remember that the West continues to mourn its loss of Hong Kong.The city is no longer an outpost of the British Empire and gained independence from the UK in 1997.Beijing took over control of Hong Kong, because it belonged to China but afforded the city the opportunity to maintain, among others, its separate financial system and its own currency.Hong Kong is officially known as the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People s Republic of China .China, on the other hand, is also part of the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (Brics) bloc, which continues to grow and which is a threat to Western financial behemoths but a boon to the developing world s financial future.While the term Bric was coined by Goldman Sachs economist, Jim O Neill, in the early 2000s, it was meant for investors looking to invest into the globes biggest so-called emerging economies. South Africa joined in the late 2000s.Brics is and is proving to be the antithesis of the western dominated institutions, such as Moody s, and who have a western country bias.For example, these are the same west-biased rating agencies who, before the financial meltdown of 2008, gave Greece, a main culprit in the crisis and which colluded with corrupt bankers on Wall Street, an AAA+ rating, knowing full well that the country was swimming in an ocean of debt and that very little legal tender was circulating in its economy.These agencies trade off on an illusion of wealth. An illusion of wealth, simply put, means debt.In recent years, O Neill has had to remark that the Brics countries collectively are bigger today even in the most optimistic scenario I thought 15 years ago, and it s primarily because of China .China with its soft power foreign policy is the game changer. With a middle-class of nearly 1 billion people and its protectionist capitalist system, the Middle Kingdom rules the world s economic landscape.In 2015, the Chinese government announced that it would establish the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank a new funding vehicle, which ostensibly was set up for Asian countries to rival the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.With the same intention of dumping these pro-west institutions, the Brics Bank was also established recently.The Chinese had also, in the same year, said it would mobilise a thousand of its finance scholars with the express purpose of setting up a ratings agencies which would be less west-centric than Moody s, S&amp;P and Fitch. This thinking, of setting up an alternative ratings agency, stemmed from the 2008 global credit crisis and the rating agencies complicity in the crisis.Delegates at the World Credit Rating Forum stressed the need for a more transparent global credit rating system.The forum, which included former presidents all agreed that the global credit crisis showed that the credit ratings assigned by the incumbent credit ratings agencies cannot be relied on to rate the world. The international community has to construct a new international rating system .Former French prime minister Dominique de Villepin said at the forum that the world would suffer another financial meltdown if there were no reform in the ratings agencies.China is being punished for daring to take on the old money and old order from the West.The Chinese influence is found in almost every country on earth whether it is to find a cure for malaria, reopening of trade routes, building infrastructure or sending doctors and nurses into Africa first after the Ebola outbreak.The country is clearly a threat to the west and the established order.While it won t declare war on China, the west will use nefarious methods through unscrupulous agencies like Moody s in its attempts to destabilise China.The Chinese, however, are fairly insulated given their history and their ability to look after their own industries.While China may be able to fend off the sharks that are the rating s agencies, given its massive consumer base and cash-rich reserves, the rest of the developing world, including South Africa, remain vulnerable to these western-backed bullies who have vested and narrowed agendas.More importantly, the combined monopoly of Moody s, Fitch and S&amp;P, constitute 96% of the global rating market and needs to be challenged by either the Brics bloc or a host of developing nations.What is clear is that the Chinese have the established western order rattled to the point where the west will revert to a winner takes all approach, with little or no regard to facts which may cause harm to emerging economies.As the attacks on the Zuma administration grew, South Africans would have become more familiar with these rating institutions and their subsequent action of reducing the country s borrowing status to junk.Citing mainly political instability and high rates of unemployment, South Africa s sovereign credit rating was downgraded.Dare we suggest that the real reason for the downgrades is the resolve by the Zuma administration to remain committed to our Brics allies, and the Chinese in particular.Wesley SealeWesley Seale teachers politics at Rhodes University
