Members of the Black Lawyers Association have taken their plight to the seat of government calling for an end to allegedly being disregarded for government business. This morning, the BLA are gathering at the Union Buildings in Pretoria for a meeting with the Presidency. The association has previously bemoaned the seeming lack of confidence in black and women legal practitioners to handle cases on behalf of government. According to BLA the march is directed to the Head of State on the basis that the state is the biggest consumer of legal services in the country. Last year the BLA said President Zuma’s government had no regard for black legal practitioners after it was announced that council representing him in the Nkandla case would be Advocate Jeremy Gauntlett SC. “We are continually informed that the big amount of the government litigation work goes to black advocates. We do not see the beneficiaries of those briefs and we are not told how much such briefs are worth in terms of rand value,” said BLA president Lutendo Sigogo at the time. Chairperson of the Advocates for Transformation, Advocate Dumisa Ntsebeza SC has also previously been a vocal critic of the lack of government briefs for black lawyers. -TNA Reporter
