New manager Jorge Sampaoli says he is looking to superstar Lionel Messi to revive Argentina&#8217;s World Cup fortunes starting with Friday&#8217;s friendly with Brazil in Melbourne.Sampaoli has been installed to kick-start the two-time world champions&#8217; ailing South American campaign where they lag outside the automatic qualifying positions in fifth spot with four games left.Argentina will square off with Brazil before a capacity 100,000 crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground ahead of their crucial next qualifier in Uruguay on August 31.Sampaoli, who is Argentina&#8217;s third coach during the current World Cup campaign after Gerardo Martino and Edgardo Bauza, said he valued Messi&#8217;s commitment to get his country to next year&#8217;s World Cup finals in Russia.&#8220;I&#8217;m very thankful that the best player in the world cut short his vacation in China and was able to travel here for a friendly,&#8221; Sampaoli told reporters on Thursday.&#8221;He has the will to participate and drive Argentina to the World Cup, so he s very much involved toward these goals.&#8220;The things that he s done for the team, especially this time round, are really valuable.&#8221;I really hope that the abilities that he shows as a leader and as a player will help Argentina improve.&#8221;Sampaoli wants to use the Melbourne match to see Messi and Paris Saint-Germain&#8217;s Angel Di Maria work together.&#8220;They are very good players, individually, and these friendly games give us the opportunity to test their compatibility and see how well they can work together,&#8221; Sampaoli said.&#8220;They re both great players and we have great expectations. I believe that they will be able to help the team.&#8221; Never a friendly But Inter Milan striker Mauro Icardi, recalled to the Argentine squad for the first time since 2013, is in doubt for Friday&#8217;s match with a thigh injury.Sampaoli said he was keen for Icardi to at least play a few minutes &#8220;but unfortunately the doctor is not on the same page&#8221;.&#8220;So it doesn t matter how strongly we want him to play if the medical advice is to the contrary. We re hoping for a miracle in the next 24 hours for him to be able to play at least a few minutes.&#8221;Despite the match being classified as a friendly, the former Sevilla manager said his players were committed to show how well they can play, particularly against their arch-rival.&#8220;They want to play very strongly to demonstrate that they really value coming here as a team and there s also the aspect of playing a very strong rival team,&#8221; he said.Brazil, who have already qualified for next year&#8217;s World Cup, are without their talisman Neymar but Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho said they were hellbent not to lose their edge against Argentina.&#8220;Brazil and Argentina is never a friendly, everybody wants to win and we know how important this is being a classic,&#8221; Fernandinho said.&#8221;We need to continue in our rhythm, but Argentina has a new coach and he had really good work with Chile and Sevilla. This is more motivation for them.&#8221;Paris Saint-Germain defender Thiago Silva said he was lookig forward to the challenge of containing Messi. It s very difficult to play against a player like Messi. Lately I ve had to do it many times, every year in the Champions League,&#8221; Silva told reporters late Thursday.&#8220;I think tomorrow s game is not him playing for Barcelona, it s Brazil versus Argentina, and it s not a friendly game, both sides will be very motivated. -AFP
