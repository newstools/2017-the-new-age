Springbok scrum half Faf de Klerk signed a three-year contract with English Premiership side Sale Sharks because his South African Super Rugby Lions team could not match the financial package, the team&#8217;s chief executive said on Thursday.A weak rand currency has spurred a stream of South African players to leave the country for teams in Europe.&#8220;The player made a personal request to be released to further his career abroad and we felt we couldn t stand in his way while. We also couldn t match the offer he received,&#8221; said Rudolf Straeuli, chief executive officer of the Lions Rugby Company.Straeuli said de Klerk would move to Sale once the Super Rugby season had concluded.&#8220;Faf is still very important in our Super Rugby campaign as he plays a vital role in our squad system.&#8221;De Klerk joined the Lions in 2014 and has made 58 Super Rugby appearances, scoring 12 tries.After last year s Super Rugby campaign, 45 players left South African clubs to play overseas, either on long term contacts at clubs in Britain, France and Ireland or on short-term deals in Japan.This year s SA Rugby Annual lists 311 South Africans playing rugby outside of the country in 2016.In a bid to halt the exodus, the South African Rugby Union has said it will no longer select overseas-based players who have won fewer than 30 caps, though it is tempered by a rule that says the coach retains the right in a Rugby World Cup year to select any player he believes is essential to the campaign.At the time the rule was introduced, Mark Alexander, president of SA Rugby said he was &#8220;sending a message to young players that if they wish to play for the Springboks, then they must remain in South Africa. -Reuters
