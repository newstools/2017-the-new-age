While all eyes are fixed on the National Assembly it appears it’s business as usual for President Jacob Zuma who today has reappointed, Terrence Nombembe, as a non-executive director of the Board of the South African Reserve Bank for three years. Nombembe holds the distinction of being the first African to be appointed as Auditor-General in the history of the organisation in 2006 before being replaced by current AG Kimi Makwetu in 2013. Recently Nombembe featured as part of a newly formed civil society coalition called FutureSA including among others Sydney Mufamadi, Sipho Pityana, Ela Gandhi and Bonang Mohale. According to the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, Nombembe forms part of the ‘patrons’ of the civil society group. “We are urging all South Africans to come out in their numbers on August 8. We are calling for a lunchtime shutdown on the day. From 12 pm to 2 pm we want ordinary people – be they at home, at the workplace or at school – to take to the streets and make their voices heard. For those in Cape Town, we urge you to join the march to parliament against Zuma,” the coalition said in a statement. Nombembe was born in Qumbu in 1961 and matriculated at the Mthatha Technical College in 1979 and he qualified as a CA in 1990. He currently serves as the chief executive officer of the SA Institute of Chartered Accountants (Saica). -TNA Reporter
