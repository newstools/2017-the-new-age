A woman in Mpumalanga has been in hiding for the past three years after she was allegedly kidnapped and nearly killed by her white business partner.Thabitha Sibanyoni, a single mother of three, claims she survived the ordeal after one of her kidnappers recognised her as someone who had been helpful to his family years before.Sibanyoni is a 52% shareholder at Semfra Construction CC. Her business partner, Petrus Fran ois Cilliers, owns 48% of the company. Semfra has been operating since 2003 and is contracted to Eskom with a turnover averaging R48m a year.Animosity between Sibanyoni and Cilliers started in 2012 when the SA Revenue Service (SARS) audited Semfra and found a shortfall of R4.6m. Sibanyoni says she had to borrow R400000, ceding her personal property valued at R1.5m to rescue Semfra.Sibanyoni s woes worsened when Cilliers refused to help her repay the loan. Cilliers went behind my back and wrote to the bank to cease my account on August 7, 2014. Sibanyoni was then told by the company registration office Cipro, that she was no longer a member of Semfra Construction.After this, Sibanyoni was given the run around and said that from October 2014 payments from Eskom were diverted into Cilliers private account. She went to the police and laid charges.A meeting with a business associate was abruptly interrupted by two armed men who called her by name.Sibanyoni says: We were forced into the back of their car and they drove behind Paxton Prison, where we were saved by one kidnapper recognising me. He confessed they were sent by my business partner to assassinate me. They were paid a deposit of R50000 and drugs, with the promise of R100000 on completion of the murder. The kidnappers then had the idea of faking Sibanyoni s death by slaughtering a chicken and smearing blood on her face. They then took a photo which was sent to Cilliers, she said. They allowed her to escape and she took refuge in Barberton before making her way to Gauteng.Sello Rabothata
