A bumper harvest in maize crop is expected this year as a result of recent rains and consumers who have been struggling with sky-high maize prices at the supermarket shelves are likely to reap the rewards.Recent rainfall suggests the country could possibly harvest more and other good news is that colder weather, rain and resilient genetically-modified crops have limited the damage caused by an army worm outbreak in South Africa. Limpopo and North West were the most affected by the caterpillars, which spread southward from neighbouring countries after first being detected in Nigeria last year.Consumers are likely to reap the benefit of lower prices in the second quarter of this year, as good rain spells better maize output and limit imports. According to the government s Crop Estimates Committee (CEC), the country s maize is expected to rise by more than 79% this year, This will bring huge relief given the fact that the price of 10kg maize meal went up by 23.1% last year as a result of the drought which helped push the food-price inflation rate to almost 12% in August last year, which was the highest in five years.South Africa will likely to harvest 13.92 million tons of maize this year, 79% more than last year as improved rain has boosted production. The CEC forecast is 6% higher than market expectations of 13.11 million tons, according to a Reuters poll of traders. Last year, farmers reaped 7.78 million tons of maize, 22% less than the previous harvest, pushing up food prices and fuelling inflation after a scorching drought triggered by an El Ni o weather pattern.Favourable weather conditions brought on by a La Ni a weather system have brought increased rainfall over the maize belt during the summer growing season. Prices for the staple white maize have more than halved from record peaks of over 5000 rand a ton scaled early last year and have fallen below R2000 a ton, which could help lower food inflation.However, going forward poses another threat as the South African weather authorities last week warned the El Ni o may return in spring, which usually occurs from August to October. Christo Joubert, a manager at the National Agricultural Marketing Council, said a bumper harvest would see South Africa having enough and more white maize to carry the country forward as last year s stock will run until end of April this year.Analysts said enough maize will improve the picture as the drought pushes lower income earners to be 10% poorer than a year ago, with inflation clocking to 6.8% in December before turning the corner to 6.6% last month. This suggests that drought conditions experienced in the main maize producing areas of the country which manifested in a deterioration in crop yield prospects last year, are now painting a picture of a glimmer of hope and thanks to the rains, Joubert said.However, experts urge consumers to be patient as prices takes time before they come down at supermarkets. with Reuters bernards@thenewage.co.za
