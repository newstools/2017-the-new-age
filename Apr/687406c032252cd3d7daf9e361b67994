We want this to end with as much peace as we can bring to this right now, and we want him to turn himself in,&#8221; Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams told reporters, adding that local authorities were working with the FBI and regional law enforcement.&#8220;We have all of our partners in on this, and we&#8217;ll look until we find him,&#8221; Williams said.Mayor Frank Jackson told reporters police were still trying to communicate with the suspect.&#8220;We want to communicate to him that we know who he is, and that he will eventually be caught. And that we&#8217;re saying to him that he need not do any more,&#8221; said Jackson.Stephens was at large after fleeing in a white Ford Fusion with temporary license plates, police in the midwestern US city said.Some local media reported that he had boasted on Facebook of killing more than a dozen people in an Easter Day massacre, but authorities said there was no indication of a broader killing spree.-AFP
