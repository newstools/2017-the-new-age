The National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) is still waiting for answers from the Walter Sisulu University to explain on what happened with the R14 million allowance that was allegedly credited by error to a NSFAS-funded student at the university.NSFAS Acting Executive Officer Lerato Nage said they requested the institution to write a an official report to them. We wrote a letter and urged the university management to submit an official report as soon as possible to enable us to provide factual information to our funders, stakeholders, and the students. We have also submitted a NSFAS Report to the Minister of Higher Education and Training, Dr Blade Nzimande, based on our remittance account on Walter Sisulu University (WSU). NSFAS is, at the moment, not involved in third-party agreements that institutions enter into with their preferred suppliers for rendering of services. Institutions use their own autonomy and prerogative in their supply chain systems. It is important that we note that Intellimali is not a NSFAS service provider, but a WSU service provider. We have noted that Intellimali has taken responsibility for this error, said Nage.NSFAS said it will roll out its own allowance disbursement system called sBux to the rest of the institutions in the country next year.sBux directly disburses allowances to NSFAS funded-students at different universities and TVET colleges, so that they can transact at participating stores nationwide, using their cell phones. WSU is not on the sBux programme as a result allowances for their students are paid to the university.At the beginning of June, Sibongile Mani had money from NSFAS mistakenly deposited into her account. Mani went on shopping spree and spent over R800,000 on luxury goods.
