Toshiba&#8217;s shares skyrocketed over 22 percent Wednesday on hopes it will unload a stake in its prized chip business to shore up a battered balance sheet.The rebound follows a more than 20 percent slide in the Tokyo-listed stock last week as one of Japan&#8217;s best-known firms warned over huge losses and a probe into the accounting at US nuclear arm Westinghouse Electric.On Wednesday, the shares jumped 22.31 percent to end the day at 224.7 yen ($2), as Japan&#8217;s Nikkei business daily said that Toshiba has asked potential bidders to peg its chip division&#8217;s value at two trillion yen ($17.6 billion) or more.The firm on Tuesday said it has completed the 31.4 billion yen sale of its medical finance unit to copier and camera maker Canon.But with concerns mounting over Toshiba&#8217;s precarious financial situation, the stock rally was not likely to last, said Toshikazu Horiuchi, a broker at IwaiCosmo Securities.&#8221;Today&#8217;s move is likely to be an exception &#8212; the volatility will continue for the time being,&#8221; he added.Toshiba shares are down by about half since late December, when it first warned of big losses at Westinghouse.A chip division sale is seen as crucial for Toshiba &#8212; which declined comment on the Nikkei report &#8212; to raise cash as it struggles with multi-billion-dollar losses.Last week, Toshiba issued a grim preliminary forecast of a net loss of 390 billion yen in the fiscal year to March, dragged by a writedown topping $6 billion at Westinghouse.Toshiba also said it opened probe into possible wrongdoing by the unit&#8217;s senior executives while chairman Shigenori Shiga, who once headed Westinghouse, quit his post.Less than two years ago, Toshiba suffered an embarrassing profit-padding scandal that involved bosses pressuring subordinates to cover up weak earnings.-AFP&nbsp;
