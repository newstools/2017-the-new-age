BMW Group says it will deploy 40 self-driving vehicles for tests in the United States and Europe.The German auto group made the announcement jointly with US computer chip giant Intel and the Israeli-based auto technology firm Mobileye at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas Wednesday.&#8220;Making autonomous driving a reality for our customers is the shared ambition behind our cooperation with Intel and Mobileye,&#8221; said BMW board member Klaus Froehlich in a statement, who said the tests would be a major step toward achieving a fully autonomous vehicle by 2021.&#8220;This partnership has all of the skills and talent necessary to overcome the enormous technological challenges ahead and commercialize self-driving vehicles. Therefore, we are already thinking in terms of scalability and welcome other companies &#8212; manufacturers, suppliers or technology companies to participate and contribute to our autonomous platform.&#8221;The companies said they plan to begin testing by the end of this year, joining autonomous vehicles from Google&#8217;s Waymo, Uber and others being used in real-traffic situations. BMW Group will be responsible for driving control, safety and the production of the car platform.Intel will offer its Intel Go computing platform that uses a variety of sensors and other data to power the brains of the car. Mobileye will be using its proprietary EyeQ5 computer vision processor which gets input from the 360-degree surround view sensors as well as localization.&#8220;From an industry perspective, we are already seeing savings and speed in development by sharing development costs and in pooling resources to develop a complete autonomous platform,&#8221; Intel chief executive Brian Krzanich said. &#8220;That&#8217;s why this partnership is breaking new ground. We have established a dedicated team with clear, shared goals and a culture of innovation and agility and accountability.&#8221;Nearly all the major global automakers are involved in testing or autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicles, with some expecting full autonomy within a few years.-AFP
