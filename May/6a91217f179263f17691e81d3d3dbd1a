Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba has expressed concern at the growing number of smokers, saying they ran the risk of developing health complications, thus putting a strain on the province s health resources.In her World No Tobacco Day message yesterday, Ramathuba urged communities to take care of their health and avoid unnecessary risks such as smoking. Smoking increases the risk of cancer, heart and respiratory diseases and other illnesses. All these can be avoided if people stopped smoking, Ramathuba said. There is a growing trend among young people, who think smoking is cool. I doubt there is anyone who thinks killing yourself is cool, Ramathuba said.Despite the call to observe World No Tobacco Day by not smoking, people in Polokwane continued to puff away yesterday. Tommy Mashako, 52, said: I enjoy my cigarette and will not stop any time soon. I smoke about 10 to 15 cigarettes a day. Being unemployed, sometimes three or four of us share one cigarette. This is a nice habit although I regret starting it. Now I have reached the point of no return. Samuel Mathebula, 60, of Bloodriver village, said he started smoking at 15 because he wanted to be like his uncles. The government contradicts itself. It says we should stop smoking but encourages farmers, including those who grow tobacco, to employ people. If we stop smoking, who will buy tobacco? According to the Tobacco Institute of Southern Africa, there are 7.7 million smokers in South Africa, of which 6.3 million are over the age of 18. Health authorities also discourage people from taking snuff tobacco which, like cigarettes, increases the risk of heart disease and certain cancers.MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
