The Speaker of Parliament Baleka Mbete and National Council of Provinces Chairperson Thandi Modise have expressed their condolences following the passing of former MP struggle stalwart Laloo Chiba. “On behalf of Parliament, we offer our heartfelt condolences to Mr Chiba’s wife, Luxmi, his daughters and grandchildren and his comrades and friends,” they said in a statement. The former struggle hero died on Friday in Johannesburg at the age of 87. Chiba was first elected as an MP in the country’s first democratic elections in 1994 and was again re-elected in the 1999 elections. The struggle veteran was a member of the South African Communist Party, the Transvaal Indian Congress and a commander of the MKMVA. Together with the former President Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Ahmed Kathrada and others, he was incarcerated at the Robben Island. He was imprisoned at the Robben Island for 18 years. After his release from Prison he went on to lead the United Democratic Front which was launched in Cape Town in 1983. “While the passing of this veteran of our struggle for democracy leaves a painful void, it must serve as a reminder to rededicate ourselves to the ideals for which our struggle stalwarts stood,’ said Parliament in a statement. After his retirement from Parliament Chiba continued to serve the country in the quest for a non-racial, non-sexist, democratic and prosperous society in various platforms. At the time of his passing he was also serving as a board member of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation. -TNA Reporter
