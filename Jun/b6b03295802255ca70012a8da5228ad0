The provision of quality healthcare to our patients remains one of our top priorities, KwaZulu-Natal Premier Willies Mchunu said today.Mchunu made these remarks ahead of his announcement on interventions to turn around the situation in the department of health. Our hearts are with patients and families who have been affected by the crisis that has plagued oncology services in this province,&#8221; Mchunu said.This comes after the Democratic Alliance (DA) stated that it wanted the KwaZulu-Natal health MEC Dr Sibongiseni Dhlomo to face culpable homicide charges over the deaths of cancer patients.Since 2011, many patients died while waiting for the provincial health department to fix radiotherapy equipment. Critically in these meeting we have agreed that there is an urgent need for a decisive intervention to ensure the provision of quality patient care to patients that are in need of oncology services,&#8221; Mchunu saidThe provincial executive council subsequently received briefings from the MEC for finance and MEC for health about proposed interventions.&#8220;In the main, we have paid particular attention to challenges related to availability of clinicians attached to oncology services, supply chain management and procurement in general,&#8221; Mchunu said.-TNA Reporter
