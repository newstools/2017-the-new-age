In an unexpected turn of events yesterday afternoon, provincial Premier Ace Magashule reshuffled two heads of department in the sport, arts, culture and recreation and in the education provincial department.Advocate Tsoarelo Malakoane who was the head of sport, arts, culture and recreation for about four years, has been appointed head of education department while Stanley Malope, who previously served as the head of education department since 2010, will now take over as head of sport, arts, culture and recreation department.Explaining his move to reshuffle, Magashule said this was to strengthen service delivery so as to better serve the people of the province.He said the reshuffle, which was well considered, was done in terms of the Public Service Act.The heads of department, he said, were still hard workers and he hoped that their operations would continue to run as smoothly as before.Sandile Msibi who was appointed the head of the department of police, roads and transport in 2014, remains in his position.Magashule said Msibi he had been performing well and this was shown while he worked with MEC Butana Komphela, who has now been made health MEC. The government congratulates the heads of departments on their appointments as they will be facing a mammoth task. We wish them well and are confident that they will execute their functions with distinction, Magashule said.He said the changes were meant to strengthen the units and to ensure that better service delivery was achieved for the good of the people of the province. We are working very hard in the province and we will continue working hard in serving our people, Magashule said.In October, Magashule reshuffled his executive council at the same time when former MEC of Cogta Olly Mlamleli was deployed to serve the Mangaung metro municipality as a mayor.Magashule appointed Limakatso Mahasa as MEC for social development, replacing Sisi Ntombela who was moved to corporative governance and traditional affairs (Cogta).Mahasa was former chairperson of portfolio committee on governance, responsible for cooperative governance at Magashule s office and in the provincial legislature.The premier then moved the then MEC for police, roads and transport Butana Khompela to health, and former health MEC Dr Benny Malakoane took over the economic, tourism and environmental affairs while Sam Mashinini took over as police roads and transport.Magashule said he had widely and extensively consulted with different stakeholders from both within and outside of the province before making the changes, and trusted that the people of the province would benefit from them.BECKER SEMELAbeckers@thenewage.co.za
