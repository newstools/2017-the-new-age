Automobile Association (AA) has on Tuesday welcomed the new amendments regulation governing the learner transportation that no person will be allowed to transport children in the goods compartment.The move is in line with the National Road Traffic Act (NRTA). The introduction is a step in the right direction insofar as it puts the issue of scholar transport high on the road safety agenda.It also means those business operators who are taking children to school in vehicles which are either roadworthy or not designed for person transport (such as bakkies), will need to repair or replace their vehicles, AA said in a statement.Late last year the Kwazulu-Natal Road Traffic Inspectorate spokesperson Zinhle Mngomezulu had said that the transportation of children with bakkies was not safe.A bakkie is a goods compartment for the reason that is there is no seatbelt and no proper seats, Mngomezulu said.At the time transport department promised to come with an intervention regarding the learner transportation.The list included: a study to profile all schools using bakkies is currently under way, and will quantify the amount of intervention and resources required; engagements with the leadership of the public transport industry (taxis and buses) and bakkie operators are ongoing; a steering committee led by the SA National Taxi Council (Santaco) and the department to integrate pupil transport under Santaco structures is under way; enforcement operations targeting pupil transport; an ongoing campaign to promote pupil transport safety; and the Transport and Education departments are working to improve and expand the subsidised pupil transport programme.However, the Regulation also prohibits the transport of other persons in the goods compartment of vehicles for reward, unless they are enclosed in a canopy, and are not seated near any goods or tools. This regulation is aimed at improving the safety of passengers on the back of bakkies.Meanwhile, early this year transport department had announced that the new regulations would come into effect on May 1 but there was a concern that the new regulations did not go far enough.The department had added a provision aimed at protecting schoolchildren.Howard Dembovsky, chairman of the Justice Project SA, said there was a need for existing laws to be enforced effectively before amendments were made.&#8220;If you expect to adjust human behaviour by writing more laws instead of by enforcing the current laws, it&#8217;s not going to work [because] laws are only as good as their enforcement,&#8221; Dembovsky added.-Sipho Jack
