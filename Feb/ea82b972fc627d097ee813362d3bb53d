FOLLOWING the failed attempt to convince SuperSport United to release goalkeeper Mondli Mpoto for the 2017 U-20 Afcon preparations, coach Thabo Senong has called up Mamelodi Sundowns Khulekani Kubheka as the replacement. The tournament will take place later this month in Zambia with the top four teams qualifying for this year s U-20 Fifa World Cup hosted by South Korea in May.Senong has outlined his goal of taking the team to South Korea after the failure to do so two years ago. However, Senong s mission has already suffered a blow as some of the clubs opted against releasing their players for the continental showpiece. The South African U-20 men s team number one goalie, Mpoto, is one of the players Senong couldn t get to attend the first training camp last month.Other players include names such as Mpoto s teammate Khanyisa Mayo and Bidvest Wits star Phakamani Mahlambi and Zama Rambuwane who plays for Hapoel Raanana of Israel. Clubs are not forced to hand over players to the national team as the tournament falls out of the Fifa calendar dates.Rambuwane has been replaced by Ajax Cape Town s Masilakhe Phohlongo while Amajita s star striker will join the team later this week.sithembisod@thenewage.co.za-Sithembiso Dindi
