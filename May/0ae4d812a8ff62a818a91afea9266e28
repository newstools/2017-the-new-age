President Donald Trump on Tuesday fired FBI director James Comey, ousting the man heading a wide-ranging investigation into whether his aides colluded with Russia to sway last year&#8217;s US election.In a shock move that drew comparisons to the Watergate scandal that brought down Richard Nixon, Trump told Comey the FBI needed new leadership and he was being &#8220;terminated&#8221; with immediate effect.Under Comey&#8217;s leadership, the FBI concluded that President Vladimir Putin approved a wide-ranging campaign to tilt the vote in Trump&#8217;s favor.His snap dismissal, ostensibly for mishandling a probe into Hillary Clinton&#8217;s emails, sparked rare criticism from Republicans and allegations of a cover-up from seething Democrats who demanded an independent inquiry.The high-stakes gambit also raised immediate comparisons to the ill-fated firings that sped the collapse of Nixon&#8217;s presidency.Trump&#8217;s decision to fire the FBI director is virtually unprecedented, only one director has previously been fired in the bureau&#8217;s century-long history.In a letter circulated by the White House, Trump told Comey: &#8220;You are hereby terminated and removed from office, effective immediately.&#8221;&#8220;It is essential that we find new leadership for the FBI that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission.&#8221;&#8211; &#8216;Troubled&#8217; &#8211;Trump also used the letter to try to distance himself from the ever-deepening scandal over Russia&#8217;s involvement in the election.&#8220;I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation,&#8221; Trump wrote.The White House said the search for a new FBI director was to begin right away.FBI directors are appointed for a single 10-year term. The 56-year-old Comey, who is popular among rank-and-file agents, was appointed four years ago.The top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, said Trump had made a &#8220;big mistake.&#8221;&#8220;This does not seem a coincidence,&#8221; he said.Unless the administration appoints an independent special prosecutor to probe the Russian meddling, Schumer added, &#8220;every American will rightly suspect that the decision to fire director Comey was part of a cover-up.&#8221;Republicans, many of whom have fallen into line behind Trump after initial reluctance, also sought to distance themselves from the president.&#8220;I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Director Comey&#8217;s termination,&#8221; said Senator Richard Burr.Congressman Justin Amash, a fellow Republican, described parts of Trump&#8217;s letter to Comey as &#8220;bizarre&#8221; and announced &#8220;my staff and I are reviewing legislation to establish an independent commission on Russia.&#8221;Comey played an outsized &#8212; and controversial &#8212; role on the American political stage over the past year, lobbing one bombshell after another that rankled both parties in Washington.The stated reason for his dismissal &#8212; according to a memo from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein &#8212; was for mishandling the probe into Clinton&#8217;s emails, which the Democrat blames for trashing her chances of becoming president.Comey told lawmakers last week he felt &#8220;mildly nauseous&#8221; at the thought that he had swayed the election &#8212; but could not have acted any other way.&#8211; &#8216;Nothing less than Nixonian&#8217; &#8211;Since the start of Trump&#8217;s presidency, the FBI chief had increasingly appeared to be a thorn in the president&#8217;s side.He recently confirmed the agency was investigating Russian interference in last year&#8217;s presidential election and notably Moscow&#8217;s possible collusion with Trump&#8217;s campaign.Democrats &#8212; already angry that Congressional inquiries into Russian meddling have been hamstrung by Republicans&#8217; willingness to defend Trump &#8212; voiced sharp concerns that the FBI&#8217;s investigation may now be in jeopardy too, with several calling for an independent commission to take over the probe.&#8220;This is nothing less than Nixonian,&#8221; charged Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, who called Trump&#8217;s official justification for firing Comey &#8220;absurd.&#8221;&#8220;That fig leaf explanation seeks to cover the undeniable truth: The president has removed the sitting FBI director in the midst of one of the most critical national security investigations in the history of our country &#8212; one that implicates senior officials in the Trump campaign and administration,&#8221; he charged.When Trump initially decided to keep Comey &#8212; a Barack Obama appointee &#8212; in his job, it raised eyebrows from critics who saw it as a tacit reward for his role in damaging Clinton&#8217;s chances.But within months, the FBI chief was back in the national spotlight &#8212; this time taking aim at Trump.During testimony to Congress last month, Comey overtly challenged the president, flatly rejecting his explosive claim that he was wiretapped by his predecessor.And despite Trump&#8217;s dismissal of suggestions his team colluded with Moscow as &#8220;fake news,&#8221; it had become increasingly clear that Comey had set his sights on the issue of Russia&#8217;s election meddling, which has stalked Trump&#8217;s presidency from the start.-AFP
