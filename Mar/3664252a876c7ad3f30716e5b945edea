Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has given his assurance that the Department of Social Development and the Constitutional Court are at work to resolve the social grant contract debacle.The Deputy President was responding to questions by MPS in the National Assembly on Thursday.&#8220;The ministry has approached the court with a particular prayer and it is up to the Constitutional Court,&#8221; Ramaphosa said.&#8220;The highest court in our land is going to deliberate on this matter as they did in the past and they are going to make a ruling. Given the time frame that we have to the end of the month, I am absolutely certain the court is going to pull out all stops and deal with this matter with the level of urgency that it requires,&#8221; he said.However Ramaphosa refused to be drawn on questions about whether Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini should remain in her position.Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane asked Ramaphosa whether he would support the call for Dlamini to be axed.&#8220;This matter is being dealt with&#8230;members of the Executive are evaluated by the President who appoints them. It is the President only who can do so,&#8221; was Ramaphosa&#8217;s only response.The DA&#8217;s Chief Whip attempted to push Speaker Baleka Mbete to respond to Ramaphosa&#8217;s question, however she rebuffed his attempts.The Constitutional Court on Wednesday asked Minister Dlamini to answer as to what is happening at the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) with regards to the payment of social grants as from next month.Meanwhile Ramaphosa reported that the Polihali Dam and the Lesotho Highlands Water Project Phase II would be completed and delivering water to the country in 2025.Ramaphosa was responding to a question posed by Lulama Ntshayisa of the ANC, regarding numerous delays exprienced on the project.&#8220;The project will be delivered in line with the revised projections, with the delivery of water scheduled for the year 2025. Both governments have committed to the implementation of the project,&#8221; said Ramaphosa.The Deputy President added that he did not anticipate that the political turmoil unfolding in Lesotho would further delay the project.&#8220;The real challenge is that we are a water scarce country. We have not done so well in trapping our natural water resources. As for now, our water resources are being managed well but we can do better,&#8221; said Ramaphosa.-TNA Reporter
