THE Department of Arts and Culture has not committed to calls for Minister Nathi Mthethwa to grant award-winning actor and musician Joe Mafela a provincial funeral.Many of the actor s peers argue that Mafela who died following a car accident on Saturday night, is deserving of the honour.Speaking to The New Age, veteran actress and close friend Lillian Dube said Mafela was one of the few icons who deserved the accolade afforded to jazz singer Thandi Klaasen. The man was one of the best in the field. He needs to be sent off accordingly, Dube said.Since his death, the actor s home in Kew north of Johannesburg has seen mourners come and go as they offer their condolences to the family. At the time of going to print there was still no word on when veteran actor and comedian Mafela would be buried as the family was reported to be still holding a series of meetings to map a way forward. We will confirm the date of his funeral once the decision has been made, family spokesperson Millicent Mulalu said on Sunday.Television viewers will remember Mafela best for his portrayal as the lodger S dumo in Sgudi Snaysi (Is Good, Is Nice) on SABC. He became a household figure with his famous Chicken Licken television commercials which he conceptualised with it s popular jingle It s good, good, good, it s good, it s nice. The New Age could not get comment from Mthethwa or his communication team yesterday. Mafela s memorial service will be held at Braamfontein s Joburg Theatre on Thursday.SIYABONGA SITHOLE
