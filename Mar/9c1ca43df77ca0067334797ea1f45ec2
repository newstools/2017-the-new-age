President Jacob Zuma has on Friday elected not to suspend the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) head Adv. Shaun Abrahams.Calls for Abrahams to step down as head of the NPA followed his decision to withdraw fraud charges against Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan,Oupa Magashula and Ivan Pillay.The Presidency also announced on Friday that Abrahams as well as North Gauteng Director of Public Prosecutions Adv. Sibongile Mzinyathi and the Acting Head of the Priority Crimes Litigation Unit Dr Torie Pretorius would continue to occupy their positions.&#8220;It is the President s well considered view that there is no prima facie evidence pointing to the conduct of three prosecutors, constituting misconduct or lack of fitness and propriety to warrant the invocation of the provisions of section 12(6) read with 14(3) of the National Prosecuting Authority Act,&#8221; said Presidency spokesperson Bongani Ngqulunga.Last year Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane called on Zuma to suspend Abrahams with immediate effect and hold a parliamentary inquiry into his fitness to hold office.Zuma decided to give Abrahams 13 days to provide reasons why he should not be suspended pending an inquiry into his fitness to hold office.&#8220;Having considered the submissions received from the three prosecutors and concerns raised by the Helen Suzman Foundation and Freedom Under Law regarding their conduct in as far as it relates to the decision to charge and review the charges against Minister Pravin Gordhan, Mr Ivan Pillay and Mr Oupa Magushula, the President could not find substantiation for the claim that Adv. Abrahams, Adv Mzinyathi and Dr Pretorius s conducts were actuated by ulterior motive or any other improper motive which would give rise to a charge of misconduct or that they are no longer fit and proper to hold office,&#8221; said Ngqulunga-TNA Reporter
