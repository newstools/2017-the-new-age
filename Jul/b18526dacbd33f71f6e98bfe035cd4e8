At only 13 years old, Thabang Mphafi from Welkom has been chosen to represent his country in Ireland.He said the opportunity would enable him to live his dream and show the world what he was capable of. I was playing for my team, Dagbreek Primary School, when I was chosen as one of the players to represent our country in Ireland, Mphafi said. It is a great honour to me that will enable me to broaden my skills and expertise in rugby. This experience will cost R60000, which my grandparents who raised me don t have. I am pleading with sponsors and anyone who can help me to fulfil my dream to please assist me.He said he fell in love with rugby when he was only seven years old. I was in Grade 1 when I got the opportunity to play the game at my school. I fell in love with it right away. I joined the school s rugby team and when I was eight years old I was selected to play for the U-9 rugby team in the league. We won the league and I was chosen as the best player in the U-9A side. I felt proud because this showed me I had what it took to play against older boys, Mphafi said.This multi-talented youngster has represented the Free State in athletics, cricket and tennis but he insists that rugby is the love of his life. Rugby has opened so many doors for me. I was playing for Griffons Free State rugby team when representatives of King Edwards School saw me and offered me a full 100% bursary to study there. Next year I will be in Johannesburg where the institution is based to further my studies and my career. His aunt, Innocentia Mphafi, said the teenager had so much to offer. Thabang is very dedicated to rugby and he has so much potential. I m pleading with anyone who can help my nephew to fulfil his dreams to do so, Innocentia said.provinces@thenewage.co.za
