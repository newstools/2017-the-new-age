Howick police in KwaZulu-Natal have on Tuesday arrested two men who were in possession of stolen Eskom infrastructure.The utility said it was made aware of the incident by the police, the power utility then dispatched its investigation team to the police station to identify stolen goods. When we were made aware of the arrest by the Howick SAPS, the Eskom security investigations team proceeded to the SAPS storeroom where they identified and confirmed that the material found &#8211; 8m x 70mm low voltage power supply copper cable &#8211; in possession of the suspects was indeed Eskom s property, eskom said in a statement.The power utility further said it was experiencing similar theft in Merrivale area and nationally. Theft of copper cost the economy the region of R5 Billion to R7 Billion annually, adding that the utility spends an estimated R2 Billion replacing stolen copper cables. There is hope, however, that this crime will ultimately cease to exist, the courts have started to take copper theft seriously, said Tebogo Rakau, Divisional Executive for Security at Eskom.The most recent case of Andries Koos Mahlangu, who was recently sentenced to three years by the Kriel Magistrate Court, in Mpumalanga for cable theft, is evidence that South African courts have, indeed, started to take copper theft seriously.-TNA Reporter
