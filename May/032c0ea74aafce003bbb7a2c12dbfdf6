Overcrowding remains a problem in South Africa with an occupancy rate at some jails as high as 251% despite government efforts to reduce the numbers.The Department of Correctional Services says it has implemented several measures to help alleviate prison overcrowding.Department spokesperson Logan Maistry said the measures included relocating offenders from overcrowded to less crowded centres while effecting necessary and urgent infrastructural improvements and expansion to achieve more bed space.The department is responsible for 243 correctional centres across all nine provinces. At this time, our overcrowding rate nationally is at 37% and varies from facility to facility depending on a number of factors including the size and location of the centre, Maistry said.He said efforts to reduce overcrowding at the Pollsmoor Remand Detention Facility in the Western Cape continued to yield positive results. It has an occupancy rate at 148%, a milestone achieved for the first time since 2005, in keeping with the ruling by the Western Cape High Court in December 2016, he said.The court ruled in December that the number of inmates at Pollsmoor s Remand Detention Facility be reduced to 150% of its capacity within the next six months.The facility, built in 1975 to accommodate 1619 offenders, had an occupancy rate of 251% (4066) at the time of the ruling.Maistry said despite various challenges, the population has reduced from 4066 on December 6 to 2570 on May 8 and further reduced as at May 26. One thousand sentenced offenders were transferred to the Free State/Northern Cape region. While Pollsmoor is not an isolated problem, such conditions are certainly not prevalent at all 243 facilities. Other recommendations to deal with overcrowding include the option of building more incarceration facilities, marketing of bail and other non-custodial alternatives as well as ensuring an effective and efficient community corrections system, Maistry said.The department continues to implement strategies for the management of remand detainees which include referral of remand detainees to court for bail review and consideration of their length of detention before completing a period of two years initially and annually if the court decided that the remand detainee should continue with detention.Ironically, the ruling was not welcomed by all prisoners at Pollsmoor.The acting regional commissioner for correctional services, Freddie Engelbrecht, said some prisoners were upset because they were being moved further away from their families. Often relatives cannot afford the increased travel costs involved when prisoners are relocated to less overcrowded centres.NONDUMISO ZWANEnondumisoz@thenewage.co.za
