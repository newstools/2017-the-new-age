The Chamber of Mines failed to lodge papers with the high court yesterday over the mining charter.The industry body was expected to file court papers but Memory Johnstone, spokesperson for the chamber, told The New Age that the papers were not yet available.The chamber said it was not properly consulted on the new charter, despite representing at least 90% of the mines by value.The charter stipulates that local mines should be at least 30% owned by black people, up from the previous requirement of 26%, which the industry insists was not achievable. Where is the truth? The mining minister said he consulted 60 stakeholders on the process, independent mining analyst Mmamokgethi Molopyane said yesterday.She warned that the saga will hurt mineworkers. The impact will always be on the ordinary mineworker. No matter the decision of the court, the whole thing could lead to huge retrenchments, Mmamokgethi warned.Plans to force mining companies to give the black majority a bigger stake faces another major obstacle of convincing banks to back billions of dollars of fresh deals in an industry in decline.Bloomberg News reported yesterday that banks would balk at funding BEE mining charter deals because growth at mines is expected to slump. The charter will affect on our ability to finance the mining industry, said Ursula Nobrega at Investec, one of South Africa s big five banks. We already exercise caution as to who and what projects we finance. The Chamber of Mines said it will challenge the new rules in court, while Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa called for the charter to be reconsidered and the ruling ANC said the legislation may cause job losses.With mining companies using diminishing cash flows to finance empowerment deals, there could be fewer bankable transactions , Sandile Mbulawa, head of resource finance for Rand Merchant Bank, told Bloomberg yesterday.bernards@thenewage.co.za
