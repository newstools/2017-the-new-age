Bafana Bafana stand-in Coach Owen da Gama said they went into their international friendly match against Angola on Tuesday, aching for a win.&#8220;We wanted a win badly, especially for the local supporters who were supportive from the minute we landed in East London. But it was not to be,&#8221; he said. Bafana Bafana played to a 0-0 draw against Angola after battering Guinea-Bissau 3-1 in Durban.However the Coach is confident that both the clashes were rewarding to the team. &#8220;I believe it was a very worthwhile exercise for us. The two opponents (Guinea-Bissau and Angola) have typical Portuguese influence, which Cape Verde also has off the ball running, very quick, and technically very strong players but not physically overpowering,&#8221; da Gama said.The coach adds that this exercise gave them an idea of what to expect when they face Cape Verde.Da Gama brought in an almost complete squad while playing against Angola in their second friendly match. He made nine changes to the squad that played Guinea-Bissau.&#8220;It was a game where we really wanted to see how much depth we have. We tried to keep some form of a structure with Mathoho, Langerman and Rivaldo as well as Jali and Mabunda, just to have a good spine,&#8221; Da Gama said.Da Gama brought in a new young crop of players into the squad, Mahlambi and Singh from the u20 team to give them an experience of the senior team. The coach wanted to give all selected players a chance to play during the friendlies but did not manage to. Goalkeeper Shu-Aib Walters, Lorenzo Gordinho and Lars Veldwijk are the only ones who did not get game time during the two matches.Bafana Bafana were using the matches as a preparation for their upcoming 2018 Fifa World Cup qualifiers which they will play against the Cape Verde later on in the year.-TNA Reporter
