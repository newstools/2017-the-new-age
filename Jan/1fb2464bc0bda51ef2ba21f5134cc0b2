US car maker Ford will recall the 4556 1.6 litre Ford Kugas sold in SA following multiple cases of vehicles catching fire, the company said yesterday.Ford has come under criticism for its slow response to the crisis in which at least one person has died. At least 47 Kugas have burst into flames on South African roads.In a joint press briefing with the National Consumer Commission, Ford announced plans to take safety measures to restore the cars.Ford executives at the briefing failed to address issues related to compensation for the recalled vehicles.Ford SA president and CEO Jeff Nemith said those affected had to communicate with their insurance companies.The safety recall is limited to 1.6 litre Kugas manufactured between December 2012 to February 2014. The 1.5 litre and 2 litre models were not affected.Nemith said the cause of the fires was overheating, leading to a crack in the engine head that causes oil to catch fire.Reshall Jimmy, 33, died in 2015 when his Kuga caught fire in Wilderness, in the Western Cape.Family members of Jimmy who were at yesterday s briefing told The New Age Ford refused to acknowledge liability for the death of Jimmy and videos showed that Jimmy was trapped in the car and burnt alive.They said there was evidence an electrical fault had caused the fire.Renisha and Kaveen Jimmy, siblings of the late Reshall Jimmy, will be holding a media briefing today to respond to Ford. They say they have documented all 47 incidents of these vehicles catching fire since his death and have also been coordinating with the National Consumer Commission and legal representatives about the matter.Commissioner Ebrahim Mohammed said that no brand was bigger than the law. It is regrettable that a life has been lost and that consumers had been exposed to a hazard that they never would have expected, Mohammed said.Nemith said the particular issue found in SA could be linked to an increase in temperatures.The National Consumer Comission, when questioned on their delayed response to the issue, said they were not aware of the incidents until they saw media reports.The organisation claimed it did not receive any complaints about the Kuga until December, after which they acted promptly.Consumers have been advised to take their cars to the nearest dealerships so that safety recall measures could be implemented.THELMA NGOMAthelman@thenewage.co.za
