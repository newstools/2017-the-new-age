For the next three years, residents of eThekwini municipality will benefit from a budget allocation of more than R1bn to buy new replacement buses for the city s Integrated Rapid Public Transport Network.This was revealed in a report that was tabled at a special executive committee meeting last month. The report shows the municipality s plan to send out to tender for a bus fleet as part of the replacement programme for the ageingDurban transport buses and for new buses for the first corridor (C3) of the Go! Durban service, which is the route between Pinetown and Bridge City in KwaMashu. The municipality proposes to replace 150 buses over the next three years on an approved budget of R325m.Presently there are 531 buses operating in the city.The report said this was to ensure that the ageing Durban transport fleet was replaced and maintained to ensure that the operation was not compromised. The optimum life span of a bus is 10 years and going beyond this will result in significant repairs and maintenance required, the report said. Also, the municipality will not be able to achieve a good residual value if these buses exceed a 10-year lifespan.Older buses require major repair work which includes engine, gearbox and differential, with major downtimes which impact on the bus availability and compromises service delivery. There are currently 128 buses that have exceeded their optimum lifespan and require major service which include engine, gearbox and some body work.For the Go!Durban C3 service, the report shows that more than R764m has been approved for the fleet requirement of 190 new buses over the next three years.It said the buses would be funded via the Public Transport Network Grant (PTNG) from savings in the current financial year and in the form of a loan for which the loan repayments would be funded by the PTNG.The project is under way with infrastructure for the first corridor nearing completion.The eThekwini Transport Authority has planned to start with an interim operation by mid-year which will require about 30 buses.The report said the benefit of a newer fleet was that the maintenance to operate them was more cost effective at a per kilometre rate as compared to older buses. The newer fleet will comply with EURO4 and upward specifications which minimise carbon emissions. These buses also have a lower fuel consumption which will result in significant savings in fuel, the municipality said.The report also outlined the costs of purchasing the new buses for the project and the replacement fleet over the next three years.It showed that the total cost for the replacement bus programme was R1.1bn for three financial years.Lesley Tshamanoprovinces@thenewage.co.za
