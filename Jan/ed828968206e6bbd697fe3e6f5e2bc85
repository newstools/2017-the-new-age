More than 3 000 pupils who come from child-headed homes fared well in their matric results due to the Social Development Department s Isibindi programme which focuses on child headed homes.This was revealed by Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini in Pretoria yesterday.Dlamini said the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) distributed more than 11 million social grants to the poor across the country and some 2016 matriculants were part of this. The department has put in place measures that look after our child- and youth-headed homes. One of the most successful programmes is Isibindi, a programme which deploys child and youth care workers in communities to assist children, she said.Dlamini said the programme has a special focus on Grade 12 pupils and in 2016, 3 400 matriculants were part of the programme. The assistance by the programme ensures that our children remain in school. The child and youth care workers support these children and make sure that they are relieved of household responsibilities which include being parents to their siblings while trying to pass Grade 12, she said.She said that the programme had 300 sites across the country which supported 200000 children and youths.More than 600000 pupils registered to write the 2016 matric exams and 188 758 of these were social grants beneficiaries. Of the 188 758 beneficiaries, 95% wrote their exams and less than 10000 grant recipients dropped out of school before sitting for their final examinations. We commit to investigate reasons for this dropout, Dlamini said.She revealed that of the grant beneficiaries that passed, 41% managed to get bachelors passes.BATANDWA MALINGObatandwam@thenewage.co.za
