George North returned after injury to the Wales team announced Wednesday for Saturday&#8217;s Six Nations international away to Scotland.North replaced Alex Cuthbert, heavily criticised for his role in Wales&#8217;s 21-16 defeat by defending champions England in Cardiff earlier this month, in what was the only change to the starting side.There was less than an hour before kick-off at the Principality Stadium when Northampton powerhouse wing North failed a fitness test on a leg injury and was replaced by Cuthbert.England came from behind to win when, with just four minutes left, Elliot Daly scored a dramatic try in the corner after opposing wing Cuthbert missed a tackle.Coach Rob Howley&#8217;s decision to select Cardiff flyer Cuthbert, now no longer even in the matchday 23 for this weekend&#8217;s visit to Murrayfield, against England was slammed as a &#8220;blind hope&#8221; call by former Wales wing Shane Williams.Meanwhile Howley resisted the temptation to restore Taulupe Faletau, who came off the bench against England, to the starting side.He instead retained a back-row of Ross Moriarty, Justin Tipuric and Sam Warburton.The experienced Faletau was again among the replacements, with fit-again lock Luke Charteris back on the bench.Scotland, beaten 22-16 by France last time out, are due to name their side on Thursday.&#8221;We have been able to select from a position of strength which is a huge positive and it is good to welcome George (North) back into the starting XV and Luke (Charteris) on to the bench, said Howley in a Welsh Rugby Union statement.&#8220;In terms of intensity and performance, we stepped up a level against England and we need to take the positives from that performance and take it into 80 minutes against Scotland at Murrayfield,&#8221; explained Howley, in charge while regular Wales coach Warren Gatland is seconded to the British and Irish Lions ahead of their tour of New Zealand later this year.&#8220;We know what we are capable of and we want to deliver that on Saturday alongside the result, which international rugby is all about,&#8221; the former Wales and Lions scrum-half added.Both Wales and Scotland have one win from two matches in this season&#8217;s Six Nations, with the Welsh beating Italy 33-7 in Rome first time up and the Scots launching their campaign with a 27-22 win at home to Ireland.Wales team to play Scotland in a Six Nations international at Murrayfield on Saturday (1425 GMT kick-off):Wales (15-1)Leigh Halfpenny; George North, Jonathan Davies, Scott Williams, Liam Williams; Dan Biggar, Rhys Webb; Ross Moriarty, Justin Tipuric, Sam Warburton; Alun Wyn Jones (capt), Jake Ball; Tomas Francis, Ken Owens, Rob EvansReplacements: Scott Baldwin, Nicky Smith, Samson Lee, Luke Charteris, Taulupe Faletau, Gareth Davies, Sam Davies, Jamie Roberts .-AFP &nbsp;
