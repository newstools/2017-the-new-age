Lack of supervision and commitment by management and poor workmanship were some of the biggest causes of incidents that lead to injuries and fatalities in the construction industry, a forensic investigator has said.While Lennie Samuel, a senior inspector and forensic investigator at the Department of Labour, did not cite any particular example the roof collapse at Charlotte Maxeke Academic Academic Hospital is one such high profile accident under investigation. The collapse injured five and led to wide-spread criticism about the state of the hospital.Last year two died and 17 were injured when a temporary bridge near Grayston drive collapsed onto the M1 highway. This too is the subject of a forensic investigation.Delivering his presentation on Collective Responsibility for Construction Health and Safety, Samuel urged delegates, especially employers and managers in the construction sector, to comply with health and safety regulations in order to save lives. The lack of supervision and failures by management, in my view, is the biggest factor to the cause of incidents. Most of the incidents investigated find its root cause in the upper streams of management. The majority of our investigations reveal there is lack of management controls and lack of supervision.They (management) identify and correct only the immediate causes or symptoms and not the root causes. The consequences, unfortunately, often lead to disablement, disfigurement, injury and fatalities and collapses, a concerned Samuel said. When you (employers) start to comply with health and safety legislations, you will save workers lives. The health and safety legislation is not a problem; it is the behaviour, attitude and perception of certain employers that is the problem because some employers say they have been doing things in a certain way and nothing has happened, said Samuel.Samuel acknowledged that while the construction sector contributed 12% to the country s gross domestic product (GDP) in the previous financial year, the sector had at least 1.5 to 2.5 fatalities per week.He revealed that in the previous financial year, there was an average of 12 500 construction sites in the country and the sector employed at least 1.4 million people as of June 2016.He said that while the health and safety regulations in the country were of high standards, they had not had the desired effect, as fatalities and injuries continue in the construction sector.Samuel stressed that fatalities and injuries in the sector could be stopped if all the stakeholders worked together but it starts with employers complying &#8211; TNA REPORTER
