Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Monday denounced a &#8220;hate campaign&#8221; aimed at Donald Trump, saying the US president-elect&#8217;s administration would not be &#8220;worse&#8221; than Barack Obama&#8217;s.&#8220;Big international media have speculated a lot,&#8221; he told reporters. &#8220;We are surprised by the hate campaign against Donald Trump &#8212; brutal &#8212; in the whole world, in the western world, in the United States.&#8221;The socialist president said he will wait until Trump takes over the White House on Friday before making judgments on the incoming US president&#8217;s foreign policy.&#8220;I want to be cautious,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He won&#8217;t be worse than Obama, that&#8217;s the only thing I would venture to say.&#8221;Maduro said he foresaw &#8220;major changes in global geopolitics&#8221; and expressed his desire &#8220;to have relations of respect, communication and cooperation.&#8221;Venezuela is plagued with soaring crime, runaway inflation and a sharply contracting economy, worsened by falling oil prices.The opposition blames Maduro&#8217;s economic policies and mismanagement for the crisis. He contends it is the product of a US-backed capitalist conspiracy.During the 2016 US election the Venezuelan government voiced anger over parallels drawn between Trump and the late former Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez.The US has had a strained relationship with the Latin American country since Chavez &#8212; famous for his anti-American rhetoric &#8212; took over as its president in 1999.-AFP
