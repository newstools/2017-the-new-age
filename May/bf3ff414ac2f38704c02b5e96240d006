They may have played some of the best football this season and pushed Bidvest Wits in the race for the MTN 8 and PSL titles, but Mamelodi Sundowns have finished the season empty handed.This is the first time in three seasons that Sundowns, the continental champions and Super Cup winners, finish the domestic season without silverware. Sundowns good run in this year s Champions League season has given their fans something to cheer and coach Pitso Mosimane is happy that his side has qualified for the CAF Champions League for a fourth successive season.When Mosimane took over a few years ago, Downs had not won anything in more than seven years. His arrival saw a big change in fortunes, as they won the league in the following season and followed it up with success in the Nedbank Cup, Telkom Knockout and another league title. This is why the African coach of the year feels his side have done well despite not wining trophies. I have to congratulate the boys for putting their bodies on the line. They did exceptionally well. The Sundowns fans as well have been behind us. To cope with so many games in one season is great for us. Especially since we did not have a pre-season. We may have lost to Wits in the MTN 8 and league, but we won the grand slams, Mosimane said. We won the Champions League and the Super Cup. We were running our own race. We cannot be greedy and not cherish what the boys have done. The Brazilians host Tunisian side Esperance in the Champions League on Friday.-MMASEKEPE MATSEBANE|mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
