To commemorate World Competition Day, the Competition Commission will join a coalition of competition authorities and civil society organisations around the world today. World Competition Day emphasis the possible benefits from the implemented competition regime and urges consumers to play a role in making competition regimes work worldwide. On this day in 1980, the United Nations Conference approved the Set of Multilaterally Agreed Equitable Principles and Rules for Control of Restrictive Business Practices. A recent World Bank study on competition policy in South Africa has reportedly shown that by tackling four cartels in wheat, maize, poultry and pharmaceuticals, the reduction in prices is estimated to have reduced overall poverty by at least 0.40%. The lower prices that followed the action made by South African competition authorities against these four cartels, has lifted about 202,000 individuals above the poverty line. In June 2016 a network of 35 African regional and national competition authorities, together with the World Bank, released a report which showed that the retail prices of 10 key consumer goods on average 24% higher in African cities than in other economies around the world. -Tna Reporter
