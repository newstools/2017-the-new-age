Three former England captains united on Saturday to condemn the one-match ban given to South African paceman Kagiso Rabada.He will miss the second test starting on Friday after receiving a fourth demerit point in 24 months for what the International Cricket Council called &#8220;inappropriate language&#8221; towards batsman Ben Stokes in the first test at Lord&#8217;s on Friday.The three previous points were all for &#8220;deliberate physical contact&#8221; against Sri Lanka&#8217;s Niroshan Dickwella in February.&#8220;It seems a nonsense to me that those two things combined have resulted in a test match ban,&#8221; Michael Atherton told Sky Sports viewers after watching film of both incidents.&#8220;Three demerit points for that slight bit of contact with Dickwella and then yesterday when it&#8217;s hardly directed at Ben Stokes.&#8221;&#8220;For me it&#8217;s ridiculous,&#8221; said one of Atherton&#8217;s predecessors Ian Botham.&#8220;It&#8217;s a physical game and you&#8217;re talking about heat-of-the-moment exchanges. That&#8217;s just a nudge.&#8221;A third former captain, David Gower, agreed.&#8220;It&#8217;s highlighted by the fact that those points from a previous offence mean he&#8217;s not going to be playing in the next test match of the series. It is a very, very harsh punishment.&#8221;South Africa are already missing paceman Dale Steyn for the whole series with a shoulder injury and on Saturday fellow seamer Vernon Philander was taken to hospital for an x-ray after being hit on the hand during his innings of 52. The x-ray showed no bones were broken.He was last man out as South Africa were dismissed for 361, 97 behind on first innings.-Reuters
