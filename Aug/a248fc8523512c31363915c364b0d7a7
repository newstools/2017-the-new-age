A motion of no confidence in the head of state is an important matter.This point was made clear by chief justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, who went further to say: Good governance and public interest could at times haemorrhage quite profusely if that motion were to be left lingering on for a considerable period of time. The point was equally made by the speaker of Parliament, who said a vote of no confidence is a potent tool towards holding the president to account, connected to the values of accountability and responsiveness to the needs of the people.The motion, therefore, deserved to be made a priority within a reasonable time. It is in this light that the speaker moved swiftly to set a date for the motion in order to arrest whatever effects a lingering perception on this vote could have.The only delay was on deciding the operation of such a motion, which required a proper and rational method that would weigh in prevailing material conditions and law.The speaker, of course, was ultimate of the view that the prevailing material conditions would require the vote of no confidence be conducted by secret ballot.The reality the speaker needed to consider was, as stated by the chief justice, that anybody, including MPs or of the judiciary anywhere in the world, could potentially be bought when their voting in such a consequential motion was held in secret. When that happens in a motion of no confidence, the outcome could betray the people s best interests. This possibility must not be lightly or naively taken out of the equation as a necessarily far removed and negligible possibility when the stakes are too high. Crass dishonesty, in the form of bribetaking or other illegitimate methods of gaining undeserved majorities, must not be discounted from the speaker s decision-making process. The speaker had to ensure then that the correct exercise of Parliament s powers in relation to a motion of no confidence in the president, must therefore have the effect of ensuring the voting process is not a fear or money-inspired sham but a genuine motion for the effective enforcement of accountability .Although the people who voted for their party MPs are entitled to know, because of the principle of openness, how their MPs are conducting themselves inside Parliament, including how they are voting, in the atmosphere of fear and intimidation, the speaker decided that in this particular instance it would be prudent to conduct the motion through a secret ballot.Which is exactly what the speaker did and this was seen as a victory by opposition parties who, for some reason, did not register that MPs used their own reasons and their own fears to arrive at deciding on the motion.Conducting the motion in secret could well eliminate the fear of retribution but it does not eliminate the members ability to reason.The question, therefore, is that after fear of retribution was eliminated through a secret ballot, why ANC MPs continued to vote to support their president, thereby securing the failure of the motion.Here are the facts.Irrespective of who brought the motion an All MPs know, as reminded by the courts that a no confidence vote is a crucial accountabilityenhancing instrument that forever reminds the president and the Cabinet of the worst repercussions that could be faced, for a perceived or actual mismanagement of the people s best interests.They all know that a no confidence vote, as stated by the chief justice, constitutes one of the severest political consequences imaginable a sword that hangs over the head of the president to force him or her to always do the right thing.Equally, intelligent MPs know that a no confidence motion, unlike impeachment, does not necessarily require any serious wrongdoing, though this is implied.And the Constitution does not say when or on what grounds it would be fitting to seek refuge in a motion of no confidence. So unlike impeachment, which requires serious wrongdoing, such as a conviction through a court of law, there is constitutionally no grounds overtly stated for a vote of no confidence motion to be tabled.That is why speaker after speaker of the opposition was all over the place because each had a reason why they had lost confidence in the president.The opposition parties, therefore, spent no time putting together an argument to those MPs they were courting to vote with them but relied on simply dealing with fear of retribution as if this would answer a multitude of questions.This was their biggest failure but it also underestimated events of the last eight years of the Zuma presidency.Those leaders who were elected in 2009, the same time Zuma was elected, such as Nicolas Sakorzy of France, never made it to their second terms, mainly because they could not jump-start their economies after the economic crash of 2008. Even Barack Obama battled to get elected for a second term in 2012, it was the economy, stupid!Most of the complaints about Zuma are about the economy, the downgrades, the recession, the unemployment and of course the link of all of these to the claimed lapses in judgment and decision making.There are obviously 200 MPs who don t think all these are linked to the president s decision making. Our export market is 50% commodities and with the slowing down of China, the demand for our commodities is down, which affects mining, jobs and the rand since mining makes us heavily exposed to the export market.Given the SA 40 Index, 70% of its income and trade comes from its top 10, which has more mining companies, like Anglo and BHP, some think this is more of a problem that reshuffling Pravin Gordhan, who even when he was a finance minister did not really have great ideas of how to grow the economy.Our local market has diversified but our export market needs serious diversification.Secondly, other MPs of course are convinced that to engage with the powers that consolidate the status quo half-heatedly is to concede defeat before one has begun and Zuma has engaged with the stronghold that WMC has on the economy in ways that no other president has done before and again these became part of real consideration by MPs whether to vote for the motion or not.Since the risk of retribution was eliminated, what was left was analysis on the perceived link between Zuma s decisions and the economy.The real matter is that, unlike an impeachment which requires serious wrongdoing, a no confidence motion requires persuasion and a factual convincing of other members and not just a secret ballot.On putting a convincing pitch both to MPs and on the floor of the National Assembly on why Zuma must go, opposition MPs clearly failed.Yonela Diko is a media consultant
