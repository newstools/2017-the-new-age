The compilation of an effective and reliable immovable asset register has enabled the Department of Public Works to better keep control over its stock of 92593 properties.This was announced in a written reply by Public Works Minister Thulas Nxesi in answer to a Parliamentary question from DA MP Andricus van der Westhuizen.Managing the government s property portfolio, he said, included the verification, location, high-level condition assessments and identification of significant components and users of the properties. Taking into consideration the extensive nature of the public works portfolio, this was an almost impossible task in the past, Nxesi said.He said now the department was for the first time able to make informed and calculated investment decisions in line with our goal of optimising our property portfolio .In another response to Van der Westhuizen, Nxesi said the department had budgeted an amount of R3.5m in terms of prestige logistical services for the 2017 state of the nation address and opening of Parliament event. Only R2.7m of this amount was spent, thus saving about R800 000.Transport Minister Dipuo Peters, in response to another DA question, said the national Treasury would determine the amount of the proposed carbon tax.She said: Domestic airlines will determine how to filter the amount to the passengers. It is not possible to determine at this point how much a domestic air ticket price will be increased as a result of the proposed carbon tax. On taxes levied on flight tickets, she said the Airports Company South Africa (Acsa) determined the airport charges in the form of passenger service charges that airlines collected through air tickets. Income from these taxes were used in the provision of passenger facilitation and infrastructure services at Acsa s airports.The Department of Transport did not get an allocation from the total annual income, but in the 2016 financial year Acsa garnered R3.1bn, of which R1.5bn was from domestic flights and R1.6bn from international travellers.DENNIS CRUYWAGENnews@thenewage.co.za
