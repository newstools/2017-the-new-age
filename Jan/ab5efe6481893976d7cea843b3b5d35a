Firefighters in Clarens have started an initiative to assist poor communities around them by donating vegetables, which they plant themselves.Clarens might be the province s most popular tourist attraction but townships surrounding it, one of them Kgubetswana township, is poverty stricken.Working on Fire (WoF) Clarens team leader Sipho Mofokeng said the aim of the initiative was to donate fresh vegetables to the community, grown in a garden on their base which was started by their team to combat hunger in the communities. In the garden the team grows different vegetables seasonally such as cabbage, spinach, green beans, green peppers, carrots and tomatoes, Mofokeng said.He said at first they shared the vegetables among themselves but they realised it was their duty to assist the communities surrounding them. They then started to donate the vegetables. Our base manager supplies us with seeds and from there on we produce our own fertiliser and mix cow dung with it in order to make our soil produce year in and year out, Mofokeng said.He said although the team faced numerous challenges in growing these vegetables such as theft, stray cows grazing in their garden and the lack of rain recently experienced across the country, the team had preserved and continued to supply the community and to the NPO that they had adopted.WoF spokesperson Wayne Mokhethi said they welcomed and supported what their employees were doing to support the needy.He said they were not only fighting fires but also fighting poverty and raising awareness on how to prevent fires in schools and in their respective areas. Some of our firefighters were sent to Cape Town to assist in fighting the veld fire that destroyed many hectors, Mokhethi said adding they were working hard also to assist other areas. Clarens is just a stones throw away from the Golden Gate National Park.It boasts numerous museums and art galleries and fine restaurants for tourists to go and dine at but on the other side of the town, lays a stark contrast from what visitors see when visiting the rural town in the eastern side of the province.provinces@thenewage.co.za&nbsp;
