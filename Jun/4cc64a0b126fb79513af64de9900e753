In a gruesome discovery, another lifeless body of a five-year-old child was found by the Strand residents in Cape Town at the weekend.Ironically, with her eyes gouged out, the dead body of Minentle Lekhakha was found on the last day of Child Protection Week.The Grade R pupil at ACJ Phakade Primary School in Nomzamo, went missing on Saturday .Minentle s body was found three days after police arrested a 56-year-old man in connection with the discovery of what was believed to be human remains of a female among reeds in an open field at TR-Section, Khayelitsha, last week.In an interview with Cape Times, her grand-mother Thelma Bomela said: She went missing on Saturday at around 2pm . When I came back from work she would normally wait for me because she knew I would bring something for her from work,&#8221; Bomela said. So I arrived from work, and waited for her to come to me as she would normally do. But she did not. I asked other children about her whereabouts, but no one seemed to know where she was,&#8221; she said.Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said no arrest had been made and postmortem would be conducted to determine the cause of death.The killing of Lekhakha came few weeks after the murder of the three-year-old Courtney Pieters. Pieters body was found in a shallow grave three weeks ago at the Epping Industrial centre after she went missing from her Elsies River s home.TNA Reporter
