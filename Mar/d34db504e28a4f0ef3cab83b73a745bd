Finance, economy and enterprise development MEC Wendy Nelson said the provincial government is committed to collapse the apartheid legacy by investing in programmes that accelerate radical economic transformation.Nelson said this when she tabled her R39.1bn North West budget for the 2017-18 financial year.The budget comprises R30bn from the national equitable share, R7bn from conditional grants and R1.5bn from revenue generated in the province.The MEC said her budget was a fitting tribute to the values and aspirations of former ANC president and struggle icon Oliver Reginald Tambo.She said Tambo stood for economic emancipation of the masses and that the government would not be swayed in its resolve to ensure that villages, townships and small dorpies (VTSD) precincts benefited from state spending on procurable goods and services. The life and legacy of Oliver Reginald Tambo, who selflessly fought for the liberation of our country, remains an inspiration to the people of Bokone Bophirima as we forge ahead with the implementation of radical economic transformation programmes anchored on the five concretes, pursuant to the attainment of the National Development Plan objectives, she said. Since the assumption of office by the fifth administration, led by our fearless Premier Mahumapelo, funding has been redirected to programmes that seek to dismantle the apartheid legacy of poverty, inequality and unemployment which mainly affect Africans, in particular those who live in VTSD areas. As the province, we agree with President Jacob Zuma that radical socio economic transformation represents a fundamental change in the structure, systems, institutions and patterns of ownership, management and control of the economy in favour of all South Africans, especially the poor, the majority of whom are African and female, as defined by the governing party which makes policy for our democratic government, she said.On the economic outlook, MEC Nelson said the previous year was challenging for the province as it had been hard hit by one of the severest droughts in history, forcing the government to come up with temporary relief measures in the form of the erection of irrigation systems, drilling of boreholes, water tankering and the provision of fodder to more than 21000 farmers.The population increased from 2.9 million in 1996 to reach 3.7 million in 2016 and unemployment and poverty still remain the biggest challenge.The majority of the 1.6 million people classified as poor in the province live in abject poverty.This is the situation despite 1% economic growth in 2016 and an increase in employment in the provincial public sector.ELFAS TORERAIelfast@thenewage.co.za
