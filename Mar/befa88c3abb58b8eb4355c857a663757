Fees Must Fall activist Bonginkosi Khanyile said that he knew that the government was brutal but never thought that it was this brutal.Khanyile told reporters outside the Westville Prison in Durban on Thursday after his release. We were fighting for education, now the black government is fighting us and its very sad. I knew that the government was brutal but I never thought that it was this brutal,&#8221; Khanyile said.Khanyile stated that the struggle still continues because there is nothing that they have achieved as students. The only thing that we achieved is the missing-middle. Our demand was free education and decolonised education because we know that government can afford free education, said Khanyile.#FeesMustFall activist receives hero&#8217;s welcome outside DUT Steve Biko Campus @ANN7tv @The_New_Age @SNNreporter pic.twitter.com/runi0rTQ6h SibongiseniMaphumulo (@SiboMaphumulo) March 2, 2017#BonginkosiKhanyile rallying students at #DUT @The_New_Age @ANN7tv @SNNreporter pic.twitter.com/GVWHQtqXfA SibongiseniMaphumulo (@SiboMaphumulo) March 2, 2017#BonginkosiKhanyile waiting to address students at DUT Steve Biko Campus @ANN7tv @The_New_Age @SNNreporter pic.twitter.com/ikzhBvYseR SibongiseniMaphumulo (@SiboMaphumulo) March 2, 2017The final year public administration student was released on R250 bail after the state did an about turn in the Constitutional Court on Wednesday and said it was no longer opposing his bail application.Described as a brilliant student who excelled in all his modules, Khanyile was first arrested with 28 other students during the FeesMustFall protests, at the Durban University of Technology early last year.He was granted bail with conditions but was arrested again in September when protests resumed.He has not been able to get bail since then and night vigils, solidarity meetings and protest marches had been held to support the call for his release .The charges Khanyile faced for his first arrest included convening or gathering without notice, convening or attending an illegal gathering or demonstration, interference with police duties in an illegal gathering and trespassing.On February 5 last year, he was released on warning to abide by certain conditions, but he was arrested again in a protest on September 27.Two applications in the Durban Magistrate s Court for bail were refused as was an appeal to the high court in Pietermaritzburg.Chief justice Mogoeng Mogoeng was praised for asking hard questions which left the state with no explanation as to why they were keeping Khanyile behind bars. He asked why he was not granted bail. Why is Mr Khanyile in jail? What are the key factors that inform the refusal of bail? Mogoeng said.State advocate Andy Bester failed to answer.-TNA Reporter
