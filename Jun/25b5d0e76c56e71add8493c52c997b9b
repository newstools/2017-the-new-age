Defending African champions Mamelodi Sundowns will be looking to return to the top of the crop in the group C slot when they lock horns with the Tunisian giants, Esp rance, tonight at the Stade Olympia Stadium.Sundowns suffered a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Esp rance at the Lucas Moripe Stadium three weeks ago after they were awarded a late penalty. However, the Brazilians are determined to reclaim their top spot.Sundowns captain Hlompho Kekana acknowledged that his side was no longer an underdog in this tournament. We are no longer underdogs, but rather the team to beat. It is normal for defending champions to be put under pressure. What remains is for us is to be humble in our approach, and to make sure we win our games, Kekana said.Pitso Mosimane s side will be looking for nothing but a win to improve their chances of proceeding to the next round of the competition. We prepared well. It is clear all the players want to win. It is very important for us to win so that we are in a good space. We will go to the stadium to play our own game, and hopefully win, added Kekana.Sundowns&#8217; chances have been boosted by the return of their winger Anthony Laffor who missed the clash against Esp rance due to injury. I am happy to be back and fit. I am ready to play. I have achieved a great deal with Sundowns, but there is still much to achieve. I am still not satisfied with my achievements so far,&#8221; Laffor said.Laffor believes that his side will beat Esp rance only if they can convert the chances. They are technically well structured, but we are confident that we can break them and their defence. This was clear from the number of chances we had, so we hope that on Wednesday we will use the opportunities, he said.
