Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille has today announced that the city would implement a 4B water restriction, reflecting the seriousness of the water shortage facing the city.The restrictions are expected to last for 60 days.&#8220;We are in a critical situation. To build resilience to acute water shortages we need to push even harder and reduce water usage to 500 million litres of water a day,&#8221; De Lille saidShe added: I request every Capetonian to push harder than ever before. But as the council we will not meet until the end of July and so I am requesting the council to support further restrictions, she said.The city has been declared a water disaster area following the shortage of rainfall in the city.&#8220;We must consider how long we are going to shower each day, how many times we are going to flush the toilet, and the amount of water we will use for cooking and cleaning,&#8221; De Lille said.The mayor resolved that a Water Resilience Task team be established under the leadership of the chief resilience officer. We will do everything possible to ensure we have enough water available, and that it should not drop below the 500ml a day, she said.The implications of the restrictions mean that that each person should not use more than 100 litres water a day, she said.&#8220;I would also like to ask the council to support the establishment of a Water Resilience advisory committee to give advice to the Water Resilience task team, De Lille said.Meanwhile, the Nelson Mandela Bay has also been declared a water disaster area. This was after the city had experienced lack of rain and low dam levels.TNA Reporter
