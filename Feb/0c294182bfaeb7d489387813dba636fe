Stoke City striker Peter Crouch dismissed talks of retirement and said there is still a lot more to come after he scored his 100th Premier League goal during Wednesday&#8217;s 1-1 draw with Everton.The 36-year-old brought up his century of goals almost 15 years on from opening his account for Aston Villa against Newcastle Untied in April 2002 with a simple finish early in the first half at the bet365 Stadium.&#8220;I&#8217;m really pleased. I wasn&#8217;t on 99 for that long so it was nice to get it out of the way. It was a proud moment for myself, I look along that list of players and I&#8217;m very proud and privileged to be among them,&#8221; Crouch told British media.The much-travelled striker became the 26th player to have scored 100 goals in England&#8217;s top flight.&#8220;I still feel good, fit and like I can have an impact at this level,&#8221; said Crouch, who signed a new contract last month.&#8220;Hopefully I&#8217;ll continue to keep scoring goals. I&#8217;ve signed a new deal recently, so the manager (Mark Hughes) feels that I can continue to play.&#8220;I know I can play at this level for a number of years yet. I&#8217;ve never relied on pace, I know the manager played until he was about 40, and I believe I can do the same.&#8221;Stoke, who are ninth in the table, travel to face eighth-placed West Bromwich Albion on Saturday.-Reuters
