Junior athletes Ikageng Gaorekwe and Kabelo Melamu will have the opportunity to develop at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships.The two have been included in the Athletics South Africa (ASA) 50-member provisional squad for the championships in Kampala, Uganda in March.After taking part in the junior race at the national championships, the duo will be competing in their first seasons as senior athletes this year. Congratulations to all athletes in the squad. We wish them well in their attempts to secure final selection to the national team, ASA president Aleck Skhosana said.The squad has been selected on the basis of results of the SA Cross Country Championships in George.It consists of 14 senior men and 12 athletes from each of the senior women, junior men and junior women categories.With no national cross country trials taking place this year, senior athletes and junior men will instead get a chance to prove their fitness at the Johnson Crane 10km race in Benoni on January 29.The junior women will compete for spots in the final team at the 5000m Central Gauteng League Meeting in Germiston on January 21.These events will also afford ASA an opportunity to select a team for the new mixed relay event at the global off-road showpiece.The athletics body has said that it is important for the athletes included in the squads to participate in the two January events in order to be selected for the final team that will compete at the CAA Southern Region Cross Country Championships and the IAAF Championships in Kampala.The final squad for the IAAF Championships, however, will be announced in due course. The IAAF World Cross Country Championships is one of the toughest and most prestigious events on the international athletics calendar and we are confident that we will send a strong team to Kampala, Skhosana said.Also included in the provisional squad are Elroy Galant, who finished 13th in the 5000m final at the Rio Olympics. Galant holds the South African national 5000m record.KGOMOTSO SETHUSHAkgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
