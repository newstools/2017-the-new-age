The ANC has raised its concerns about gang and drug-related crime in the Western Cape and has called for an urgent engagement with Police Minister Nathi Nhleko.The decision was taken at a Provincial Executive Committee lekgotla that helped the ANC to focus its attention on its political opposition and to also craft a strategy to oppose the DA in the Western Cape.In a statement, the ANC called for the demilitarisation of the SAPS, as well as the integration of local police agencies into SAPS. It also demanded that juvenile offenders be separated from adults and be rehabilitated.On provincial housing, the ANC said it has noted the DA s lack of delivery. We resolved to convene an urgent housing summit to deal with waiting lists, corruption, title deeds, rental stock and a review of the housing delivery model. The ANC said it was shocked that more than 9000 pupils were still not placed in schools. We want to know what the plan is for under-performing schools like Langa. On other provincial campaigns, the ANC said it would agitate for more jobs in the clothing, textile and footwear sectors. It also wants the food, canning and beverage industries to be expanded and for local residents to benefit from the new Saldanha Industrial Zone.It would also be campaigning for workers rights, the poor to be housed closer to their places of employment, as well as for a form of rent control in designated parts of Cape Town s inner city.The ANC is determined to start a concerted campaign to identify and isolate racism and intolerance in our province by ensuring that those responsible are brought to book .The lekgotla resolved that in preparation for the national policy conference, the Western Cape would hold its provincial general council, provincial policy and consultative conference from April 21-23.DENNIS CRUYWAGENdennisc@thenewage.co.za
