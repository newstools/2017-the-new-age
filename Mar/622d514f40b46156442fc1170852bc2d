Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe has on Tuesday expressed that government should convene an Indaba where role players in the energy sector would devise means to avoid job losses.Phasiwe&#8217;s comments follow those made by the National Union of Mine Workers who have raised concerns following the power utility&#8217;s plan to shut down five of its coal power stations.The NUM has raised concerns that the closure of power stations Hendrina, Kriel, Komati, Grootvlei and Camden would lead to wide spread job losses describing the inclusion of Independent Power Producer s (IPP) to the energy sphere as &#8220;privatisation brought to Eskom through the back door.&#8221;&#8220;The NUM is extremely saddened that Eskom Board has taken a decision to shut down five power stations without consulting the unions as stakeholders.&#8220;The NUM has noted that the decision is already taken without our involvement to partly privatize Eskom. We view the entrance or the inclusion of IPP to the energy sphere as privatization brought to Eskom through the back door,&#8221; said NUM National Spokesperson, Livhuwani Mammburu, in a statement.However Phasiwe on Tuesday defended the move saying it was government&#8217;s policy to ensure that clean energy is used.&#8220;Renewable energy is part of the energy mix and we want to bring them on board but for us to create space we have to close some of our stations.&#8220;This will be a very gradual phased in process. For example we have closed two units of the Komati power station and we will gradually close a unit here and a unit there.&#8221; said PhasiwePhasiwe added that Eskom, according to government policy, was not in the process of privatisation.&#8220;Government has said that there are no plans to privatise Eskom and the introduction of the renewable energy project should not be defined as privatisation,&#8221; said Phasiwe.The NUM has in light of Eskom&#8217;s decision committed to embark on a national march against the inclusion of IPP&#8217;s to the national grid.The power utility spokesperson said that Eskom implements government policy and therefore any concerns should be directed to government.&#8220;It is a government decision but generally our stakeholders, especially the unions know that we are not a policy maker and therefore if they have any qualms, they will direct them to the Department of Energy and government as a whole,&#8221; said Phasiwe.Eskom has already began the process to register more renewable energy producers and was signing contracts with companies to produce and supply 4,000MW to the national grid.&#8220;Eskom is an agency of government and we implement government decisions. Government as the shareholder will possibly have to call a meeting where everyone will be in one room where we all thresh out a plan to save jobs.&#8221;
