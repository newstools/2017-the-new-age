As the theme of Human Rights Month suggests The year of OR Tambo: unity in action in advancing human rights we are celebrating and commemorating Human Rights Month and day in the year in which OR would have been 100 years old.He dedicated his entire life to the struggle to ensure that we defeat a system that was internationally condemned as a crime against humanity: apartheid.He is also internationally known and respected as a diplomat, statesman, freedom fighter and human rights activist who struggled for freedom, justice and human rights not only in South Africa but in Africa and the rest of the world.Immediately after the Sharpeville massacre on March 21, 1960, HF Verwoerd the then premier of the all white Union of South Africa and leader of the National Party, passed the Unlawful Organisations Act which saw the banning of the ANC and PAC, forcing them into exile. OR was then tasked by the ANC to skip the country and establish an external mission to continue the struggle against white minority rule and domination.He did this with the utmost discipline, dedication and commitment which gained him much respect and admiration within the movement in exile, inside the country, in Africa and the rest of the world until he suffered an unfortunate stroke in 1989.This fact is evident in his own words, which will forever echo in our hearts and minds: The fight for freedom must go on until it is won, until our country is free and happy and peaceful as part of the community of man, we cannot rest. OR Tambo believed in, represented and promoted the spirit of African unity and progressive internationalism. He actively participated in programmes, activities and campaigns for decolonisation and development in the African continent to ensure that the material conditions of the people in the continent are improved.He stood for a just and equitable world order where the poor and underdeveloped nations have a voice in determining their own future and playing an equal and meaningful role in global affairs.During the 1950s and 60s with the rise in defiance campaigns organised by the Congress Alliance, the ANC planned to have a national protest march throughout the country on March 31, 1960 (this date was chosen because it was the anniversary of the 1919 anti-pass march that took place in Bloemfontein) but the PAC, a breakaway group from the ANC in 1959, being a year old then and for reasons known best to itself, decided to have the anti-pass laws march before the ANC s planned date of March 31, 1960.They planned to have it on March 21, 1960, 10 days before.In Sharpeville, near Vereeniging, things went horribly wrong and nasty. On Monday morning on March 21, 1960, the police opened fire on unarmed and innocent African people, killing 69 and wounding more than 130 African people including children and babies. Most of them had bullets in their backs, which was an indication that they were running away from the live bullets.The Sharpeville massacre marked the end of peaceful resistance and the beginning of armed struggle against the apartheid regime.The massacre had serious international implications for the country.The brutality of the then racist apartheid regime was put on the global spotlight.International hostility towards the apartheid regime grew tremendously. South Africa was expelled from the British Commonwealth and March 21 ever since then was declared by the United Nations as the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination globally.What are the lessons we can learn as the current leadership from all walks of life and different political persuasions from the Sharpeville massacre?We have a huge responsibility as the present generation to ensure that we respect and value our freedom and democracy which came at a great price, including the blood of those who were butchered at Sharpeville.We need all of us to defend our freedom and democracy and to consolidate our achievements and gains as a lasting tribute to those who watered the tree of liberation with their blood , in the words of our martyr, Solomon Mahlangu.The massacre should also be a grave warning of the brutal and vicious consequences of racism. African people were brutally butchered by a white minority racist regime that did not value and respect African life and humanity.The ugly resurgence of xenophobia in Gauteng and other parts of the country is a serious indictment to our image and integrity as a country because of our own traumatic and painful past and the support we received from the international community especially Africa in defeating apartheid.We also sincerely believe that we need to contextualise these attacks against African foreign nationals.Research has established that not all South Africans hate foreign nationals but rather the struggle for scarce resources such as opportunities for small scale businesses in the township and informal settlements, the scramble for unskilled jobs in the labour market and the intense competition for opportunities in the survivalist economy triggers these sporadic attacks.These are further exacerbated by criminal activities such as the mushrooming of prostitution brothels, drug dealings and other illegal underground activities.These attacks are mainly criminal and opportunistic in nature and less politically orchestrated.We need to seriously speed up programmes for the integration of African foreign nationals into our communities, consolidate our public education programmes around xenophobia and related intolerances, and intensify our fight against crime syndicates and establishments especially those involving foreign nationals as sustainable ways of dealing with this scourge.These violent attacks against foreign African nationals are not what OR Tambo stood for, neither what the martyrs of the Sharpeville massacre died for.They are gross violations of human rights, extremely reactionary and un-African. They should be condemned with the contempt they deserve.We need to remind those South Africans who are indeed suffering from extreme historical amnesia that we dare not open old wounds by making reckless racist statements and reinventing racist practices, attitudes and stereotypes.This is precisely why we would also like to condemn the statement made by the Premier of the Western Cape, Hellen Zille, in the social media recently, namely that colonialism had positive aspects.This is not only a myopic, sensational, narrow, misconstrued and misinformed interpretation of our history but extremely insensitive and an insult to the victims of colonialism and seeks to justify the economic, social and political plunder of the African continent, physical abuse and torture, exploitation and dehumanisation of the African majority by the colonial settler forces, which effects are still felt today.Colonialism, apartheid, the Holocaust, Zionism and all other inhuman and brutal systems could never be justified under any circumstances; they remain gross violations of fundamental human rights and should be denounced and treated as such.In concluding let us use the celebrations and commemorations of Human Rights Month and Day to fulfil the vision statement set out in the National Development Plan: 2030: South Africa belongs to its people. We, the people belong to one another. We live the rainbow. We dare not disappoint the majority of South Africans and future generations.Gail ParkerGail Parker is ANC chief whip in the Northern Cape provincial legislature, Kimberley
