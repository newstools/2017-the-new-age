THE case of a Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) student arrested for the murder of his roommate has been postponed to February 16 as the state still needs to gather more information from the police s investigation as well as a postmortem report.Hlulani Reuben Chuma 23 also a student at TUT is facing charges of murder after allegedly killing roommate Mbuso Nyambi 22 after an altercation broke out between the two of them at the institution s Lezard men s residence on the Pretoria West Campus.Nyambi was found dead at the scene shortly after the incident.During the court appearance yesterday in the Atteridgeville Magistrate s Court, magistrate Allan Cowan postponed the case to get a postmortem report further investigation into the matter, as well as for the accused to acquire legal aid, as Chuma failed to pay his previous legal representative his full amount. Had you paid your advocate or attorney the full amount if any at all the court s time would not be wasted. I suggest that you apply for legal aid so that you can be represented properly. This is not acceptable. You are wasting my time, Cowan told Chuma.Nyambi was in his final year of an electrical engineering degree.He is survived by his parents and his younger brother Lungani.TUT student representative council president Nkosinathi Maseko said the pair were roommates and had been fighting over a padlock. Apparently, the suspect changed the padlock as he had lost the key and the deceased changed the lock as he didn t have keys to access their room. They ended up arguing. Witnesses said the victim didn t fight back when he was attacked, Maseko said.Chuma is out on bail of R2000. 701270TNA Reporter
