The SA Reserve Bank today announced it would take the public protector’s remedial action calling for amendments to its constitutional mandate on review, and have it set aside. Yesterday Busisiwe Mkhwebane released a damning report on the R1.125bn apartheid era bailout of Absa/Bankorp where she found that the government and the Reserve Bank had failed to recover the “misappropriated funds”. As part of her remedial action, Mkhwebane recommended constitutional amendments be enacted to change the objectives of the Reserve Bank to focus on economic growth rather than currency and price stability, a move the bank has decried.  “The Reserve Bank has consulted its legal team and has been advised that the remedial action prescribed by the public protector falls outside her powers and is unlawful,” the bank said in a statement. The Reserve Bank says it will bring an urgent review to have the remedial action set aside. If Mkhwebane has her way section 224 of the Constitution will be changed to read: “The primary object of the South African Reserve Bank is to promote balanced and sustainable economic growth in the Republic, while ensuring that the socioeconomic well-being of the citizens are protected. “The South African Reserve Bank, in pursuit of its primary object, must perform its functions independently and without fear, favour or prejudice, while ensuring that there must be regular consultation between the Bank and Parliament to achieve meaningful socioeconomic transformation.” In a statement, the bank said: “The Reserve Bank will address its other concerns with the report and evidential factual inaccuracies therein, at the appropriate time,” the bank said. Absa said yesterday it noted the findings it believed it had met all its obligations in terms of the loan provided, adding that “there is no obligation to pay anything to the SA government”. -TNA Reporter
