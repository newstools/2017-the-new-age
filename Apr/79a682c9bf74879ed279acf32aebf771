The magistrate in the OR Tambo R20m heist case said the state s case was subject to serious doubt and granted the three suspects bail.Sibusiso Mnisi was granted bail of R50000 Prince Dube R150 000 and Thando Sonqishe R100000.Magistrate Amukelani Msimeki said the state s case was not strong as they failed to link the suspects to the heist. There is no DNA video footage or other evidence before this court to prove the accused were actually at the scene of the crime, Msimeki said.Hawks investigating officer Col Samuel Mahlangu told the court in an affidavit that the suspects were dressed in police uniform during the robbery and were armed with automatic and semiautomatic rifles.He said at Dube s place of residence they found SBV uniforms and not police uniforms while R7 950 was found at the home of Dube s girlfriend.Msimeki said although the money could be linked to the case it did not provide evidence. This proves that the case has serious doubt as there s not much evidence from the state. Msimeki is also expected to rule on the bail applications of co-accused France Manaka Simon Thokwane and Cosmos Ntanzi today.
