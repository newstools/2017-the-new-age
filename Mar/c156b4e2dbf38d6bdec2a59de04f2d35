Fifteen cases of human trafficking have been dealt with to date by Home Affairs immigration officers at OR Tambo International Airport.Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba yesterday briefed the media on irregular movements of children at ports of entry.This comes after a man was prevented from departing the country on Wednesday with three children with fraudulently acquired travel documents.Gigaba said the department is dealing with three recent cases which involved the attempted trafficking of eight children.He said out of the eight children in recent cases, only two are South African and they have been able to protect them from leaving the country.The department has also been able to protect those who are not from the country. We have prevented the trafficking of 15 children as a result of the robustness of both the system and officials. Immigration officers at OR Tambo are very vigilant and our system is able to pick up irregularities to alert immigration officers, which leads to investigations and the necessary action being taken to prevent trafficking, Gigaba said.The three children in the latest case, are Nigerian nationals, two of whom were born in Nigeria and one in South Africa.Immigration officers are yet to verify the third child that was born in South Africa because there are irregularities.Officers said the children have been placed at a place of safety and the parents were detained due to the minors having been registered by South African mothers through misrepresentation or aiding and abetting. There has been irregular issuance of Home Affairs documents and we are aware that there are South Africans who are assisting foreign nationals in obtaining documents through misrepresentation. It has also been proven that some of these activities are from the same office. Marriage of convenience has also been picked up as one of the issues in this particular case, an officer said.Gigaba said that over the last few days, the department has been dealing with a number of cases of corruption and fraud related to immigration services.He said that at the Ficksburg port of entry, the Hawks arrested 18 individuals, including five Home Affairs officials and 10 police officials, on charges relating to fraud and corruption.Gigaba said the cases highlight the fact that South Africa is a country of origin and destination for child trafficking. We work with various government agencies and NGOs to ensure that once the children have been rescued from those situations, they are kept at places of safety until investigations are completed, he said.He said that action will be taken to close the gaps and diminish the use of South Africa as an origin and destination transit for human trafficking.He further said that the systems in place are working and visa regulations introduced in 2014 said that if one is travelling with a child they must produce an unabridged birth certificate.DIKELEDI RAMABOPA
