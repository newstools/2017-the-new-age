The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) is to consider scrapping the K53 driver license testing system.The corporation&#8217;s chief executive Makhosini Msibi has told Parliament&#8217;s Transport Portfolio Committee that K53 driver license testing system does nothing to shape driver attitude and behaviour.Speaking to SABC Morning Live Msibi said it was time K53 driver license testing system be reviewed.&#8220;We all can recall that we started from the K52 and later went to K53 but it is about time to begin to do the review on the K53,&#8221; said Msibi.The big question is why now . Msibi indicated that there are a number of reasons why they want to review it now, looking at the statistics and the reports has informed them that most of the crashes and fatalities are caused by a drivers attitude which is 90% contributing to most of the fatalities.He added that the K53 focuses on the control of the motor vehicle.Msibi also stated that when a driver has a code 8 and want to move to code 10 a driver will need to wait until they are experienced drivers.&#8220;When you have a code 8, you cannot have a code 10 until you have a five years experience having got a drivers license and after 5 years you can then graduate to a code 10 and a code 14,&#8221; said Msibi.-TNA Reporter
