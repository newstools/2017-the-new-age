The High Court in Pretoria has on Friday set aside the appointment of Hawks head Berning Ntlemeza. Last year The Helen Suzman Foundation (HSF) and Freedom Under Law (FUL) approached the court calling for Ntlemeza’s removal as head of the Hawks. The civil society organisations argued that Ntlemeza did not deserve to hold the position of head of the Hawks because when he was appointed he had two separate court judgements against him. In his 2015 ruling, Judge Elias Matojane said that Ntlemeza was dishonest and lacked integrity and honour. This involved a case where Judge Matojane dismissed an application by Ntlemeza over the suspension of Shadrack Sibiya. HSF’s spokesperson Francis Antoine said Ntlemeza could not be trusted even under oath. On Friday Judge Peter Mabuse while handing down the written judgment made reference to the Matojane ruling against Ntlemeza.   -TNA Reporter
