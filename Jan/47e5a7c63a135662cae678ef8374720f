The Department of Correctional Services is expected to release an investigation report into what led to the violent clashes at St Albans Prison in the Eastern Cape, leading to a complete lock-down two weeks ago.This as prisoners are being moved to institutions in other provinces such as the Free State and Northern Cape in an effort to curb overcrowding.On December 26, three people died when a brawl broke out inside the prison.The situation escalated and 13 prison warders were injured, six critically after being attacked with home-made knives and sharp objects during the brawl.It was also reported that about 20 prisoners were injured during the violent clashes.At the weekend, national commissioner of Correctional Services Zacharia Modise said he hoped to receive the report this week but that depended on the completion of the investigation.Speaking to the New Age, Modise said although he did not have the correct figures at the time of the interview, the number is bit higher. Those who will be coming to the Free State and Northern Cape regions will be taken to various prisons in these provinces. This was to reduce overcrowding after the riots in that prison and also to reduce overcrowding in Pollsmoor and other prisons, Modise said.He said the investigation was under way and the report might be released this week. We are still dealing with overcrowding in various correctional centres not only in the Eastern Cape butin all the provinces, Modise said.According to Modise, the injured warders were back on duty at St Albans prison.Access to the prison is being restricted while the investigation continues.It was reported that prisoners attacked officials with sharp objects and that of the 33 inmates involved, at least eight are serving life sentences.Eastern Cape prisons commissioner Nkosinathi Breakfast met with the prisoners to hear their grievances two days after the incident but the situation remained volatile with prisoners going on hunger strike and some barricading themselves in a prisoncell.Security has also been tightened at a maximum security prison in Limpopo where warders were attacked by more than 50 prisoners a day after the St Albans riots started.The attack was reportedly sparked by a routine body and cell search that the prisoners objected to.BECKER SEMELAbeckers@thenewage.co.za
