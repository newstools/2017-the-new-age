AMERICAN actor Jussie Smollett, one of the lead cast members of the popular drama series Empire, will this weekend interact with his local fans during his visit to the country. Smollett, who plays the role of Jamal Lyon on the hit FOX musical drama series, will hold a press conference at Park Hyatt in Rosebank on Sunday in a bid to get a glimpse of just how popular the show is with local audiences. Although the details of his visit are sketchy, MultiChoice publicist Nthabiseng Motsei said Smollet could also make a stop in Cape Town during his brief stint in SA. “He is here to just basically promote the show, interact with fans and just to see how it is being received this side. Other than that he is here on his personal capacity and might be having a couple of friends who have tagged along,” Motsei said. Smollet made his mark in 2015 when he took on the role of the gay son of music mogul Luscious Lyon, played by Terrence Howard. In the same year, then 31-year-old actor, singer and cooking fanatic took an opportunity to tell the world about his sexuality in an interview with TV show host Ellen DeGeneres, a move that earned him a celebrated spot in the LGBT community.
