WITH the mother city experiencing serious drought conditions, tighter water restrictions came into place yesterday, with further appeals to save water.The city of Cape Town has intensified water restrictions and appealed to all users to further reduce their use of non-essential potable water.The appeal comes as the city sees much lower dam levels compared to the same time in previous years.It is said that if residents do not save water, the city could find itself without water by May. The situation also sees exemptions granted under Level 3 being reviewed with the possibility of being revoked and with the option for reapplication.Water users with exemptions under Level 3 must adhere to Level 3b irrigation days and times. The city claims that it is time that all residents and businesses take the water crisis seriously.The city s mayoral committee member for informal settlements, water and waste services and energy, councillor Xanthea Limberg, said: As at Monday, dam levels had dropped to 39.2 %, which is 1.3 % down from a week ago. With the last 10% of a dam s water being unusable, city supply dam levels could be seen as effectively around 29.2%. Thank you to those residents who are taking great steps to save water.In light of the situation, we need a much greater effort and we call on everyone to work together to protect this precious resource which cannot be replaced. Limberg said consumption remained far too high among many users in formal residential properties, using 65% of the city s water supply.There were particularly high-use areas in the metro such as in Athlone, Newlands, Newfields, Manenberg, Constantia, Lansdowne, Somerset West and Kraaifontein among others, where some households were not doing their bit. Besides the areas listed, there were other high water users in all suburbs across the metro.City officials and the area-based MCMs were targeting the 20 000 highest water users to ensure that they complied with water restrictions and reduced their water consumption. We cannot all suffer because of the abuse of water by some.Some of the highest water users in the metro will soon receive notice from the city to drastically reduce consumption. The city will not hesitate to look at instituting enhanced punitive measures to force consumption down in high-use areas across the metro if required. Water restrictions have been implemented as part of good, proactive management of water supply during times of drought.The city, which uses 40% of the water supplied through the province s water supply system, will continue to lobby the provincial and national governments who regulate the water use of the other users, Limberg said.The city will continue to implement its other key initiatives for water management and conservation and concentrate on water extraction from alternative supply sources while planning for the longer-term with the national Department of Water and Sanitation, which is the custodian of water resources, and other stakeholders in the region.The Level 3b water restrictions which were passed in a council meeting last week will be intensified if residents failed to heed the restrictions.Watering/irrigation (with drinking water from municipal supply) of gardens, lawns, flower beds and other plants, vegetable gardens, sports fields, parks and other open spaces will be allowed only if using a bucket or watering can.No use of hosepipes or automatic sprinkler systems will be allowed.Watering times are not restricted, however, residents are urged to limit their watering to the morning and evening. Watering/irrigation (with municipal drinking water) of flower beds, lawns, vegetables and other plants, sports fields, parks and other open spaces will be allowed only on Tuesdays and Saturdays before 9am or after 6pm for a maximum of one hour per day per property and only if using a bucket or watering can.No use of hosepipes or any sprinkler systems will be allowed. Washing (using potable water) of vehicles and boats will only be allowed if using a bucket.Vehicles and boats must be washed with non-potable water or washed at a commercial car wash. Other restrictions are that no irrigation using potable water would be permitted at city facilities.NADINE FORD-KRITZINGER
