Cash-strapped South African national rugby body SAR got a boost Friday with a three-year sponsorship of the Springboks by a international mobile telecommunications company.The MTN logo will appear on the national team jerseys for the first time Saturday in a season-opening Test against France at Loftus Versfeld stadium in Pretoria.No financial details of the sponsorship were announced when the deal was disclosed during the traditional pre-match team photograph.Media speculation said the deal could be worth about 25 million rand (about $1.95 million, 1.75 million euros) a year.The previous sponsors of the Springboks, one of the four major South African banks, was reportedly worth about 70 million rand a year.SAR announced a loss of 23.3 million rand last year.&#8221;It has been a tough couple of years from a financial perspective for SAR,&#8221; admitted chief executive Jurie Roux at the announcement.&#8220;Our challenges remain, but this partnership marks the crossing of a watershed for SAR.&#8221;South Africa and France are playing a three-Test series with the other fixtures in Durban (June 17) and Johannesburg (June 24).-AFP
