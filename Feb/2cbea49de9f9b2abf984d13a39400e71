German leader Angela Merkel urged Russia&#8217;s Vladimir Putin in a telephone call on Tuesday to use his influence on separatists in eastern Ukraine to stop the violence there, and the two agreed on the need for new ceasefire efforts, a German government spokesman said.Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists have both blamed each other for the latest flare-up in a conflict that has killed some 10,000 people since April 2014.&#8220;The German Chancellor and the Russian President agreed that new efforts must be made to secure a ceasefire and asked foreign ministers and their advisers to remain in close contact,&#8221; government spokesman Steffen Seibert said.Merkel and French President Francois Hollande have long tried to broker an end to the conflict but the two-year-old Minsk peace deal has merely locked the two sides in a stalemate.The United States and European Union have imposed sanctions on Russia. Ukraine and NATO accuse the Kremlin of fuelling the conflict by supporting separatists with troops and weapons &#8211; a charge it denies.The Kremlin, in its description of the Merkel-Putin call, said &#8220;serious concerns were expressed in connection with the escalation of the armed conflict resulting in human losses&#8221;.Kiev is nervous that U.S. President Donald Trump will shift the political balance in Russia&#8217;s favour and that he may consider lifting sanctions against Moscow.-Reuters
