Great concern over large numbers of South Africans travelling to war-torn region to fight for Islamic state and other terror groupsTerrorism experts say that there has been a worrying increase in the number of young South Africans travelling to war-torn Syria to join the Islamic State among other terror groups.The warning comes amid the kidnapping of South African photojournalist Shiraaz Mohamed in Syria. A Cape Town-based organisation has claimed that he was still alive after watching a video of him in captivity.While there s a lack of accurate figures on South Africans in Syria, it is estimated that up to 300 have gone there.South African twins Brandon-Lee and Tony-Lee Thulsie who are accused of planning attacks on numerous institutions including the US embassy were prevented twice in 2015 from travelling to Syria to fight for the Islamic State.A second South African was killed in that country last week.The 25 year- old from Port Elizabeth who died on Thursday was a close friend of the 22 year-old Durban man who died on Tuesday, activist Yusuf Abramjee said.It is believed that man was buried in Syria. The man s brother is also believed to be in Syria fighting for the Mujahedeen militant group.However, the killings have not been confirmed by the International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco) department.Senior counter-terrorism researcher at the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) Martin Ewi yesterday said globally radicalised youth were travelling to fight for Isis in Syria. We have warned the government about young people going to Syria as this poses a threat to the country s security. Since 2014, there has been a rise in youngsters going there. It s no longer a secret that groups like the Islamic State are actively recruiting in the country and through social media, he said.Ewi said that it was critical for the government to launch programmes to deradicalise the youth and warn them about the dangers of travelling to Syria. More research should be done to establish the push and pull factors behind young people going to Syria. De-radicalised programmes should be provided even if they include those who have returned from there. This will help in teaching others about what s really going on on the ground, he said.The Syrian civil war which has claimed thousands of lives and displaced millions of civilians has been on going since 2011.There are a numerous militant groups opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, including the Islamic State and the Free Syrian Army.Brian Dube from the State Security Department said the issue of South Africans going to Syria remained a concern.-Zodidi Mhlana
