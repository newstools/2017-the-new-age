A MINING company operating along the ecologically sensitive west coast started building massive sea walls before the environmental impact assessment (EIA) had been approved, an ANN7 investigation has found.Trans Hex, a diamond mining company, recently acquired by supermarket billionaire Christo Wiese, along with its mining partner West Coast Resources, started the process of building the walls in the Hondeklipbaai area in 2016.The company s EIA was submitted to the Department of Mineral Affairs in December 2016 and the public participation process closed at the end of January. While ANN7 was on site in May investigating this story, the department s permission to go ahead with construction of the sea walls came through.The affected community, largely comprising small scale diamond divers and fisherman, had until this week to lodge their objections. Community activist Dawit Markus explained that it was a David versus Goliath fight. When it comes to the fight between the needy and the greedy, the needy is always at the bottom of the chain, Markus said, conceding that people are so desperate for jobs that they turn a blind eye and that makes it easier for mining companies to perform their dirty tricks.The area, which has the highest unemployment figures for South Africa, has pitifully few job opportunities, mainly in diamond mining, fishing and a small tourism business. The sea walls, or cofferdams as they are technically known, will destroy opportunities in all of these sectors, community activists said.Trans Hex is not the only company working in the area. State-owned mine Alexkor also established cofferdams the local community said and already, this has impacted jobs and marine life. The department, Trans Hex and Alexkor are adamant that the mines are operating within the law.Ekogaia Consulting, in a report for environmentalists, said it appears that the mining was not properly approved under the relevant legislation. To date, it said at least four areas south of Alexander Bay and three around Hondeklipbaai have seen cofferdam constructions. This cofferdam mining, although it was only practiced in extremely limited areas, had measurable impacts on the livelihoods of surrounding communities, the report reads, adding that it was incompatible with the expansion of mariculture and shellfish ranching and the sustainable utilisation of coastal resources and tourism .CECILIA RUSSELL
