Black Land First (BLF) will today receive feedback on the progress of investigations into complaints lodged with the public protector s office.BLF national spokesperson Lindsay Maasdorp said that today s meeting would be the organisation s first engagement with the new public protector, Busi Mkhwebane. They requested to meet with the public protector to discuss progress and process towards the finalisation of the CIEX investigation towards recovering R26bn by the South African Reserve Bank from the monopoly white capital and progress and process towards finalising the BLF complaint of state capture by white monopoly capital .It also wants to make enquiries on behalf of the Bapo Ba Mogale community and Alexandra Small Scale Developers, he said.Public protector spokesperson Oupa Segalwe said the office was not probing events that happened under apartheid. The complaint we are investigating has nothing to do with events that occurred before 1994 as the law does not allow the public protector to look into such matters. Our investigation only has to do with events that occurred in post-apartheid South Africa as alleged in the CIEX report, Segalwe said.The organisation alleges that the R26bn, which it said was stolen under apartheid, was used to establish businesses and a bank.Members of the group last year staged protests and sit-ins at the public protector s office as they were unhappy with the handling of its complaints.While the BFL has accused former public protector Thuli Madonsela of refusing to engage with them on the issues, Segalwe said there had been a number of engagements between the group and the office. The group has exchanged several correspondence with the former public protector in the past two years. Last year, in August, they met with the deputy public protector (DPP) at our invitation. The DPP had been delegated to meet with the group on behalf of the office.They subsequently met with our investigation staff during a follow-up meeting initiated by the office, he said.Maasdorp said: To this end the former public protector, Thuli Madonsela, failed to look into the said matters during her term of office. zodidim@thenewage.co.za
