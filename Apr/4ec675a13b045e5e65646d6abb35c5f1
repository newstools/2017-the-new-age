Julianna Margulies, star of &#8220;The Good Wife&#8221;, plans to produce a television series based on the stories of female reporters during the Vietnam War, the actress told AFP on Friday.The 50-year-old American has teamed up with three other women including a writer and a director for her first production credit.The as yet unnamed series will be based on the book &#8220;War Torn: Stories of War from the Women Reporters Who Covered Vietnam&#8221;.&#8220;We&#8217;re working on a pilot now,&#8221; and have sold the series, said the actress in an interview at the Series Mania festival in the French capital.Margulies recently turned down a role in &#8220;The Good Fight&#8221;, sequel to &#8220;The Good Wife&#8221;, in which her character returns to work as a lawyer after her husband is jailed in a corruption and sex scandal.&#8220;I had to say goodbye to (Good Wife lead character) Alicia Florrick,&#8221; after seven seasons in the role, she said.&#8220;Alicia doesn&#8217;t wear her emotions on her sleeves the way I do. I am an actress and a Jewish woman&#8230; very opinionated and emotional,&#8221; said Margulies, laughing.&#8220;I grew up with her, I got the time to experience her and change with her. I loved the challenge of playing someone very guarded.&#8221;This July, Margulies will play the role of a Syrian Jewish woman who changes her view on life while going through last stage breast cancer treatment.The story, set in Brooklyn, is of a woman who no longer wants to be a complacent housewife, said the actress.As for another television series, Margulies said she now had some conditions for such work.&#8220;I am open to anything, it just can&#8217;t be anything medical or legal,&#8221; said the actress alluding also to her breakout role in medical drama &#8220;ER&#8221;, also setting a 10-episode series limit.&#8220;I can&#8217;t sign up for 22 episodes again, it takes too much out of your life,&#8221; she added.-AFP
