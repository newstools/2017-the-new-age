North Korea hit out Monday at international sanctions targeting sports equipment, claiming the restrictions hindered their ability to compete at an international level.Kim Jong-Un promised in 2015 to transform North Korea into a sports powerhouse &#8220;within a few years&#8221; but the communist state is a virtual pariah owing to its nuclear weapons programme.The country is subject to a host of UN sanctions, with Resolution 2270 &#8212; implemented last March &#8212; specifically barring Pyongyang from importing equipment including skis, yachts, mountaineering boots and even billiard tables.Sporting firearms, ammunition and archery gear is also banned from being exported to North Korea.&#8220;A few European countries and their sportswear businesses are blindly dragged into the wicked attempts of politicising sports,&#8221; Kang Ryong-Kil, Deputy Secretary General of the North&#8217;s Olympic Committee said.&#8220;The thing is that sports firearms can never be turned into rockets nor the rockets be fired from them,&#8221; he said in a statement.Kang claimed the sanctions were part of a &#8220;vicious ulterior political scheme&#8221; to isolate North Korea from international sports competitions, such as the Olympics, and labelled the trade restrictions a &#8220;despicable, illegal and immoral act&#8221;.The statement comes as the UN Security Council is set to hold an urgent meeting following North Korea&#8217;s ballistic missile launch on Sunday.The sanctions imposed in March 2016 following the North&#8217;s fourth nuclear test have challenged the country&#8217;s participation in global sport.In March, football&#8217;s Zurich-based world governing body FIFA said it was withholding around $1.7 million earmarked for North Korean football development projects because of Swiss sanctions against the country.And in May, the Italian parliament raised questions over a North Korean playing in the youth team of Serie A side Fiorentina &#8212; saying the Pyongyang regime might be violating sanctions by skimming his wages.The player left the side in July, according to a club spokesman who acknowledged there had been &#8220;some bureaucratic problems&#8221;.-AFP&nbsp;
