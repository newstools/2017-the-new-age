The National Prosecuting Authority has declined to criminally prosecute three former Department of Public Works officials who were involved in the Nkandla matter, while an inquiry against a contractor was still pending.This was said in a written reply to a question from the leader of the official opposition, Mmusi Maimane, by the Department of Public Works.Maimane had asked in his written question about the status of the 44 criminal cases, 15 civil cases and 64 disciplinary processes that the Special Investigating Unit had recommended be taken against officials involved in the Nkandla scandal.The Minister of Public Works said the SIU had referred evidence for possible criminal action against three and not 44 former senior officials and one contractor involved in the Nkandla matter to the relevant prosecuting authority.. The latter declined to prosecute the three officials and the enquiry against the contractor is apparently still pending, the ministry said.Public Works said the SIU had instituted a civil claim (not 15 cases) against Makhanya Architects, the principal architect in the Nkandla matter, in the KwaZulu-Natal High Court. The proceedings were pending.Public Works also said the SIU has referred evidence for possible disciplinary action against 12 (not 64) employees who were involved in the Nkandla matter to the department. The department instituted disciplinary actions against all 12 of the employees.One employee pleaded guilty and he was found guilty of misconduct. The penalty was suspension without pay and a final written warning. One of the employees died. The disciplinary hearings against the remaining 10 employees have commenced. The names of 12 officials who were subjected to disciplinary hearings cannot be disclosed until the cases have been finalised.On a question of how many employees had received bonuses in the past five years, Public Works said that between April 1, 2012 and March this year, six employees were given performance bonuses. The amounts were R28702.87, R11205.66, R60766.85, R42097.35, R57210.65 and R22759.97.DENNIS CRUYWAGENdennisc@thenewage.co.za
