SOUTH Africa is nowhere near eradicating the bucket toilet system, a senior national Treasury official told Parliament.A presentation given by the Water and Sanitation Department to the Water and Sanitation Portfolio Committee in Parliament yesterday revealed the first attempt to wipe out the bucket system was an initiative launched during Thabo Mbeki s term as president.National Treasury chief director Ulrike Britton said the new initiative was originally a two-year programme meant to cost R1.7bn. We still haven t eradicated the bucket system. We can see they are nowhere near completing the programme, Britton said.Initially, she said it was estimated that 88000 bucket toilets had to be eradicated across South Africa at a cost of R20000 a unit. Fresher estimates have set the figure at 54000. Britton said the department was sitting with invoices totalling R1.5bn for bills not paid in the 2016-17 financial year.Britton said that the first bucket eradication programme had been completed. The new programme, Bucket Eradication Programme 2, was aimed at formal housing, she said. In her presentation, Britton talked about the department s pre-audit figures. She said that Water Affairs and Sanitation sat with invoices totalling R1.5bn.The total overspending amounted to R110m, which was largely due to spending mostly on bucket eradication. This matter would have to be explained to the Standing Committee on Public Accounts. In the 2016-17 financial year, the department spent 86% of its main budget.In a major adjustment, R65m was shifted to bucket eradication, while R37m was moved to goods and services. Britton said the department had a vacancy rate of 21.9% with 960 vacant posts.The Treasury expressed concern about spending on goods and service and how the department used consultants to implement programmes. Of the War on Leaks, Britton said there was no ring-fenced money within the budget for this.DENNIS CRUYWAGEN dennisc@thenewage.co.za
