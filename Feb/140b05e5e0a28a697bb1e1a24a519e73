Hawks boss Lt-Gen Mthandazo Ntlemeza has called on forensic investigator Paul O Sullivan to stop feeding South Africans with well-orchestrated lies through his partisan media.Ntlemeza slammed the private investigator for misleading the nation in the so-called Joining the Dots document, which has targeted prominent people such as President Jacob Zuma, National Prosecuting Authority head Shaun Abrahams, Gauteng Hawks head Lt-Gen Prince Mokotedi and acting police commissioner Lt Gen Khomotso Phahlane.The document was thrust into the spotlight following reports of alleged discussions between private investigator Paul O Sullivan and Ipid head Robert McBride. The document, commissioned by AfriForum and written by O Sullivan, links various cases that have fallen off the National Prosecution Authority s radar.In a statement yesterday Ntlemeza said if O Sullivan has any dots to join, he should do so within the ambit of the law and stop feeding the residents of this country with well-orchestrated lies through his partisan media.He said he was more concerned about the malicious, baseless accusations which seeks to compromise or to undermine the sovereignty of the country, calculatingly destabilise the justice system, make wild accusations against senior government officials, journalists, business people and more importantly denting the image of the DPCI. O Sullivan is prepared and will stop at nothing in his quest to tarnish the image of the Hawks, the integrity of the justice system and reverse all the gains the country has attained post 1994. If the dots he had joined thus far proves some degree of criminality against certain individuals, why doesn t Paul O Sullivan Join The Dots the right way, he said.Last week O Sullivan said he was no longer going to speak to The New Age. I flatly refuse to engage with anyone at The New Age, or ANN7, it is clear that they are both being used for propaganda only, he said.Ntlemeza said O Sullivan s hidden agenda was to cause political instability, halt the development momentum and economic growth that South Africa has achieved and above all, to install his own team in strategic government positions that would be indebted to him and those who fund his despicable activities. O Sullivan must however, rest assured that no length of any report he might write will deter the Hawks from executing its constitutional mandate without fear, favour and prejudice, he said. 701371-TNA REPORTER
