A Cape Town family has defended an advert in which they seek a &#8216;pleasant-smelling domestic worker&#8217; who will be paid R2 000 per month, below the minimum wage.In an advert posted on Gumtree, Mrs Allie stated that they are looking for a pleasant-smelling person who will work seven days a week.&#8220;You must have a valid passport which I keep while you work for me. and no criminal records. Salary starts at R2 000 plus food and accommodation,&#8221; said Mrs Allie in her post.She also stated that she will increase her salary to R2 500 after the first month if she is capable of doing all the work as required.Speaking to News24, Mrs Allie&#8217;s husband Abubkar Allie said that there was nothing wrong with stipulating what they required, and paying below the minimum wage.He defended the decision to hold the domestic worker&#8217;s passport, while working for the family.&#8220;You see, what happened before is we had stuff stolen in our home, clothes and stuff, and we needed a guarantee that it won t happen again,&#8221; the husband said.He added that as a family they preferred foreign domestic workers, particularly Zimbabweans because they have worked with them before.In 2016, the Department of Labour released the legal minimum wage for domestic workers who work more than 27 ordinary hours per week: Area A (those in major metropolitan areas) will earn R12.42 (R11.44: 2015/2016) hourly rate, R559.09 (R514.82: 2015/2016 ) weekly rate and R2422.54 (R2230.70: 2015/2016) monthly rate.-TNA Reporter
