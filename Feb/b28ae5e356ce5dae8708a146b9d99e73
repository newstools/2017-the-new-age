WITH Usain Bolt having announced his plan to hang up his spikes this year, speculation about the next king of the track has been rife. Last year, the 100m and 200m legend said the 2016 Rio Olympics was his last one as he has achieved everything he wanted in the sport.The Jamaican legend has ruled the 100m and 200m for more than a decade and is set to retire after the World Championships in London. South Africa s 100m sprinting sensation Akani Simbine has had his name being mentioned among those to watch at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games in the absence of Bolt. The 23-year-old Simbine understands the two events will never be the same without Bolt and whoever takes over as the next king of the track has big shoes to fill. Taking over from Bolt it s a big thing because he is a great guy and the king of athletics, so it s huge, Simbine said. It s also a big responsibility because the track depends on the 100m and 200m sprints. It depends on us running fast and bringing the crowd and doing the best we can so that we keep attracting people to come to a stadium. And we have to make sure that athletics remains a big deal in the sports industry. Simbine has been afforded another chance to train with Bolt in Jamaica in June after having done so before last year s Rio Olympics and this time he hopes to inherit his greatness. So going to Jamaica I feel like I am going to pick up everything I can from him, try to pick his brain so that by the time he is gone I can implement it in my running. sithembisod@thenewage.co.za-Sithembiso Dindi
