We invite the alliance partners if we have invited the ANC but following the issues that other unions were raising to highlight the contradiction, we stopped doing that. We have not invited him to speak as we talk now. During the Cosatu May day commemoration event Zuma and his &#8220;allies&#8221; were booed while Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa was cheered and welcomed.Cosatu was then forced to cancel Zuma s speech and other addresses at the rally it had organised after Members of the South African Democratic Teachers Union and Nehawu would not allow Zuma to speak.The party s national spokesperson, Zizi Kodwa, said despite early warning signs that Zuma s presence at a Cosatu event would get a hostile reception, the ANC decided to deploy him while being prepared for any eventuality. When we took the decision to deploy him, we anticipated that such restlessness could arise but the ANC had to deliver a message and we couldn t say that its leadership can t attend.Kodwa s comments came on the back of the ANC s alliance partner s May Day rally having been called off due to crowds affiliated to Cosatu unions booing and heckling Zuma before the event began.-TNA Reporter
