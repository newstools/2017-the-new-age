Chelsea striker Diego Costa has no interest in a lucrative move to a Chinese club because it would jeopardise his chances of playing in next year&#8217;s World Cup.Recent speculation has linked him with Chinese Super League club Tianjin Quanjian.After losing the FA Cup final to Arsenal despite scoring his team&#8217;s goal, however, he told Spanish media that former club Atletico Madrid were the only team he would leave for.&#8220;If the club want to sell me, there&#8217;s one club I&#8217;d move to,&#8221; he was quoted as saying, agreeing that it was Atletico, who he left three years ago to join Chelsea.&#8220;I will remain (at Chelsea) if there is intention from the club and the coach for me to stay, but if they want to sell me to bring in another striker, I will go.&#8221;It will not be to China, he insisted.&#8220;People talk too much, people talk about China but there&#8217;s a World Cup coming up and if I go to China I won&#8217;t have the chance of going to it.&#8221;Costa, Chelsea&#8217;s top scorer as they won the Premier League this season, played two games for Brazil in 2013 but switched to Spain a year later after being granted Spanish citizenship and represented them at the 2014 World Cup.-Reuters
