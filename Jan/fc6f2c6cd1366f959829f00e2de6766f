Olivier Giroud&#8217;s scoring streak continued as he struck late to give Arsenal a 2-1 victory at Championship side Preston North End in the FA Cup third round on Saturday.Giroud&#8217;s deflected finish in the 89th minute was rough on Preston who had dominated the opening period after Callum Robinson had given them an early lead.Arsenal were a different proposition after the break and equalised a minute after the restart when Ramsey fired home from the edge of the area after Alex Iwobi&#8217;s lay-off.The hosts looked capable of holding out for a replay but Giroud struck for the fourth match in a row when he capitalised on a clever back heel by Lucas Perez.Preston were left to rue missed chances before the break, the best of which saw Jordan Hugill somehow fail to connect with a Robinson cross with the goal gaping.Robinson also had a goal ruled out for an infringement.-Reuters
