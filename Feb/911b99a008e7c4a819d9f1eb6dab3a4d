Challenges facing teachers in the province are many and varied. Not only do they have to deal with motivating and teaching pupils from poor communities, they also have to be innovative to ensure that their charges are not disadvantaged because of a lack of resources.Under the dire circumstances that exist in many rural schools, where there are no teacher support systems and no incentives for both teachers and pupils, a hero of Steve Kumkani Jack s calibre emerges.Jack has been a teacher for almost 28 years.His career has taken him to different parts of the province including some cities and now he is teaching at Smuts High School in the small village of eNkgana in Libode district.Despite all the challenges he has encountered as a teacher in the Eastern Cape, Jack remains motivated and works hard to ensure for a better future for the youth in his community.He was preparing to give a 5.30pm extra class to Grade 12 pupils and he acknowledged to The New Age that not all students were able to attend these classes due to problems of staying far from the school and not having transport after the classes.Jack said as a teacher in the rural areas he has taken on more duties and responsibilities.This is different to suburban schools where teachers just teach one subject to one grade and no other classes. Rural teachers teach multiple grades and subjects, they may even be required to lead activities and events after working hours. Many times you find schools with textbooks that are outdated and teachers must find new and free materials to keep pupils informed, Jack said.He has extra classes in the mornings before school starts and on Saturdays to accommodate pupils who are not able to attend after school and unlike teachers in big cities who get paid for extra lessons, Jack doesn t even expect to get a cent. I do not receive any extra income for the extra classes but it is not about the money. Parents of children attending urban schools pay for their extra classes, in rural areas there is no such. One needs love, drive and passion for this career in order to put in extra time for pupils, Jack said.His commitment to his pupils is unwavering. He said he would always make time for his family and his extended family members, adding that he is a family man first and a father to the youth of the community.But he is critical of the lack of support from the communities especially when it comes to protecting school property. Perhaps if the community had respect for education there would be some developments but they are not ambitious about education. When we bought computers they were stolen by community members and there were some staff members who had a hand in this, he said.SISANDA MADWANTSIprovinces@thenewage.co.za
