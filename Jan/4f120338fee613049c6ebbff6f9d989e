STORMERS coach Robbie Fleck has taken positives from his side s 43-7 win over the Cheetahs in a warm up match. The two teams are preparing for the upcoming Super Rugby season, which begins next month. The Cape Town team, alongside the Cheetahs, Lions and Bulls travelled to Zimbabwe this past week to drum up more fans in the neighbouring country and make their brands more visible.Scrumhalf Godlen Masimla gave the Stormers coach something to think about with two tries, while Damian de Allende also crossed the whitewash. Many facets of the Stormers play came together, much to the delight of their hard to please coach. It is a good start, all the goals we set ourselves for this weekend were achieved. We saw glimpses of the hard work we did in pre-season, but we are certainly not there yet and we still have a long way to go, Fleck said. We scored some decent tries from turnover ball and it is always nice when you see results from what you have been working on. As management there were a few things that excited us, but there are definitely aspects that still need work. There are four weeks until our opening game against the Bulls. While the Bulls, Lions and Cheetahs have been regular visitors to Zimbabwe, this was the Stormers first excursion. This is a great tournament and definitely something that we would look forward to coming back to again. It was great to play here and connect with our fans in Zimbabwe. The team will return to South Africa today to continue their preparations for the 2017 rugby season.mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za-Mmasekepe Matsebane
