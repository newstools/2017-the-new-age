Nintendo on Friday unveiled its new Switch game console, which works both at home and on-the-go, as it looks to offset disappointing Wii U sales and go head to head with rival Sony&#8217;s hugely popular PlayStation 4.The hybrid device comes as Nintendo dips its toe into the mobile gaming market after scoring a big win for its brand in the summer with the success of Pokemon Go .The company said its new console was full of Nintendo&#8217;s &#8220;entertainment DNA&#8221; with elements of earlier devices including the 3DS handheld device and motion-senor Wii.Before the event, Daiwa Securities described the unveiling as &#8220;a key turning point for Nintendo s earnings and share price&#8221;.
