Some of the officers working at the O.R Tambo have let us down and taken bribes from criminals, said Police minister Fikile Mbalula. Mbalula said this on Monday while briefing media on security concerns at Africa’s busiest airport O.R Tambo. #ORTambo Mbalula says police at the airport have not been doing their job @The_New_Age and are involved in corruption pic.twitter.com/8I9kB6WNsc — Kutullo (@kutulloMadisha) July 10, 2017 “We are going to clean out the airport and make sure there is a plan to combat crime. The honeymoon is over, we will no longer have people deployed here for over ten years,” said Mbalula.

We will evaluate our plan on a daily and weekly basis,” said Mbalula. Minister of State Security David Mahlobo who was part of the briefing stated that they have agreed that the security architecture of the country has to change including at ports of entry. “We can’t take chances with the territory which is South Africa,” said Mahlobo.  -TNA Reporter
