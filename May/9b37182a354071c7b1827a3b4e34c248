A number of South African political and public figures have thrown their weight behind Palestinian prisoners who have been on hunger strike for almost a month.Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi, Communications Minister Ayanda Dlodlo and Science and Technology Minister Naledi Pandor are among the government officials taking part in a 24-hour fast, which started yesterday.Palestinian prisoners have been on a hunger strike since April 17 demanding an end to Israel s detention without trial, among other issues.Ramaphosa and others will take part in the fast as part of the #DignityStrikeSA campaign, which calls on South Africans to embark on a 24-hour hunger strike in solidarity with the Palestinian prisoners.The campaign is spearheaded by the National Coalition for Palestine, an umbrella body representing more than 40 South African civil society structures.The participants have gone without food since 6pm yesterday and are expected to break the fast at 6pm today. They, like the Palestinian prisoners, will only drink water during the strike. May 15 was symbolically selected for the #DignityStrikeSA campaign to mark the Nakba (Catastrophe) that saw Palestinians being forced to flee their homeland in 1948 and the establishment of Israeli occupation. We welcome the endorsement by the deputy president. Ramaphosa s commitment to the campaign sends a strong message that South Africa stands with the Palestinian people in their quest for freedom and dignity, director of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, Neeshan Balton, said. His support is globally significant as he might possibly be the most senior politician endorsing the demands of the Palestinian prisoners. The solidarity hunger strike will be accompanied by pickets at provincial legislatures in various cities across the country on May 15 from 12pm to 2pm.It will culminate with a solidarity rally at Constitutional Hill at 6pm.There are more than 6500 Palestinian political prisoners detained in Israel. There are more than 500 Palestinians held under Israel s administrative detention , while 25 Palestinian journalists and 13 Palestinian parliamentarians are also being incarcerated in Israeli prisons.Former Robben Island prisoners Ebrahim Ebrahim, 79, Laloo Chiba, 86, and Kehla Shubane are also taking part along with former African Union chairperson Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe and his deputy.
