South Africa enters its last period this month, during which it will receive above-normal rainfall but with its dams not full to the brim.The country s dam levels stand at an average 65%. Weather forecasters predicted three months ago that the November-December-January period would see above normal rains accompanied by flash floods across most parts of the country.However, the festive season has seen very little rainfalls and the increasing heat in most provinces is beginning to raise alarm about the availability of sufficient water during the dry winter season.The release of water from the Sterkfontein dam into the Vaal dam came at a time when the Gauteng dam, at 26%, was teetering on dangerously low water levels. The prospect of a dry Vaal dam would spell an unprecedented disaster for Gauteng, the country s economic hub.We heaved a collective sigh of relief when the combination of water from Sterkfontein and recent heavy downpours raised levels at the Vaal Dam to a decent level.But unless we experience heavy downfalls in the remaining summer months, the country might be plunged into yet another water crisis that will see further water-saving measures such as water restrictions and water cuts.As matters stand, most provinces are still reeling from the effects of water restrictions imposed by municipalities at the height of the devastating drought.The debilitating drought has been with us since 2014 and has caused untold damage to crops and livestock. However, the novelty of the La Nina phenomenon has raised hopes among South Africans as most parts of the country received heavy downpours since mid-November last year.Regrettably, the rains were accompanied by flash floods in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal that claimed human lives and damaged property. The floods raised concern that we might be poised to swing from one disaster, the drought, to another, constant floods.What should be done then, in the light of weather patterns that yield less rain than expected?There can be no better solution to the problem than saving as much water as we possibly can. Efforts to save water should be the responsibility of every concerned citizen instead of it being the duty of the government alone.While the government has taken initiatives to embark on water-saving campaigns, it is incumbent upon all of us as responsible citizens and water consumers to come on board and save the country from a looming natural disaster. With rainfall of 450mm a year, South Africa receives just over half the rainfall compared to the world average of 800mm in the same period.In Europe for instance, where it rains throughout the year, it is regarded as a natural disaster of dangerous proportions if it does not rain for a period of two weeks.Geographically, South Africa is part of a continent less provided with water resources.As we use water we need to do so against the background of the World Bank rating South Africa among the 30 countries in the world that run the risk of becoming a desert in 40 years unless we embark on vigorous campaigns to save water.So far we seem to have heeded the warning as we have embraced various government campaigns spearheaded by the Department of Water and Sanitation to save the precious resource. In our attempts to save water, we must disabuse ourselves of the notion that because rainwater comes from the skies we therefore shouldn t panic and can use water negligently. The fact is we lose substantial amounts of water to the sea and evaporation.Historically, South Africa has nine big dams and 211 smaller ones. The statistic does not include thousands of privately owned dams on farms across the country. Yet in a semi-arid country like ours, one cannot store enough water.The government cannot build more dams without risking degrading the environment or violating cultural norms. This includes the removal of communities and their livestock and the relocation of graves. Furthermore, the process of applying for the construction of a dam has been made even more difficult by the difficult rules of the World Commission on Dams that applicant countries must adhere to before approval.There are other elementary methods of storing water such as water harvesting. The use of water tanks in peri-urban and rural areas is some form of guarantee of water availability for impoverished communities.At the height of the drought the department invested millions of rands in water harvesting through the purchase of water tanks.Water harvesting is used for basic needs such as cooking, drinking and washing.Against this background, it is therefore vital that all South Africans should strive to saving water to sustain us through the dry winter season.Themba KhumaloThemba Khumalo is a content developer at the Department of Water and Sanitation
