 TOBACCO threatens us all is the global message as today marks World No Tobacco Day. Various organisations and governments around the world have voiced their concern over the trail of destruction left by tobacco use.Tobacco related diseases and deaths, poverty through income loss due to tobacco use and environmental degradation are just some of the harmful effects of tobacco.The World Health Organisation (WHO) is leading the call for governments globally to implement strong tobacco control measures.A WHO report showed that tobacco control measures can help prevent millions of people from tobacco-related illnesses and deaths, combat poverty and reduce large scale environmental degradation.The report states that tobacco waste contains over 7 000 toxic chemicals poisonous to the environment while up to 10 billion of the 15 billion cigarettes sold daily are disposed in the environment. Tobacco threatens us all. Tobacco exacerbates poverty, reduces economic productivity, contributes to poor household food choices, and pollutes indoor air, WHO director-general Dr Margaret Chan, said. The report details how children miss out on education due to working on tobacco farms and how women farm workers are exposed to hazardous chemicals.Another key finding was that tobacco smoke emissions contribute thousands of tons of human carcinogens, toxicants, and greenhouse gases to the environment.Tobacco waste is listed as the largest type of litter globally while cigarette butts are said to account for 30 to 40% of items collected in coastal and urban clean-ups. But by taking robust tobacco control measures, governments can safeguard their countries futures by protecting tobacco users and non-users from these deadly products, generating revenues to fund health and other social services, and saving their environments from the ravages tobacco causes, Chan said.The South African government is set to introduce plain cigarette packaging as part of the measures to address tobacco use in the country. While considerable gains have been made in reducing tobacco use over the past 23 years, tobacco use and its determinants need to be monitored to ensure that tobacco control strategies remain effective.Tobacco use has no benefits at all, the national Department of Health said. The department said smoking remains the country s leading cause of preventable diseases and lung cancer deaths. It is also a major contributor to tuberculosis and heart disease.An earlier report by the WHO found that while progress was being made in controlling the global effects of tobacco, concerted efforts were needed to ensure progress is maintained and accelerated. Measures to reduce tobacco use have long been met with resistance by the tobacco industry, citing among other reasons, possible job losses.LERATO DIALE
