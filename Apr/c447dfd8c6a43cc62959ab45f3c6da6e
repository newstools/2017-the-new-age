This Friday, the iconic South African stage production Sophiatown will return under the directorship State Theatre artistic director and award-winning playwright Aubrey Sekhabi.The newly re-imagined production will open at the State Theatre in Pretoria and will run until May 14.Sekhabi will direct a pool of young cast members. These include Thabiso Tshabalala as Jakes, Caitlin Clerk as Ruth, Terrence Ignacious Ngwila as Mingus, Kenneth Mlambo as Fahfee, Simphiwe Ndlovu as Princess, Madge Kola as Mamariti, Zamah Ngubane as Lulu and Bongani Masango as Charlie.When Sophiatown premiered at the Market Theatre in the 80s, it received rave reviews and walked away with several awards.Sekhabi has taken over the reins and will have to convince critics and director Malcolm Purkey, who will be among the guests, by taking the cast through the rich history of the musical and its legacy.The mixed-race suburb of Sophiatown is known in the history books for its high fashion and for producing some of the country s most successful musicians, politicians and entrepreneurs in the 1950s while defying the laws of that time at the height of apartheid.Much of Sophiatown s spirit is captured in the exuberant musical created more than 30 years ago by the Junction Avenue Theatre Company, with icons such as Purkey, William Kentridge, Ramolao Makhene, Arthur Molepo and many others.It is hard to imagine that Sekhabi, who was one of Purkey s students when he acquired his dramatic arts honours degree in 1991 at Wits University, would 25 years later be at the helm one of the country s iconic productions.Sophiatown is an imaginative reconstruction of an extraordinary story of journalists who set up a house together and advertised for another housemate to come and live with them. Despite the apartheid legislation of those days, they managed to obtain permission for a white Jewish woman to move in. This character was Ruth Golden from Yeoville, who turned up with a suitcase on the Sophiatown doorstep of explosive journalist, Jakes. The challenge was integration.The play is interspersed throughout with acapella harmony and original songs from the period about Sophiatown, or Kofifi, as it was fondly known.Sekhabi s directing is popularly known in famous productions including Kalushi, the story of Solomon Mahlangu, Revonia Trial, Silent Voices and Marikana The Musical, to name a few.In 2015, his two plays, Hungry and Marikana The Musical, received an unprecedented 18 Naledi Theatre Award nominations, out of which he won six for Marikana The Musical.For his contribution, his works were nominated more than 60 times and won numerous awards along the way.Since 2002, Sekhabi has been the artistic director of the South African State Theatre in Pretoria, where he established the development department and went on to produce many productions to make the theatre more accessible to previously disadvantaged artists and audiences.siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
