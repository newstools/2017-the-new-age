A 25-year-old man arrested for human trafficking is expected to appear again in the Seshego Magistrate s Court next week.The suspect was found with four Zimbabwean captives at his house at Chebeng village outside Polokwane when he was arrested.Raymond Sithole was arrested by the Hawks last week following information that four Zimbabwean youths were found locked in his house at the village.Sithole has since appeared briefly in court and was denied bail. The case was postponed to next week Thursday. The four Zimbabweans, aged between 15 and 20, were smuggled into the country with false promises of good jobs and better lives. But we found them locked in the house and the key was found on the suspect. They were allegedly forced to steal and to work for the suspect without payment and brutally assaulted if they did not comply with his instructions, Hawks provincial spokesperson Capt Matimba Maluleke said.Directorate for priority crime investigation provincial head Thobeka Jozi commended the officers who took part in rescuing the captives. We warn those engaged in human trafficking that Limpopo will never be used as gateway to exploit the innocent and vulnerable, Jozi said.Meanwhile ,a 29-year-old Zimbabwean who allegedly ran a bogus home affairs office at Beitbridge border post with Zimbabwe in Musina last week will apply for bail in the Musina Magistrate s Court today. Duncan Danda was allegedly stamping passports of foreign nationals at the Beitbridge taxi rank. Among other things, officers confiscated home affairs immigration stamps, an undisclosed amount of US dollars and cash believed to have been paid to him by foreign nationals, Maluleke said.MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
