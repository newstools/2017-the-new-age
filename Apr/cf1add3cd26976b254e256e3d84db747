The ANC in the North West has dispelled fears that their its views with Cosatu and the SACP over Brian Molefe s appointment as a Member of Parliament representing the province in the national legislature have strained the relationship of the alliance partners.Both Cosatu and the SACP have been critical of the manner that Molefe, a former chief executive officer of Eskom, was appointed to the legislature saying they were never consulted by the relevant ANC structures during the process.Cosatu believes the former Eskom head is not suitable to represent the ANC at such a level as he has been fingered in a state of capture report compiled by former public protector Thuli Madonsela.Molefe, who resigned from his position at Eskom last year, has expressed unhappiness at not being given a chance by Madonsela to defend himself before the release of the report to the public.In a bid to get to the bottom of why the ANC did not brief alliance partners regarding their intentions to endorse Molefe as an MP, Cosatu has requested a meeting with the provincial executive committee of the governing party.However, Dakota Legoete, secretary of the ANC in the province, told The New Age the meeting was yet to take place. We planned to have the discussions last week but they failed to take place because the dates clashed with by-elections that were supposed to be held in Moretele, Legoete said. The by-elections have since been rescheduled so, hopefully, we will be able to meet with Cosatu soon, he said.Legoete confirmed that the meeting would centre on ironing out the differences and misunderstandings that emerged during the circumstances leading up to Molefe s appointment as an MP. Let me say that the relationship we have with Cosatu is still healthy in every aspect. If this was not the case, then we would not be talking about such a meeting. The ANC, Cosatu and the SACP are independent alliance partners. So it is well within Cosatu s rights to raise their objections about such issues. Whenever such objections arise, it does not mean there is a collision. We are confident the meeting will be positive and fruitful for both organisations, Legoete said.Cosatu has already said the meeting is not meant to pressure the ANC into reversing its decision to appoint Molefe.The labour federation says it will raise matters of principle that they feel should always guide all alliance partners when they are deciding on candidates for key positions within the government.provinces@thenewage.co.za
