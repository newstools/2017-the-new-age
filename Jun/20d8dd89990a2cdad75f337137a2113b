South Africa has been hit by a massive poultry imports ban involving five regional countries including Namibia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Mozambique and Botswana.This is as a result of the bird flu outbreak in various farms of Mpumalanga and the Free state.A recent case of H5N8 virus has been confirmed and detected at the breeding facility on the outskirts of the Free State.South Africa stopped the sale of live chickens throughout the country on Monday in a bid to control the outbreak on the farm of a commercial broiler breeder last week.Botswana, which imports 5% of its poultry needs, said it would no longer buy poultry meat, processed products and feeds from South Africa.Botswana Agriculture Minister Patrick Ralotsia told a news agency: &#8220;The restriction is a precautionary measure to avoid equal infection here as well as to protect our people.&#8221;Poultry producer Astral has reported quarantined the affected site and culled 150000 birds, about 6% of its breeding stock at a farm at its breeding facilities in the Free State.TNA Reporter
