The Ndebele people could soon find themselves tuned into their own TV channel broadcasting all programmes in their mother tongue.The availability of the Ndebele television channel is a bid to strengthen the usage and recognition of this Nguni language like the other official languages in the country. Ndebele, Swati and others are known to be previously marginalised languages and are still lagging behind in terms of development.Ndebele King Makhosoke II announced the introduction of the TV station during the 37th commemoration of the late Ndebele king Silamba in Komjekejeke near Walmansthal outside Pretoria at the weekend. Komjekejeke was declared a national heritage site in 1989 by the National Monuments Council of South Africa after the establishment of the King Silamba Trust in 1985.Silamba ruled the Ndebele nation during the time of the Dutch colonial encroachment. The significance of Silamba s annual commemoration was to enhance cultural improvement and revive the history of the Ndebele nation. Makhosoke II was affirmed the king of the Ndebele nation in South Africa by President Jacob Zuma in 2009 following the recommendation by the Nhlapo commission on traditional leadership disputes.The monarch said hopes were high that the TV station could go on air in June this year since they had already put in a broadcasting application with the relevant broadcasting authorities. He said it was essential for every person to be proud of their roots.But he was worried, because the majority of his subjects, particularly the young people, were no longer willing to fully practise their cultural activities and others were studying at so-called model C schools where the Ndebele language was not offered. Plans are at an advanced stage for the establishment of the TV station. We have submitted applications for approval and if our plans succeed, the station will go live in June this year, Makhosoke II said.The king established the Ndebele kingdom s trust fund a few years ago with the sole purpose of assisting passionate pupils, especially from impoverished households, to pursue Ndebele at the University of Venda in Limpopo following an agreement between the kingdom and the university.-France Nyaka|francen@thenewage.co.za
