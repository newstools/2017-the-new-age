If Paris St Germain are to stand a chance of upsetting Barcelona at their Champions League last-16 first leg on Tuesday, there is one thing they must focus on, coach Unai Emery said on Monday.&#8220;The most important thing will be to win the challenges otherwise tactics will mean nothing,&#8221; he told a news conference.PSG have been eliminated in the quarter-finals twice, in 2013 and 2015, by Barca, who will start the tie as favourites.&#8220;We know this team very well and that&#8217;s an advantage. This tie is the perfect occasion for the club to grow,&#8221; Emery said.He added that he would make a decision later on Monday on whether Argentine midfielder Javier Pastore, who has resumed training after an injury, would be called up in the squad.-Reuters
