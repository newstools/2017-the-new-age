Scientists today announced that the original Homo Naledi remains from the Dinaledi Chamber has been revealed to be startlingly young in age.Homo naledi, which was first announced in September 2015, was alive sometime between 335 000 and 236 000 years ago. This is the first time that it has been demonstrated that another species of hominin survived alongside the first humans in Africa, Wits University said in a statement.The research was published today in three papers in the journal eLife (elifesciences.org), presents the age of the naledi fossils from the Dinaledi Chamber.&nbsp;In addition, Wits announced, that a new cave was discovered in the Rising Star cave system, containing additional naledi specimens, including a child and a partials skeleton of an adult male with a remarkably well-preserved skull.This added to the evidence which suggested that Homo naledi was involved in some burial ritual.The team by Professor Lee Berger included a large team from Wits, James Cook University, Australia, The University of Wisconsin, Madison U.S and 30 other institutions were involved in the study.The dating of naledi was surprising. It was expected that the bones would be dated to around 2-million years and be contemporary with earliest known fossil members of our genus. The dating of naledi was extremely challenging, said Professor Paul Dirks of James Cook University and Wits, explaining that six independent dating methods constrained this species to the late Middle Pleistocene.Homo Naledi, therefore shared the earth with its modern counterpart Homo Sapiens.This could explain the complex behavior &#8211; such as burial of the dead, self-adornment and complex tools.
