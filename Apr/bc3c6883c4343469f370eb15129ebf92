At the back of their humiliating defeat in the Nedbank Cup, Bidvest Wits have no choice but to pick themselves up and soldier on in their Caf Confederations Cup clash tomorrow.Wits, knocked out of the Nedbank Cup last 16 by Jomo Cosmos on Tuesday, host Egyptian side Smouha in the continental tournament at the Bidvest stadium at 3pm. This is the first leg of the Confederations Cup playoffs, with the side that will prevail as eventual winners of the tie proceeding to the group stages of the tournament.Being knocked out of the tourney is the last thing the Clever Boys coach Gavin Hunt will want as he was livid enough after being booted out of the domestic competition. This is the Students last chance this season to go further in a CAF tourney after they were dispatched by another Egyptian outfit Al Ahly from the Champions League.Hunt has admitted to not knowing much about their next opponent. I don t know anything about them. I don t have anything on them but we will see how it goes, Hunt said.-Sithembiso Dindi|sithembisod@thenewage.co.za
