SAA s R2.3bn bailout at the weekend is a further blow to the credibility of its board and management, with some analysts calculating this is likely to force Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba to present a deficit budget in February next year.Gigaba dropped a bombshell at the opening of the ANC policy conference on Friday, hinting that the country may need outside financial assistance . He did not mention them but observers took him to mean the World Bank or the IMF. With the country sinking into junk status and already in technical recession, soaring borrowing costs on public debt of R2.3 trillion is likely to skyrocket.Experts said Gigaba s tone was terrifying, as this could mean that the country is now broke . It s very scary if SA is joining the ranks of other broke countries who are relying on financial aid from the IMF or World Bank, said one analyst. President Jacob Zuma has admitted that the economy may not hit the forecast 1.3% growth target and urged political allies to discuss policies, including land redistribution, that could revamp the economy.Isaac Mashego, senior economist at Nedbank, said with slow economic growth, the government is going to have borrow more. This might mean going to multilateral institutions like the IMF. This is the worst case scenario, he said. Even with the latest R2.3bn tranche to settle its bill with Standard Chartered, SAA is nowhere near out of the woods, with Standard Bank and Absa owed R1bn each and R3bn owed to other creditors.The airline has around R9bn of debt which matured on Friday involving about six lenders, according to the Treasury, which last week told MPs it was in discussions to roll over the R9bn. The government said the funds provided to SAA had been sourced from the National Revenue Fund, which under law allows any minister to authorise the use of funds for expenditure of an exceptional nature. SAA already relies on government guarantees of about R20bn to keep it solvent. with Reuters|BERNARD SATHEKGE
