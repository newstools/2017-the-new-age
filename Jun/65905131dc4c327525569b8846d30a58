Premier Stan Mathabatha will join young people at the official June 16 commemoration rally at Ga-Chuene outside Polokwane on Friday.Provincial government spokesperson Phuti Seloba said the 40th anniversary activities of June 16 were being coordinated by the office of the premier s youth development directorate in partnership with the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) as well as units of various municipalities and provincial departments. The June youth programme will also focus on honouring young people from the province who succeeded in various fields, youth in institutions of higher learning, unemployed youth and those who are found in malls and shopping centres across the province, Seloba said.The commemoration comes at a time when most young people throughoutthe province are complaining about the high rate of unemployment and job losses.Some said that although they graduated from TVET colleges and universities it was still difficult for them to find jobs. Government departments take young people into learnership programmes or EPWP positions but not all of them get employment, Phuti Mpati said.He graduated with a management assistant diploma. I was 24 when I graduated and I did not have any money to go furtherand now here I am, getting older and jobless. I admit that government tries to play its part but big businesses are turning their backs on young black people, especially those from TVET colleges. Mathabatha is expected to echo some advice he shared during previous commemorations that although youth unemployment was a worldwide challenge.However, he says the provincial government had said some initiatives to help them.The premier is also expected to expand on the department of agriculture s current call to people, especially the youth and women, to apply forfunding in order to establish agricultural enterprises in crop and livestock farming in all five districts of the province.MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
