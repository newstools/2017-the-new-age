Olympic champion Wayde van Niekerk is well on course to compete successfully in the 400m and 200m at the London IAAF World Championships in August.Van Niekerk is expected to compete in his specialist 400m race, but is also eyeing gold in his latest challenge the 200m event. Competing in the double is not easy but the 400m world record-holder will look to use this golden opportunity to emulate Michael Johnson s feat of winning the 200m and 400m at the same World Championships. Running in the 200m at the Boston Adidas Boost event in the US in his first race overseas this season, Van Niekerk clocked 19.84 seconds, edging out American BeeJay Lee by 0.33 seconds in the five-lane race.It was not a world record but it meant a lot for South African athletics as it was a first by a one of our own at this meet. I ve still got a lot of work to do and have a lot of areas I need to look into Van Niekerk said. But it was a positive win for me today. It was challenging. To be honest I thought I did a 400. It was a bit tough. In another race, Akani Simbine did not achieve sub- 10 seconds, running in eighth. Even though he finished equal with a time of 10:21, Simbine was pipped by Keston Bledman of Trinidad and Tobago by one-thousandth of a second.Simbine reKGOMOTSO SETHUSHAcorded his slowest 100m of the season to date.
