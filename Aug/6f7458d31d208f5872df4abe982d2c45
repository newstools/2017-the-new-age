RESIDENTS of Botshabelo this week got the chance to raise concerns about what they said was a failing public health system.They told chairperson of the National Council of Provinces, Thandi Modise, along with Premier Ace Magashule and health MEC Butana Komphela, that shortages of staff and medicine at clinics and hospitals was taking its toll on the public.They asked members of the NCOP, who are on a week long visit to the Mangaung metro, to help improve services in health facilities.One resident Disebo Mokoena, 23, a mother of two said she wants Botshabelo Hospital to have facilities like Pelonomi and National hospitals because Botshabelo is a big place. It is not as big as Bloemfontein but can they please ensure that we have better equipment because when our children are admitted they are mostly transferred to Bloemfontein which is far and it cost us a lot as we have to travel everyday to Bloemfontein. Tankiso Motumi, 65, said they waited far too long in hospital queues. No matter how sick you are, nurses won t give you anything to help until you see the doctor. We wait the whole day before we can get help, he said.Mahlompho Litabe said they were concerned about the lack of staff. She said the staff shortages were affecting each person who visited the public facilities.Speaking to The New Age after the meeting, the NCOP chief whip Seeiso Mohai, said the week was still long and more discussions based on the issues especially staff shortages in the district hospitals would continue to arise.He said they would be visiting the district hospitals before having further discussion on other matters. The visit will give us clear idea of what is happening in the health facilities because we will be engaging with the staff and the management to see how we can tackle this very important issue of staff shortages, Mohai said.He said the visit would give them a picture of health status nationally and on how the province was improving in terms of addressing those issues.Mohai said they had received a report that the provincial health department was working with the provincial treasury to prioritise the budget towards core areas of the responsibility of the department.Based on the lack of medication, the chief whip said that during their visit in Xhariep district municipality there were lack of medication and water at the health facilities. But those problems has been addressed along with the others in the province, so basically people are well happy about the availability of the medication at the local clinics and it is there and there where there is concerns at the district hospitals but it will be addressed today, Mohai said.He said in the coming days various ministers would be available to field questions from the public. The purpose of the visit is to take Parliament to people, and the activities are under the theme Celebrating 20 years of the Democratic Constitution in the country and 20 years of existence of the NCOP. Komphela said one challenge they had encountered at the clinics was that the structures were too small to accommodate more nurses. Those clinic buildings are too small, one or two nurses you may find out that they are okay because when you employ more they will not have enough space to work, he said.BECKER SEMELAbeckers@thenewage.co.za
