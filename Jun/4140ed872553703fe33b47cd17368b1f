Former Home Affairs minister Malusi Gigaba will still be called to appear before a parliamentary committee to explain how he had applied his mind in granting citizenship to Gupta family members.Gigaba and his successor Hlengiwe Mkhize were due to have attended the home affairs portfolio committee yesterday. But they sent apologies.Yesterday s meeting also resolved that a letter released on social media and which the EFF claimed was an official Home Affairs document should be investigated.This was after Home Affairs director-general Mkuseli Apleni produced a copy of a letter which he said was the authentic one.Parliamentarians were upset by the department s omission through Gigaba, when he was still minister of Home Affairs, to inform the National Assembly of a group of 18 families who had become naturalised South Africans. This, they said, was a breach of the law.However, ANC MP Don Gumede called this a matter of oversight and negligence rather than a corrupt act. Four members of the Gupta family are in this group, excluding Ajay Gupta, who is still an Indian citizen.But his mother, Angoori, wife Shivani Gupta and their two sons, Suraya and Kamal, were naturalised after an appeal to Gigaba.Apleni said those who had been naturalised could not lose their status because the department had failed to account to Parliament, adding that such an action could be challenged in court.Also, he said, Gigaba s predecessors Naledi Pandor and Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma had also on occasion not informed Parliament about naturalisations.Apleni said the committee had turned down the Gupta s initial application because they had not met the requirements.However, they had looked into the matter again after the family had appealed to Gigaba.Apleni said he was part of the group of senior Home Affairs officials who had advised Gigaba on the appeal. In a bureaucracy, no minister will just sit in a corner and write a letter. A minister is advised by his or her lieutenants, which in this case the last one is the director-general, Apleni said.He was asked by DA chief whip John Steenhuisen if he had at any time received gifts from the Gupta family.He said: I ve never been. I never had any business with them. I ve never had any gifts from them. He could not directly answer a question if the four members of the Gupta family that had been naturalised had renounced their Indian citizenship.But he said the Indian consulate had required them to hand in their Indian passports.The Gupta family was not in possession of official South African passports, which were only to be used by government officials.Others who had been naturalised he said included Janusz Waluz, who had assassinated Chris Hani.DENNIS CRUYWAGENnews@thenewage.co.za
