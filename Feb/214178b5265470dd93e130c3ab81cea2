France&#8217;s Michelin, one of the world&#8217;s biggest tyre makers, on Tuesday reported a sharp rise in net profit for 2016 even as sales dropped partly on pound weakness following last year&#8217;s Brexit vote.Net profit increased by 43 percent to 1.7 billion euros ($1.8 billion) on sales of 21 billion euros, down 1.4 percent.The drop in sales was partly due to weakness in the pound after Britain&#8217;s vote to leave the European Union as sales generated in sterling resulted in fewer euros, the company&#8217;s reporting currency.Commodity prices also weighed on sales, Michelin said.But the tyre maker, in the global top three with Bridgestone and Goodyear, managed a 2.1-percent rise volume sales, outperforming the overall market, Michelin said.Combined with a favourable product mix and an exceptional gain this resulted in a much better bottom line.&#8220;The 2016 results show clear progress compared with the previous year,&#8221; CEO Jean-Dominique Senard said.Michelin met all its annual targets, including &#8220;very significant&#8221; cash flow.Debt fell and Michelin&#8217;s operating margin rose.The results &#8220;make us extremely confident about the future,&#8221; Senard told reporters.He said the Brexit fallout was having a &#8220;complex&#8221; impact on Michelin&#8217;s performance, but had so far been &#8220;limited overall.&#8221;He said Michelin raised its tyre prices in Britain to compensate for the pound&#8217;s weakness. At the same time Michelin&#8217;s factory in Scotland was enjoying a competitive advantage from the weaker currency&#8217;s impact on export prices.&#8221;It is too early to draw definitive conclusions,&#8221;Senard said.-AFP
