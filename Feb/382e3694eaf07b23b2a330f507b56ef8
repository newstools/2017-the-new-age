She was declared a hostile witness after her testimony contradicted her previous statement where she alleged that her boyfriend told her of Panayiotou&#8217;s plans to kill his wife.In her statement she also said that she counted the money that was allegedly meant to pay alleged triggerman Sizwe Vumazonke. Vumazonke has since passed away. However in court Breakfast said the money was meant for Siyoni s gym renovations. Siyoni has since turned state witness. Defence lawyers Terry Price and Peter Daubermann both felt that the state was trying to intimidate witnesses. I think it appauling that a witness who has chosen not to tell the state everything has now been locked up. It is a flagrant intimidation if witnesses. We have had 4 or 5 witnesses who have deviated and they have not been arrested, said Price. Christopher Panayiotou is accused of being the mastermind behind his wife Jayde s kidnapping and murder, this according to information given to the police by alleged accomplice turned state witness Luthando Siyoni, who was also Panayiotou s employee.
