It has taken some convincing to get people to believe that South African rapper Riky Rick, is a bonafide fashion icon.Even fans of the awardwinning star have shown little to no interest in the rapper s fashion sense.However, after a photograph of the rapper clad in a brown winter coat, black shoes with a The Union Jack British colours painted on the upper part of the shoe and holding a matching Gucci bag made a number of world renowned publications, the rapper could be on his way to international fashion stardom.The iconic picture was taken by award-winning photographer Acielle Styledumonde, at the recent Paris Fashion Week.The picture has since been endorsed by more than a dozen international publications among them Vogue, The NewYork Times, Vogue Paris, and British Vogue.On hearing the news, Riky Rick posted: The day you get over the fear of being judged is the same day the world will open up ALL its doors for you.There is nothing that can hold back a positive attitude. Be Strong. Stay Shining. Enjoy the Journey. This also resulted in all round praise for the Belgium Acielle who has been described as having a great editorial level street style photography by many of the fashion editors.With this remarkable feat happening at the start of the new year, the Durban born rapper might have finally silenced his fashion critics.SIYABONGA SITHOLE
