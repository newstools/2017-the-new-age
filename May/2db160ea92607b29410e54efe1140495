Residents of Leukama village outside Polokwane where three ANC Women s League members were killed in an accident on Saturday have demanded traffic calmers to put the brakes on wayward drivers.Villagers blocked the R567 road briefly early this week calling for the immediate construction of speed bumps.They said the latest deaths and injuries could have been prevented had authorities listened to their earlier pleas for traffic calmers on the road.Residents told Transport Minister Joe Maswanganyi, who visited the bereaved families, that he must ensure speed bumps and pedestrian crossings were erected urgently to avert more loss of lives and injuries.The three activists, Nora Koenaite, Violet Veronica Ledwaba and Mavis Mmonoa, were killed when a speeding bakkie ploughed into them, injuring two other women.They were among a group of women waiting for transport to attend the dumela moagisane event which was addressed by the ANCWL president Bathabile Dlamini at Segopje in the Ga-Mamabolo area.ANCWL provincial spokesperson Christina Mohale yesterday told The New Age that a delegation of the league s Peter Mokaba region was in consultation with affected families to plan for the funerals. Details of how and where these comrades will be buried will obviously emerge after agreements with the affected families. We are also in discussion with traditional leaders, Mohale said.Meanwhile, the driver of the vehicle which allegedly crushed the women to death appeared in the Seshego Magistrate s Court on charges of culpable homicide and drunken driving on Monday.Simon Phukubje, 53, was released on R1000 bail and the case was postponed to July 27 for further investigation, police spokesperson Lt-Col Moatshe Ngoepe said.MONTSHO MATLALAmontshom@thenewage.co.za
