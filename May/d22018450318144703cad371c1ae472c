The hearings are expected to last until May 23.Safa legal officer Tebogo Motlanthe disclosed this week that disputed cases would be settled this week: We have set aside the coming week to finalise most of the DC cases so that we don t hold up playoffs for long, Motlanthe said in a statement.The 2016/2017 season heads towards the end with several provincial champions expected to be determined through the legal route , and these include Gauteng, Limpopo, Eastern Cape and North West.Expected to be dealt with at the DC on Friday is a matter involving Molemole in which the team claims that although Bellevue Winners Park FC have had their dogged points, the points had not been deducted from the offending team.If Bellevue wins its appeal and Dolphins loses, then Bellevue will be crowned the Limpopo champions. On another matter, Dolphins will be confirmed provincial champions if they win their case against Giyani Hotspurs. In Gauteng, Vaal Professionals have lodged a complaint of alleged corruption against Maccabi . In this regard, Maccabi FC may lose their status as champion if the case does not go in their favour. The case is expected be heard on May 20 and 21.Meanwhile, in the North West whoever wins the disputed cases involving Polokwane City Rovers and Buya Musuthu, is likely to win the provincial league. -TNA Reporter
