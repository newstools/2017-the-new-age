Owen da Gama will be involved in the selection of the next Bafana Bafana squad but that is likely to be his last association with the national team. The arrival of Stuart Baxter as team head coach will probably signal the end of a two-and-ahalf-year association Da Gama has had with Bafana, having being part of Shakes Mashaba’s technical team. The two forged a new era of a youngish team, which qualified for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations finals. Baxter said he would work with the current assistants, including Thabo Senong and goalkeeper coach Lucky Shiburi, for the opening 2019 Afcon qualifier against Nigeria next month. But the Brit is understood to be keen on bringing his own technical team and not inheriting his predecessor’s staff. Even though he has denied reports he was bringing his son as part of the deal with Safa, Baxter is expected to bring new faces to the Bafana setup. He gave the biggest hint that Da Gama, Senong and Shiburi would be offloaded as he embarked on the daunting task of charting a new path for the team, which has hugely underperformed in international tournaments and hasn’t qualified for any for major competitions recently. “There won’t be many changes at the moment because the changes I will make need to be done after I have seen the setup,” Baxter said. “I know a lot of the people who are in the setup and I know I can work with them in the short term. “I will make recommendations and then it’s up to the association to make the bigger decisions. “I would bring in people whose opinions I respect.” To prepare for the crunch date with the Super Eagles, Baxter will receive all the team materials, which includes the list of players who have played in recent national team matches, video analyses and site inspection report in Nigeria, compiled by Bafana team manager Barney Kujane. Baxter, who previously coached Bafana from May 2004 to November 2005, will announce his squad on May 25. -KGOMOTSO SETHUSHA|kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
