Lamborghini plans to release hybrid supercars in the near future, chairman and CEO Stefano Domenicali told AFP on Tuesday. The Italian supercar manufacturer says the first of its hybrid vehicles will be its new Sports Utility Vehicle, the URUS, unveiled on Monday and dubbed by the brand the world’s first super-SUV. “Hybridization is the natural step in the growth of our brand… The URUS, in its second engine, will be a hybrid. And the new super sports car projects will be,” he said. The URUS will reach a top speed of 305 kph (190 mph), can go from zero to 100 kph in 3.6 seconds and brake from 100 kph to zero in 33.7 metres, company officials said. “The objective is to maintain a balance between traditional values and the technology of the future,” said Domenicali, while acknowledging that electric cars were “a clear trend in the automotive world”. The announcement by Lamborghini comes as carmakers rush to add electric vehicles to their offerings and as countries make efforts to curb carbon emissions. Asked about the prospect of the car manufacturer entering Formula 1 — after F1 director Ross Brawn said he would like to get Lamborghini and other manufacturers involved — Domenicali said the answer was “no”. “We have to concentrate on priority investments so that Lamborghini can grow. We shall watch F1 races on the television!” -AFP
