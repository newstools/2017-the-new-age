A SENIOR Gauteng politician, who is out on parole, stands accused of committing statutory rape. A whistle-blower told The New Age yesterday the politician s affair with a 15-year-old minor started last year while campaigning during the 2016 local government elections in Umzimkhulu, KwaZulu-Natal.The whistle-blower said a letter was sent to the politician s organisation in February after the girl confessed. The letter, which is in the possession of The New Age, outlined shocking details of the incident. Members of the politician s political party said they decided to act because they could not continue to turn a blind eye. Upon knowing about the incident, we expected leadership to act, but they swept the letter under the carpet with the help of a social worker. We opened a case of statutory rape at the Roodepoort police station in March, one member said. Despite a case being registered, the whistle-blower said the alleged perpetrator was not arrested. Gauteng police spokesperson Col Lungelo Dlamini said police would check on the case today. I need to check the case before commenting further, Dlamini said. When confronted yesterday, the 52-year-old politician reacted angrily and challenged the family to have him arrested. Let those who accuse me of statutory rape open a case. I am not going to answer any questions, he said. He was sentenced to a 15-year jail term in 2001 for robbery and heists. I did not violate my parole, I do not understand how it is your business. You called about the statutory rape, not my parole. Don t mix the two issues. The whistle-blower also accused the minor s mother of accepting money to block further investigations into the case. The mother received R10000 from the politician. She does not care. On February 22, the girl attempted suicide. This man has brought sorrow to her family, the whistle-blower said.ntombin@thenewage.co.za-Ntombi Nkosi
