The Joburg leg of the Mercedes Fashion Week Spring Summer Collection at the Mall of Africa in Midrand from August 17 to 19 wrapped up in spectacular fashion on Saturday. Former public protector Thuli Madonsela and ex-DA parliamentary leader Lindiwe Mazibuko were among a list of women dressed in white T-shirts that read: We should all be feminists as they walked the runway in support of feminism on the last day of the fashion show.The two had members of the audience bemused when they joined celebrities, among them actress and television presenter Boity Thulo, actress Kgomotso Christopher, rapper Yung Swiss, Thembi Seete and Top Billing presenter Ayanda Thabethe, as part of designer Stefenia Morland s bold fashion show. The printed T-shirts were also handed to members of the audience to highlight the plight of women in South Africa.The unsuspecting audience was also left speechless when an Italian-inspired design and luxury menswear brand showcased its first ever women s wear.Instead of male models walking the catwalk, the fashion brand launched its Fabiani collection featuring an all-women range dominated by intricate beadwork, high voltage metallics and bold silk chiffons, designed by leading South African fashion designer Warrick Gautier.Fabiani s marketing manager Lyle Paul said Gautier s collection brought African flair to the luxury brand. We were inspired by the need in the South African market for luxury African clothing tailored for powerful, successful, progressive and sophisticated women. We couldn t be more thrilled to be collaborating with local design talent such as Warrick, as a uniquely African aesthetic is central to this collection, Paul said.Over the years, Gautier has collaborated with brands such as Chloe and Louis Vuitton.The three-day fashion show kicked off on Thursday with the likes of businesswoman Carol Bouwer, television presenters Penny Lebyane and Dineo Ranaka, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba s wife Norma Gigaba and Deputy Agriculture Minister Bheki Cele s wife Thembeka Ngcobo, joining in to witness leading South Africa brands strut their stuff on the first day.The first show kicked off with Kluk CDGT on the runway showcasing Malcolm Kluk and Christiaan Gabri l du Toit s love for a bold, eclectic andedgy approach to fashion fused with stylish craftsmanship for all types of women.Other brands that showcased included David Tlale, Gavin Rajah, Thula Sindi, , Khosi Nkosi, KL Tsotetsi, Leigh Schubert, Marianne Fassler, Orapeleng Modulte Style Avenue, Quiteria and George and Ruff Tung.SIYABONGA SITHOLEsiyabongas@thenewage.co.za
