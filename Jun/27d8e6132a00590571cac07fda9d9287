If anyone doubts that the Springboks are on an upward trajectory, then the fact that Allister Coetzee s men will be gunning for a series whitewash over France tomorrow at Ellis Park at 5pm should be convincing enough.Sure, this is France and not New Zealand, England, Australia or even Argentina, who gave the Boks a tough time last year.But as they gear up for the third and final Test, the Boks will be out to finish the series with another indicator that their problems of 2016 are behind them.Not only is there confidence in their performances but also in Coetzee continuing to trust young players, this week handing Ruan Dreyer his debut at tight-head prop in place of suspended Frans Malhebe.There is also a start at openside flanker for Jean-Luc du Preez, while Francois Hougaard will start in a Bok jersey for the first time this year with Ross Cronje concussed.While Coetzee has decided to keep faith in wings Cournall Skosan and Raymond Rhule, despite a bad try scoring return, the return of Jesse Kriel in place of Lionel Mapoe tells a story of a team that believes it is finding some rhythm.And one can t blame them after Siya Kolisi s monstrous performance in Durban, where he scored a try and set up Elton Jantjies for another, Coetzee has opted not to fix what is not broken. I said earlier in the week that we would keep changes in the starting team to the minimum because we have huge respect for this powerful French side. The inclusion of Ruan in the starting team gives us an important opportunity to build capacity in the tight-head position. This is a very important position and it is great to have players such as Coenie Oosthuizen and Steven Kitshoff coming off the bench as a combination, while Ruan will start next to his Lions hooker in Malcolm Marx, Coetzee said. Jesse had an outstanding game in the first match and he really combined well with Jan Serfontein in the midfield before he was forced to leave the field. The selection of the centre pairing was really a tough task and Lionel is perhaps unlucky to lose out on the match 23. He played well in Durban but Jesse was also very good next to Jan Serfontein in Pretoria and my decision is based on developing combinations. France coach Guy Noves has made three changes to his side, bringing in Jules Plisson, Brice Dulin and Nans Ducuing.mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
