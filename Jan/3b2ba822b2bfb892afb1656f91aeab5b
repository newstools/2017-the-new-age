Cricket South Africa (csa) chief executive Haroon Lorgat feels they did not get their expected return on the investment the organisation made in the development of departing Proteas duo Kyle Abbott and Rilee Rossouw.Abbott and Rossouw have both quit the national team to play county cricket in England in the upcoming season. Both have Kolpak contracts with Hampshire which preclude them from playing for South Africa, with Abbott having signed for four years and Rossouw for three. Lorgat said they had invested a lot on these players, especially Rossouw. We invest huge sums of money in chosen individuals. By way of example, Rilee has spent a lengthy period on the injury list while we spared no expense in providing him with the best medical support and now we are not getting our return. It is a sad day for us, Lorgat said. Our Protea players are among the top five percent of earners in our country. Abbott, 29, said his decision was difficult to make but feels he has made the right decision for his future. At the end of the day it s the right decision for me. It s four years of financial security. I don t want to sit in 12 months time when everyone is fit, wearing a reserve player s bib yet again. Abbott was at the centre of a major controversy when he was excluded from South Africa s team for the semifinal of the 2015 World Cup against New Zealand after team management were reminded of cricket s transformation targets. I m at peace with that, he said. It was a very difficult time, not only for me but for the team and for Cricket South Africa. I think it took us a while to get over that, as recently as the New Zealand Test series last August. Since then, not only has the team turned around, but the issues the team had with various issues regarding selection, whatever, have been addressed and the national team and Cricket South Africa are on the right path.
