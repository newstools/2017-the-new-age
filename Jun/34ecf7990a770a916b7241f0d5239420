Defending CAF Champions League champions Mamelodi Sundowns hoped to secure a positive result against Tunisian giants Esperance in South Africa ahead of the return fixture in Tunis.The opposite prevailed in Atteridgeville, forcing Pitso Mosimane s men to hunt for a victory by any means necessary in the return clash at the Stade Olympia in Tunis on Wednesday. Having watched the 2-1 loss from the stands, Anthony Laffor, who has been Sundowns super sub in the Champions League, is back from injury and ready to help Sundowns secure a spot in the knockout stages.With each team having played three matches, the Brazilians are third in Group C with four points. Esperance top the group with seven points, while St. George from Ethiopia are second with five points. AS Vita of the Democratic Republic of Congo are bottom with no points. All of a sudden, qualifying from the group looks a difficult task for Sundowns, with Laffor recognising the importance of an away victory in Tunis. The conditions are okay. It is hot here but better than other African countries we have been to. We cannot complain. The game on Wednesday will be important. We have to win to be top in our group. We are not here to draw. A win is the only thing we want, Laffor said. They are a good side. I watched the game from the stands. Technically, they are good, but we can break them. We had chances that we did not capitalise on. I hope we will be able to finish off our chances this time around. They are not extraordinary. We are looking at the overall picture, but the most important match is on Wednesday. Sundowns hopes will rest on the shoulders of Themba Zwane, who was in fine form when Sundowns beat AS Vita away and Percy Tau, who scored for Bafana Bafana away in Nigeria.-MMASEKEPE MATSEBANE|mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
