Former DA leader Tony Leon would have stepped down had he been in Premier Helen Zille’s shoes if he had been suspended by the party’s federal executive council.  Leon said this in an interview with Sifiso Mahlangu, anchor for the ANN7’s Straight Talk, this amid the growing row and distance between Zille and the party’s leader, Mmusi Maimane, over her suspension.  “At that point I would have said I have served the country and my people and that is enough. I don’t want to distract myself from the core mission of a party I helped build up,” Leon said in an interview.  “It is a sad moment for her, the party and the country,” continued Leon, who himself had been the DA leader since the party’s inception before being succeeded by Zille.  Leon argued that the opposition should be more focused on winning the votes against the governing party “instead of scoring own goals against itself”.  “If the governing party is currently at its weakest point but the opposition is distracted and divided over a row about colonialism, you have to say, that has to be stopped,” he said.  Zille has until today to convince the DA federal executive council why she should not be suspended.  Maimane announced her suspension at the weekend, but Zille countered by pointing out to procedural flaw which had denied her the opportunity to make a representation before a decision to suspend could be made.  Leon said he did not believe that Zille is a racist. However, Leon believes that Zille  handled the matter in a manner that caused the saga to drag on unnecessarily.  Zille is to face a DA disciplinary in front of a three-person panel headed by lawyer Jurie Moolman in connection with the seemingly pro-colonialism tweets she tweeted after returning from Singapore in March.  -TNA Reporter
