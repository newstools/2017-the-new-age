The ANC Youth League in KwaZulu-Natal has promised to take action against Pravin Gordhan for, what it calls, mobilising society against the ANC.The league on Monday hosted a press briefing during which they affirmed their support for newly-appointed Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba following Friday s cabinet reshuffle.&#8220;Pravin is mobilising people against the ANC and we will not sit and watch. We will mobilise people to support the ANC and reshuffle,&#8221; said Youth League provincial chairperson Kwazi Mshengu.During a press conference on Friday, Gordhan urged South Africans who were displeased with the cabinet reshuffle to &#8220;organise&#8221; en masse.Gordhan&#8217;s call has led to mass protests and the sprouting of a #BlackMonday protests.The KZN Youth League have challenged Gordhan and his former Deputy Mcebisi Jonas to return back to their respective ANC branches if they want to influence the policies of the party.&#8220;We invite Pravin to come mobilise here in his hometown. He can&#8217;t mobilise and he won&#8217;t see the light of day in this province,&#8221; said Mshengu.The League added that while they were pleased with President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s decision to replace Pravin Gordhan, a change of personnel without change of policy would not help.Mshengu criticised Gordhan&#8217;s tenure at the helm of National Treasury for being &#8220;anti-transformation&#8221;.&#8220;It s public knowledge that Mr Gordhan has never been in support of radical transformation through the ANC and thus had to leave because he elevated white monopoly capital and undermined the sitting president of the country,&#8221; said Mshengu.The KZN Youth League on Monday also criticised members of the ANC top 6 for publicly speaking out against President Zuma&#8217;s cabinet reshuffle.Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, secretary-general Gwede Mantashe and treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize have all voiced their criticism.&#8220;Gwede Mantashe and his friends have stooped to their lowest by publicly slamming the reshuffle. He&#8217;s lying saying that there was no consultation.&#8221;&#8220;We now know that the President consulted them (ANC top brass) and we also know that the president spoke to the officials before announcing the reshuffle. The leaderships difference in views does not mean that the president should not take a decision,&#8221; said Mshengu.ANC NEC member Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, who was closing the eThekwini ANC Women s League conference yesterday, said that the ongoing public dissent by some ANC leaders the reshuffle was unfortunate and should have been avoided.The ANC top six is scheduled on Monday to hold a meeting followed by the party s national working committee session.-TNA Reporter
