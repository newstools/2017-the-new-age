President Jacob Zuma met Finance and Social Development ministers on Saturday in an attempt to resolve the grants crisis.This urgent meeting came as the Department of Social Development&#8217;s director-general Zane Dangor resigned citing differences of opinion between himself and the Social Development minister Bathabile Dlamini.In a statement, the President said he was of the view that matters were solvable . He has directed the two Ministers to mandate their technical teams to work on the outstanding issues in order to ensure that social grant beneficiaries receive their grants on the 1st of April, the statement read.Dlamini is due to address media on Sunday.The meeting and resignation came as Sassa and Cash Paymaster Services (CPS) apparently brokered an agreement for CPS to continue paying the grants beyond March 31. There had been widespread concern that the recipients of 17 million grants would not receive their money on April 1.Dangor told SAFM he believed more could have been done to deal with the grants issue and is quoted as saying he particularly disagreements on Sassa s obligation in relation to the Constitutional Court .The department also announced that it had withdrawn its application to the Constitutional Court. The Concourt in 2013 declared the CPS contract to be invalid but allowed it to continue in order to facilitate the payments of 17 million grants another contract was negotiated.The department and Sassa will nevertheless be obliged to return to the Concourt as Black Sash, a long-time critic of CPS, has taken the matter to the court to review the process.Black Sash has said it recognised that CPS was the only solution in the interim but wants the court to ensure that the recipients are protected.Last week the Dlamini did not appear before the Parliamentary committee on finance (Scopa) and Dangor also absented himself on the first day and cut his report back short on the second. The minister and DG are due this week to report to Cabinet on the payment of social grants.Zuma has asked that the Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and Dlamini keep him updated on the progress in resolving the crisis.Dlamini s department and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa have been at pains to reassure the public that the grants would be paid on April 1, nevertheless, there has been widespread criticism because the Concourt declared the CPS contract invalid in 2014 and no solution had been found since then. It s a breakdown in the relationship between myself and minister following disagreements on the management of the processes on paying the grants on 1 April,&#8221; Dangor was quoted as saying.Cecilia Russell
