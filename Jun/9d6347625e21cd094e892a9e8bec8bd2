The Congress of South African Students (Cosas) has condemned a statement by its greater Johannesburg region&#8217;s in which it had called for the burning down of private schools.The statement reportedly surfaced on social networks yesterday. It called for its members to burnt down and vandalise all private schools.Cosas provincial chairperson Thabang Mahlomuza today distanced the organisation from such views, condemning it. We are not calling for the burning of those schools. We are simply saying that there must be an intervention programme which will ensure that township students must be taken to the schools and have access and be in the perimeters of those facilities,&#8221;Mahlomuza said.He said Cosas would take steps to ensure that &#8220;such a misleading message is never communicated&#8221;.&#8220;We will advise the regional executive committee of Cosas in Johannesburg to discuss with us before they issue statements,&#8221; Mahlomuza said.-TNA Reporter &nbsp;
