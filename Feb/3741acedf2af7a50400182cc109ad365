The African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) has joined the chorus calling for David Makhura to step down as the Premier of the province.Their call comes after the health ombudsman s findings following investigations into circumstances surrounding the deaths of 94 mentally ill patients.&#8220;We regard those findings as a true reflection of the careless, negligent and poor leadership of not only the Gauteng Provincial Department of Health led by the disgraceful MEC Qedani Mahlangu but the entire Leadership of the Gauteng Provincial Government led by Premier David Makhura who allowed the disgraced MEC to arrogantly continue misleading the people of Gauteng and families of the victims,&#8221; ANCYL in Gauteng said.&#8220;The ANC Youth League in Gauteng further calls for the immediate resignation of the Premier whose administration has presided over the cruel and untimely deaths of innocent patients. The Premier has 14 Working days to hand over his resignation failing which we will mobilize the entire membership of the ANC Youth League in the Province to occupy the office of the Premier until he accedes to our demands,&#8221; the Youth League said in a statement.The Youth League has also urged the provincial government to lay charges against former MEC of Health Qedani Mahlangu who resigned on Tuesday Night.The ANCYL also called for the provincial mother body to suspend the former MEC s membership from the organisation, adding that they will be laying a criminal charge against Mahlangu. In this note we also call upon the ANC provincial executive Committee of the ANC consistent with how other cases were dealt in wherein the ANC was brought into disrepute to immediately suspend the membership of the disgraced MEC of Health and take her through a disciplinary committee, ANCYL said.Meanwhile the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) echoed the same sentiments calling for the provincial government to lay criminal charges against the former Health MEC.EFF s spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said patients died after they were moved from Life Esidimeni which was owned by a private healthcare provider to unregistered non-governmental organisations (NGOs). We call on Makhura s government to all step down as this is direct consequence of their incompetence. Criminalising Qedani Mahlangu alone, who served at the pleasure of the premier, is wrong. In full recognition of this massacre, Makhura must step down,&#8221; Ndlozi added.However, the Progressive Youth Alliance (PYA) called for the matter to be investigated thoroughly and all those involved to be brought to book. The PYA in Gauteng calls for further and thorough investigations into the tragedy so as to ensure that all those involved in the deaths of the more than 94 patients are brought to book, PYA said in a statement.The PYA took a swipe at health officials saying they were the ones who were in charge of the day to day running of the department so they needed to answer as to why the death of 94 patients occurred on their watch.&#8220;The report implicates officials who are responsible for daily operations of the department whose conduct contributed directly to the deaths of 94 patients and that disciplinary proceedings be instituted for gross misconduct and/or incompetence in compliance with Disciplinary Code and procedure applicable to SMS members in the public service.We recognise and welcome the bold steps taken by the Gauteng government regarding the remedial recommendations in line with the Ombudsman findings and urge the administration to act decisively within the timeframe provided,&#8221; PYA Reiterated.The alliance further applauded Mahlangu&#8217;s move to resign as the MEC adding that it showed good leadership. We commend Cde Qedani Mahlangu for doing the right thing in line with resolutions of the congress movement on integrity and ethics. Her actions should be emulated in all of spheres of government where responsibility and accountability must be taken by public servants as per the duties assigned to them, PYA said.94 mentally ill patients from Life Esidemeni died: Prof Makgoba-Sipho Jack
