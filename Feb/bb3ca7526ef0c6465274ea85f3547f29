The majority of young people aged 20-34 have a higher level of education than their parents according to a report on Education Enrolment and Achievement for 2016 released by Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) yesterday.The study found that close to 70% of those who had completed secondary schooling in the 20-34 group, were first-generation high-school graduates.Similarly, more than over 70% of those who completed post-secondary education were first-generation post-secondary qualification holders. The data shows the higher the parent s education level, the more likely the children are to achieve upward educational mobility. Among children aged 20-34 who had completed a post-secondary qualification, 51% had parents with some or completed secondary schooling, the report said. While most white children with post-secondary qualifications also had parents with similar qualifications (56%), inter-generational transmission of similar qualifications was achieved by 28% coloureds, 27% Indians and 24% black Africans. The largest escalation in inter-generational mobility was observed among black Africans, with 76% of those who completed a post-secondary education having achieved a higher education level than their parents. South African households on average spent R2531 yearly in 2014-15 on education, accounting for 2.45% of total household expenditure.White-headed households spent three times as much on education compared to the national average, while Indian/Asian and coloured-headed households spent approximately R6731 and R3236, respectively.In 2015, black African-headed households had the lowest average annual expenditure at R1656, and were the only households to spend less than the national average of R2531 per annum.In 2016, close to 17% of the total 3.6 million children aged 0-2 were attending an early learning programme.The number of 15 year olds and older completing Grade 12 and higher education has been rising with the number of pupils aged 15 years and older who completed matric increasing from 3.7.-LILLIAN SELAPISA
