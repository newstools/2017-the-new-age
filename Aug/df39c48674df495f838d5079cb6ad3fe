The National Executive Committee member Bheki Cele has advice the ANC to restore the unity of the organization or risk losing the upcoming national election.Cele told delegates in Port Shepstone that the ANC didn t belong to anyone and it was instead a movement of the people. If this unity doesn t come, kiss my vote goodbye in 2019. The ANC does not belong to anyone, he said.Cele was speaking at a Cadres Forum in Port Shepstone on the south coast of KwaZulu-Natal. The forum was expected to be addressed by the Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa.He also said he supported the idea of having a woman president in the country but insisted that all candidates should be given a chance as it is not right that only one candidate is being pushed.Cele urged members of the ANC in the Port Shepstone Region to be united pending the court case that is currently in Pietermaritzburg high court over the validity of the conference which saw Sihle Zikalala emerged as the provincial chairperson.The former police commissioner said it was embarrassing that the courts were now arbitrated over internal party politics.-Sipho Jack&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
