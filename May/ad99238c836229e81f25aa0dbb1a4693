The web of influence of Bitz Technologies, trading as Abacus Advisory the company which has been exposed in a Treasury internal audit has been laid bare. But it is only one of several companies which have been severely criticised in an internal audit report.This week Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba said the R145m five-year project to kickstart the government s ambitious IFMS project was under investigation.An Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) Payments Review Report by internal auditors was handed to former Treasury DG Lungisa Fuzile in March last year. Since then no action has been taken, sources told ANN7.The report refers to grave transgressions of financial management processes and lack of controls in the setting up of the project management office (PMO) and highlights of the 54 findings that were identified, 49 were considered to be catastrophic . The audit opinion expressed therefore concluded that controls in this environment are inefficient and ineffective rendering this control environment inadequate (underlined and in bold), the report reads.Key findings including that the lack of budgeting meant that 48% of the five-year budget was spent in 17 months.These payments include R7.7m to Apex Advisory Services of its R35m contract with no deliverables.KPMG was paid R50,5m of its R76,5m contract or 66.01% with serious backlogs in deliverables.Bitz was paid R12,3m of this R28,2 m contract or 43.6%.ANN7 is in possession of the contracts which were signed by Treasury s former accountant-general Michael Sass and Abacus managing partner Mohamed Cassim, who also served as a consultant in Fuzile s office.The first contract was for R39m, when it was discovered that there was a R11m discrepancy, the contract was renegotiated for R28m, but this did not take into account that the company had already been paid R5,8m.The damning audit report warns Treasury that the due to the blunders it may end up overpaying Bitz by more than R12m.The lack of oversight did not stop with Bitz and in its report on KPMG the auditors pointed out that more than R2.5m was paid out to KPMG s for a probity services 1 report without a service level agreement for their role the setting up and management the government s critical IMFS programme.The report found in addition payments made on August 31, 2015 there was no evidence of deliverables .IFMS was a project first cleared in 2005 for the integration across national and provincial government of supply chain, human resources, financial, payroll and business intelligence management.The audit report said the impact of the lack of financial controls in the KPMG case was catastrophic a technical term used by auditors to suggest there was inadequate management of the financial management processes which could result in the National Treasury s brand and reputation being brought into disrepute.It pointed out for example that the fact that 78.56% of the budget had been spent in less than two years with no approved deliverables or quality assurance function in place was highly problematic.The auditors were also concerned that meant that there was little or no control over the budget. Management should ensure that no further payments are made to service provider unless value for money can be determined by the independent quality assurance function for deliverables produced to date, the report dryly comments &#8211; indicating once again that most of the contract value had been paid out without any evidence that it had achieved approved deliverables.The fact that there were no deliverables indicated a lack of cost and project management. The expenditure was potentially fruitless and wasteful expenditure and it was considered to be irregular and unauthorised expenditure, the internal audit report said.It recommended that in order to fix these transgressions there should be regular reconciliations on expenditure, this should be tracked against deliverables to prevent exhausting total budget without meeting the contract requirements.In addition, it said that all IFMS payments going forward should only be approved after quality sign-off on deliverables by independent quality monitors.The internal auditors did not accept the IFMS Project Management Office s explanation that the probity reports would not form part of evidence pack due to sensitivity .Instead, the report said: Any withholding of information from internal audit limits the scope of the audit in terms of the standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, more so as this review was commissioned by the audit committee.
