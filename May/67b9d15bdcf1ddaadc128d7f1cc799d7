PITSO Mosimane says he s certain Mamelodi Sundowns won t be losing yet another captain. There are fears among Sundowns faithful that Hlompho Kekana is leaving as he is dragging his feet to sign a new contract. His deal runs out at the end of next month.In the off-season, Sundowns lost skipper Ramahlwe Mphahlele to Kaizer Chiefs after the defender failed to agree on new terms. But the Sundowns coach expressed no fear that Kekana would follow suit. He suggested Kekana would not be swayed by money over the prestige of playing for the African champions. I am not worried about Hlompho, really. If he were to leave he will go overseas. Where is he going? Does he want to play Champions League or not? You can choose to go to a team that doesn t play Champions League, it s up to him. Champions League is big. It takes you to the World Cup and gives you a position in Bafana Bafana, so you choose what you want. And we look after our players. I think you know what happens with prize money when win win any cup. How many trophies did we win last season? And the president gives us all the money. I think anyone should think about it when you want to cross the floor because of a salary, only because someone pays R10 000 more. It s difficult to outbid Sundowns because it s not about money but prestige. Since assuming the captain s role, Kekana failed to lead Sundowns to MTN8 glory but led the team to clinch the CAF Super Cup. Mosimane appears certain the former SuperSport United, Black Leopards and Celtic hard man is set to lead Downs to the League championship.news@thenewage.co.za-Linda Ximba
