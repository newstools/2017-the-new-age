PLATINUM Stars caretaker coach Willem Jackson said their leaking defence has been the cause of their struggles in the CAF Confederation Cup.Stars, who are bottom of Group C, are one of two teams in the Confederation Cup with the worst defence this season. Dikwena and Group D s CF Mounana of Gabon have both conceded the most goals, having let in nine from four outings. Jackson has been in charge of the club since the sacking of Cavin Johnson early this month.The former defender hopes to have fixed the problem by the time Dikwena visit top of the table MC Alger on Friday in Algeria. Last week, the Phokeng-based outfit threw away a 1-0 lead at home against CS Sfaxien and ended up sharing the spoils with the Tunisian side. We just had a slight problem in defence. We lost a little bit of concentration and that s why we conceded that goal, Jackson said. Overall the guys played well. They attacked a lot. You could see that they were more positive going forward. We really hoped that we could get all the three points but we had to be satisfied with a point. However, getting just a point didn t aid their mission to proceed to the quarterfinals. They trail Alger by six points and are five points behind second placed Sfaxien. With two group stage matches to play, Dikwena are winless and have only managed two points out of a possible 12.Progressing to the quarterfinals is no longer in their hands. They need favours from Mbabane Swallows and Alger to beat Sfaxien in the last two rounds of the group stages.The South Africans will also need to defeat Alger and Swallows and Jackson believes they can do that if they fix their leaking defence. There are still six points to play for. Hopefully, we can get all six and Sfaxien will lose their two games. sithembisod@thenewage.co.za-Sithembiso Dindi
