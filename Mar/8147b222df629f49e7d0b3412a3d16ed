One of the core messages of National School Health Week, which ends tomorrow, was to emphasise to parents the importance of deworming their children.The World Health Organisation revealed more than 600 million school children worldwide are at risk of parasitic worm infections and an estimated 400 million of these children remain untreated.Andr Spies, marketing manager at Cipla SA, said these worms were nasty parasites that feed off the human body and did not go away unless action was taken to get rid of them. Most people do not like to think about the idea of having worms in their bodies, however, it is a very common and normal issue for children and adults alike. It is vital that all parents ensure that they deworm their kids, as worms are everywhere and can contaminate public areas such as schools and playgrounds, Spies said.Since 2011, National School Health Week also brought focus to healthcare at schools in areas which lack adequate access to these services.Adopt-a-School Foundation partners with civil society corporate South Africa and the department of education to implement programmes tackling a wide range of health issues, from sanitation to sexual education and visual health. We need to work collectively to remove barriers to learning, including lack of healthcare, in order to create environments that are conducive to effective learning, Banyanga Mohajane, the foundations head of skills and social development. Our holistic school development approach not only puts focus on education but also on the socio-economic influences that affect our youth, including giving them access to much needed primary healthcare services. She said many female pupils could not afford sanitary pads and this led to them using inadequate substitutes like toilet paper, newspaper or pieces of fabric.Another Adopt-a-School Foundation programme focuses on awareness of sexual abuse and the support of victims of this abuse. In this regard the foundation continues to work with the government, law enforcement and community leaders to ensure that both parents and pupils are aware of the realities of sexual abuse and that the affected pupils have access to services that will allow them to recover from abuse.VINCENT CRUYWAGENvincentc@thenewage.co.za
