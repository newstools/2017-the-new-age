The Gauteng legislature has urged communities to petition the legislation rather than embark on violent protests following the settlement of a number of complaints that had been resolved after communities had petitioned the province.Amid 610 accidents and 37 deaths between 2012 and 2014, the roads and transport department has handed over the K111 road with new traffic-calming measures to the community of Lindokuhle, Ivory Park, at the weekend following intervention by the Gauteng legislature s petitions standing committee.Led by chairperson Refiloe Mogale, the standing committee received a petition from the community of Lindokuhle informal settlement saying that the traffic volumes on the road passing Kaalfontein Ext 01 and Lindokuhle West informal settlement were causing numerous deaths and accidents.The petitioners requested the committee to intervene and ensure delivery of services in the form of traffic calming measures. The department of roads and transport has now made provision for new traffic-calming measures in the area, speed to humps. The Lindokuhle petition is one of the five other petitions the standing committee has recently resolved that were formally closed during a committee meeting on June 8, Mogale said.The second petition related to a shortage of nurses at Temba Clinic, Tshwane, where the waiting period for patients and be assisted was reportedly between three to four hours. Upon the standing committee s intervention, the department of health responded favourably by investigating the matter and capacitating the clinic with sufficient nurses, she said.The third petition to have been resolved was that of a rejected application for a disability grant, with the petitioner suffering visual impairment being rejected due to an inaccurate medical physician s report. Upon the committee s intervention, the department of social development investigated the matter and granted the petitioner a disability grant after he had reapplied, Mogale said.The fourth closed petition was that of a sewage system in Greenfields, in Ekurhuleni, which posed a health hazard to the community. The committee intervened and ensured the Ekurhuleni metropolitan municipality fixes the sewage system and ensures its ongoing maintenance, Mogale said.The last petition to be tabled for closure involved a complaint by residents of Far East Bank Ext 1, Alexandra, north of Johannesburg, who alleged that a resident was selling liquor in a residential area.Mogale said the department of economic development which was requested to investigate the matter, reported that the owner was issued with a verbal warning and the situation would be closely monitored to minimise disturbances to neighbours. The standing committee once again commends all residents of Gauteng who are making use of the petitions process to ensure their service delivery challenges are resolved.Furthermore, it appreciates the work done by all departments and municipalities that appear before the committee and implement its resolutions, Mogale said.NTOMBI NKOSIntombin@thenewage.co.za
