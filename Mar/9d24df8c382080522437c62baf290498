Brazilian football legend Ronaldinho is set to visit Pakistan as part of a goodwill mission to promote the game in the cricket-mad country.The recently retired 36-year-old, who won the World Player of the Year twice and was part of the 2002 World Cup winning team, issued a short video message on Twitter saying simply &#8220;Pakistan, I am coming&#8221; as he unfurled a Pakistani flag.News of Ronaldinho&#8217;s visit has generated excitement among fans, and comes as the South Asian nation seeks to revive international sports fixtures that were disrupted by a militant attack on Sri Lanka&#8217;s cricket team in 2009.Those efforts were given a boost when the country successfully staged the final of its Pakistan Super League cricket tournament in Lahore earlier this month, a rare match featuring prominent international sports stars.Ronaldinho is being brought to the country by UK-based Leisure Leagues &#8212; organisers of 5, 6 and 7-a-side tournaments which recently announced plans to expand to Pakistan.Shahrukh Sohail, a Pakistan representative for the company confirmed the visit Tuesday, adding the company would be launching tournaments next month in Pakistan&#8217;s major cities Karachi, Islamabad and Lahore.He declined to say whether the Brazilian would arrive in time to make an appearance.Cricket-obsessed Pakistan has a strong base of football fans and players, particularly in southwestern Balochistan and the southern city of Karachi.But its national team has struggled in recent decades and has fallen to a lowly 198th place in the FIFA rankings.Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) officials were involved in court wranglings against each other for the last two years, forcing the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s teams out of international competitions.The Lahore High Court last month decided in favour of recognising Faisal Saleh Hayat as the federation&#8217;s chief, a post he has held on-and-off since 2003 without being able to turn around the team&#8217;s fortunes.Earlier this month, Spanish giants Barcelona announced their former star would return to act as an ambassador for the club.-AFP
