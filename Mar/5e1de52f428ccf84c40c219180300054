The Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa (Denosa) has called on unemployed nurses and healthcare workers in Gauteng to protest outside the Gauteng legislature during the tabling of the budget speech by MEC of finance Barbara Creecy.Creecy will be tabling this year s budget speech in the legislature today. According to Denosa, the protest is about staff shortages and the use of labour brokers. We are opposed to the utilisation of labour brokers because it opens room for corruption, exploitation and commercialisation of health, the union said.Denosa said: The challenges we are highlighting also place at risk the progress made by health workers in combating the spread of disease such as HIV, TB and strengthening of primary healthcare as preventative health care system. This will assist us not to spend too much on health and have a healthy working nation and that will strengthen our economy to grow. The union has also called on the Gauteng treasury to unlock and allocate more money to the provincial department of health. We also call on the Treasury to assist Gauteng health in strengthening its capacity to collect revenue especially from other provinces that use our facilities and fail to pay, it said.Denosa said while it appreciated the budget allocated to health last year, the department continued to have challenges around the filling of vacant posts. Our view is that the Gauteng department of health must publish its financial expenses report for financial year end before it can plan for the 2017-18 financial year so that we can see if it was able to use its budget effectively and that there is no underspending while we have thousands of unemployed nurses and other health workers, Denosa said.TNA REPORTER
