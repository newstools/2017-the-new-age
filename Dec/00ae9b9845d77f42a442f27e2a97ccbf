In a surprise turn of events, Gauteng Provincial Chairperson Paul Mashatile told delegates at the party’s Provincial General Council (PGC) that his nomination as party Treasurer General came as a shock to him. “I have never spent a considerable amount of time with the branches in the ANC Eastern Cape and the nomination to be Treasurer General came as a shock. I am honored and shocked to get a nomination from the Eastern Cape,” he said. Mashatile further said the slate concept played a major role in creating divisions within the movement, adding that meant a number of capable comrades would be excluded from leadership positions. “Unifying the party will require the ANC to move away from the slate concept, because often times the list is made the be all and end all, which should not be the case,” Mashatile added. He emphasised that the party has the strong willingness to move away from disunity. Mashatile said Saturday’s PGC will concentrate on policy issues such as land question and the finalising of the documents. The conference will also announce its preferred candidates which lead the party in the upcoming 54th National Elective Conference. Meanwhile, on Friday Mpumalanga, provincial chairperson David Mabuza emerged as the preferred candidate for the deputy president position while former KwaZulu-Natal premier Senzo Mchunu was nominated for secretary general. Gwede Mantashe was nominated for chairperson. -Sipho Jack
