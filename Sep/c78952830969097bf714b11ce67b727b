FOR a while, Kevin Lerena has been waiting for a shot at a world title as his 17 wins out of 18 bouts suggests that he is at the top of his game. Tomorrow night offers him a chance at being an IBO cruiserweight champion as he will be going toe to ztoe with Congolese, French-based Youri Kalenga at Emperors Palace in Kempton Park. The southpaw, who is four years Kalenga s junior, is hoping to build on his last two years when he has not lost a single fight.But in Kalenga, Lerena is aware that he is facing a different bull. Each opponent brings something different. I also found Roberto Bolonti tough. He doesn t engage. Bolonti got tired against Kalenga and then got KO d. But Kalenga never had it easy, Lerena, 25, said. He s a very tough nut. But for me, winning is most important and this is the first step to bigger things. A win can open doors. I ve got to be smart. I ve got to control the pace through all 12 rounds, Lerena, who is thoroughly prepared in case the bout goes the distance, said.Lerena will head into the bout with a 47% knockout record, while the 29 year old Kalenga has a 62% knockout record. The last time he lost also the only time, was back in November 2014 when he was beaten by Johnny The Hurricane Muller.Meanwhile, South Africa will witness another big fight next Saturday when Hekkie Budler will challenge for an IBF world light-flyweight title against Milan Melindo of the Philippines in Cebu City. Budler said he has watched enough fights by Melindo that he is confident of coming home with the title. The last time I was in the ring was back in February against Joey Canoy and I did well. I actually won my last two fights and as I go there to challenge for this title for the first time, I am confident that I will beat this guy. He is a really solid guy but I don t think he stands much of a chance against me, Budler said.mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za-Mmasekepe Matsebane
