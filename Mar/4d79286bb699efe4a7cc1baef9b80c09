Grammy-winning 90s R&amp;B group All 4 One landed in the country yesterday morning, ahead of their three city tour at the weekend.The group made up of friends Tony Borowiak, Delious Kennedy, Alfred Nevarez and Jamie Jones, promised fans a mix of some of their popular classics and some of their new material.They each took turns to address the media at a press conference at the Maslow Hotel. Though this is not their first time in SA, the tour marks the R&amp;B outfit s first SA performance following their initial visit in 2004.Kennedy said: Unfortunately, this will be our first time performing in SA as we never got a chance when we came here in 2004. We were actually waiting for Marmalade to call us up and here we are for the first time performing. Jones said their 2015 album, Twenty+, was a celebration of a career spanning more than two decades. We are proud of the work we have put into the album. To celebrate more than 20 years in the music industry we recorded 14 new songs and redid six of some of our old songs to mark the occasion, he said.All 4 One will kick off their tour on Friday at Cape Town s GrandWest Arena, which will be followed by Johannesburg at Carnival City on Saturday. Their last gig will be at Bloemfontein s Windmill Casino on Sunday.-SIYABONGA SITHOLE
