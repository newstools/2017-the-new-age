MURDERED Eskom employee Thembisile Yende s mother, Nesta Yende, sobbed in court when the prosecutor detailed how her daughter died during her suspected killer s final day of bail application in the Springs Magistrate s Court yesterday.Yende said it was painful for her to hear how her 29-year-old daughter had been killed and how her body was found in a store room at the same substation where her family had earlier gone to search of her. The painful thing is that I was called by the police on May 29 telling me that my daughter s body was found at her workplace. What breaks my heart is how I saw my daughter s decomposed body at the government mortuary.She had been strangled and had a black plastic bag wrapped around her face, Yende said. She said she wanted to know where and when her daughter had been killed so she could fix the date on her daughter s death certificate.During the bail application both defence and state gave their final submissions. The investigating officer, Lt-Col Christo Lotz, said the 44-year-old suspect, David Ngwenya, was identified by a sangoma he had visited before his arrest, along with two other suspects, to help them make the matter disappear .Police are still looking for the other two men. Defense advocate Francois Roets said Ngwenya was not a flight risk and was suitable for bail. He said the strength of the case was based solely on the sangoma who had identified Ngwenya.However, the state said this was a clear case of premeditated murder and evidence was clear that this was a planned killing.The case was postponed to tomorrow for magistrate Cornell Pretorious to rule on whether the suspect will be granted bail or not. On Monday, chilling details of how Yende was killed were revealed in court.Yende was injected with a drug to weaken her, beaten, strangled and also hit on the head with a heavy object. It is believed Yende was going to expose illegal dealings in copper involving Ngwenya, who is also an Eskom employee.DIKELEDI RAMABOPA dikeledir@thenewage.co.za
