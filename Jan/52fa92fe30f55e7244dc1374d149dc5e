The South African National Blood Service (SANBS) says its donor supply may be compromised as people who travelled to malaria-endemic areas over the holidays will not be able to donate blood for several weeks following their return.SANBS said donors who travelled to malaria high-risk areas would be allowed to donate blood only four weeks after their return, provided they had not experienced any symptoms commonly associated with malaria such as fever, sweating and headaches.Those who have contracted malaria are allowed to donate three years after completing treatment.Malaria is endemic in areas like the low veld of Mpumalanga, northern KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo, including the Kruger National Park.About 10 000 cases of malaria are detected in SA annually while sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 90-92% of global malaria cases and deaths in 2015, according to the World Health Organisation. We encourage donors to give us as much information as possible when answering the self-exclusion questionnaire as this is the first step in the blood collection process that enables us to safeguard the nation s blood supply to the best of our ability, SANBS marketing manager Silungile Mlambo said.The organisation said malaria was among the infectious diseases prioritised in the blood screening process to curb its transmission.The SANBS conducts comprehensive interviews to obtain information from donors and extensive laboratory testing of blood donated to eliminate infectious diseases like malaria, HIV, hepatitis B and C as well as syphilis as part of the screening process. SANBS understands that our various processes can sometimes be difficult to understand and remember. Therefore, we urge all existing and potential donors to always seek information and advice from our donor centres and other channels including the toll-free number and website, Mlambo said. 701478-TNA REPORTER
