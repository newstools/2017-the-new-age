Malawi&#8217;s former agriculture minister was Wednesday arrested and charged with graft for allegedly profiting in a $35-million maize import deal from neighbouring Zambia, officials said.George Chaponda has been battling against graft allegations following the controversial purchase of 100,000 tonnes of maize in July 2016.Malawi&#8217;s Anti-Corruption Bureau spokeswoman Egrita Ndala said that Chaponda had been charged with &#8220;misuse of public office and possession of foreign currency&#8221;.He was fired in February after police uncovered $223,000 (212,000 euros) in cash in his house during a raid.Chaponda was once seen as a close ally and potential successor of President Peter Mutharika.Malawi was last year forced to import food following a regional drought that hit southern Africa&#8217;s agricultural production.The impoverished country is alleged to have acquired the maize at a highly inflated rate, though Chaponda at that time justified the deal as a critical attempt to &#8220;save Malawi from hunger&#8221;.Pressure from parliamentarians led Mutharika in January to order an inquiry into the deal, which was brokered by the state-owned grain trader ADMARC.Corruption has been prevalent in Malawi&#8217;s public sector, and in 2013 several high-ranking officials were implicated in the &#8220;Cashgate&#8221; scandal, which involved large-scale looting of government coffers.International donors pulled the plug on aid of around $150 million after auditors said at least $30 million was stolen from state coffers over a six-month period.-AFP
