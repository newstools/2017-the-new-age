Less than 24 hours after McLaren took the wraps off its latest mid-engined 200mph convertible, Audi has unveiled the R8 Spyder V10 Plus, the fastest and most powerful series production soft top in the company&#8217;s history.How fast? Audi says that thanks to a 600+hp naturally aspirated (i.e., no turbos or superchargers) V10 engine sitting behind the driver&#8217;s seat but ahead of the rear axle, this particular R8 can hit 203mph (326km/h) and will take just 3.3 seconds to hit 100km/h from standstill.That makes it just 0.1 second slower to 100km/h than the latest McLaren and just marginally behind the 570S Spider&#8217;s 328km/h top speed. However, Audi would rather potential clients compare the car to the standard R8 Spyder V10. Do that and the new model is 25kg lighter, serves up 65 extra horsepower, a 6mph top speed improvement and is a whole 0.3 seconds faster off the line.To achieve these figures, Audi has looked to the track for engineering inspiration. &#8220;[The car] benefits from our many years of experience in motorsport and combines breath-taking dynamics with the emotion of an open-top sports car,&#8221; said Stephan Winkelmann, Managing Director of Audi Sport GmbH.So, it has aluminum double wishbone suspension, carbon ceramic composite brakes, a liquid cooling system for the multi-plate clutch and a spaceframe constructed from aluminum, carbon fiber-reinforced polymers.&#8220;The Audi R8 Spyder V10 plus completes the R8 model line,&#8221; said Stephan Winkelmann, Managing Director of Audi Sport GmbH. &#8220;The Spyder is now also available as a 610PS top version in addition to the Coup . It benefits from our many years of experience in motorsport and combines breathtaking dynamics with the emotion of an open-top sports car.&#8221;What&#8217;s more, there&#8217;s Audi&#8217;s phenomenal Quattro all-wheel drive system that will literally keep the car on track, pushing torque from axle to axle for the best traction, whatever the road conditions, aligned with a dynamic driving select system. This can be set up for wet weather conditions, snow, cruising or for setting the fastest possible time around the circuit. In full race mode, the system can even stop the car from dipping under braking or rolling in corners by applying magnetic force to the shock absorbers or bracing individual wheels.Audi will be offering owners an optional micommata green design package to go with the car at launch, which includes a unique green paint finish, a special grey finish to the front grille and black exhaust pipes. Inside the entire cabin is finished in black leather and black carbon fiber with contrasting green stitching.However, like all supercar makers, Audi now offers a huge range of customization possibilities for those that want something even more individual.-Relaxnews
