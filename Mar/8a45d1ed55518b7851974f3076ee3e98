A radical shift into mobile banking is rapidly changing the face of banking, and is likely to be a fully fledged next generation of corporate banking , especially for millions of unbanked people, the latest World Bank study found.With 42% of the global adult population still absent from a formal financial system, FinTech operators on the continent, such as Hello Paisa, are in a rare position to drive not only economic and innovation change, but also social change. Most adults in the region mainly use mobile money solutions to either buy airtime or make domestic remittance payments to relatives and friends.The introduction of new banking, investment, credit and insurance products using established mobile money solutions will be critical in including more Africans into the formal financial system. In the past four years, most SA outh banks launched their first mobile money transfer services in Africa.First National Bank (FNB) was SA s first mobile money transfer service provided in Africa, giving FNB account holders throughout South African provinces an option for sending and receiving international money transfers using their mobile phones. Other big local banks such as Standard Bank, Nedbank, Bidvest, and Absa followed with similar products that resulted in billions in cash distributed locally.According to the World Bank report, the rise of a new financial order through mobile banking is rapidly changing retail banking. The introduction of new banking, investment, credit and insurance products using established mobile money solutions will be critical in including more Africans into the formal financial system, according to the study.The scope for Hello Paisa to launch a mobile money solution has provided much needed financial services and remains extensive and stretches to more than two billion people globally, but most in Africa, according to World Bank statistics. Hello Paisa s efforts were recognised and recently awarded the Mastercard Foundation Clients at the Centre Awards for 2016, for basing its offering on three principles: offering a cost effective solution, client centricity and financial inclusion with a high adoption rate of such service.World Bank says by the end of 2017 roughly 87% of all broadband connections in emerging markets will be mobile. Hello Paisa continues to actively engage with regulators after being awarded the first independent money transfer operator licence by the South African Reserve Bank in 2014. This allowed Hello Paisa to bring financial technologies to migrants in SA.Angus Brown, co-founder of eBucks. com and managing director of Banking Acumen, said there were signs locally and abroad that banks were starting to cut back on human-centred service.-Bernard Sathekge|bernards@thenewage.co.za
