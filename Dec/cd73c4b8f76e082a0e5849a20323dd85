In a recently published report by the South African Revenue Service (Sars) and National Treasury, Gauteng is home to more than 40% of all registered taxpayers in South Africa, with Johannesburg being home to more. The information is contained in the 10th Annual Edition of Tax Statistics. According to the report, National Treasury said revenue from personal income tax (PIT), as a percentage of total tax revenue, increased from 29.6% in 2007-08 to 37.2% in 2016-17 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.8% and a proportion of 8.4% of GDP over this period. “This robust performance allowed government to offer large-scale tax relief to all South
Africans. This is despite the fact that the minimum tax thresholds for taxpayers below the age of 65 have increased from R40 000 in the 2007 tax year, to R73 650 in the 2016 tax year,” Treasury said. The report notes that tax thresholds have increased for senior citizens. “For those who are between 65 and 74 years, the minimum tax threshold increased from
R65 000 to R114 800 and for those who are 75 years and above, the threshold increased from R104 261 in the 2012 tax year when it was introduced, to R128 500.” The department also noted the impact that people movement has had on revenue collection. “Tax Statistics shows that a taxpayer earning a taxable income of R100 000 in 1995 paid tax at a rate of 33.8%. The same taxpayer, with income adjusted for increases limited to inflation, in 2016, earned R344 653 but had an effective tax rate of 18.3%, providing more disposable income.” The department said the adjustment of income brackets and the minimum tax threshold for fiscal drag has resulted in reducing marginal tax rates for low and middle-income taxpayers. “Measures to include the taxation of capital gains and taxing individuals on a residence basis on worldwide income have served to broaden the tax base, thus ensuring that the tax burden is spread more equitably.” Sars has also announced increased revenue tax collections in the past 10 years. It announced that the total revenue collected for the fiscal years from 2007-08 to 2016-17, amounted to R8.13 trillion. Sars said VAT collections remained the second largest revenue contributor over the past 10 years with the average of 25.9% of total tax. It said Corporate Income Tax (CIT) which has been the third highest contributor of total tax revenue in 2008-2009, briefly surpassed VAT as the biggest contributor but slipped back after the global financial crisis which affected many profitable companies. For 2017, Sars noted that tax revenue collected amounted to R1 144.1 billion, growing year-on-year by R74.1 billion which amounts to 6.9%. “This is despite tough economic conditions in which GDP increased from 0.5% to 0.7%, the Tax-to-GDP ratio stabilised at 26.0% from 2015/16, slightly below the peak of 26.4% which was achieved in 2007/08.” Sars said. In the past decade, It briefly surpassed VAT in 2008-09 but slipped back after the global
financial crisis, which affected the profitability of companies. Although CIT has retained its status as the third largest contributor, its relative
contribution has declined from a peak of 26.7% in 2008-09 to 18.1% in 2016-17. For 2017, Net VAT collections totaled R289.2 billion and grew by 2.9% compared to the previous year. According to Sars, domestic VAT, which amounted to R321.5 billion, grew by 8.1% and was a key driver for the aggregate growth. Sars indicated that VAT refunds totalled R181.6 billion and grew by 8.7%. -TNA Reporter
