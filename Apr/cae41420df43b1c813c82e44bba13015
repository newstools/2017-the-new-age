In distant Azerbaijan, Dino Ndlovu may not be dining with teams at Europe s top tables. But having achieved the league championship with Qarabag FK, Ndlovu has joined the list of overseas-based local players who have collected league medals across European leagues.And far from being a fringe player, the 27-year-old striker has been central to Qarabag s success, scoring a brace as they sealed their championship with a 3-0 win over Inter Baku, with two matches to spare. Azerbaijan could be a stepping for Ndlovu into the Champions League after Qarabag earned a spot in the qualifying rounds. But he will have to help secure his side one of the 32 places in the group stages.It s has also been a good Easter for Netherlands-based Kamohelo Mokotjo and Montpellier s Keagan Dolly. Just as he has been influential for FC Twente, Mokotjo completed 90 minutes for his side as they thumped NEC Breda 3-0. Dolly came on as a second-half substitute in their 2-0 win against Lorient. Montpellier have moved to 12th place in the 20-team league, eight points above the relegation zone.Bongani Zungu appears to have entrenched himself in his Portuguese side Vitoria Guimaraes. Amajita striker Luther Singh has improved for Portuguese second-tier side Sporting Braga B, while Andile Jali is still battling to win back his place in his Belgian team Oostende.-KGOMOTSO SETHUSHA|kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
