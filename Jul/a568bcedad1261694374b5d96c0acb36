At least R700bn worth of investment remains in the hands of banks and the financial services sector who are holding the key to expediting transformation.ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize said this while addressing a business forum session at the party s policy conference yesterday. What will it take for the private sector to invest that money in our economy? Mkhize said.Mkhize challenged the financial services sector to show intent towards the transformation of the country s economy.He said the ANC had no intentions to build a democracy of poor people . We are not going to build a democracy of poor people, of unemployed people and expect them to think that democracy is delivering, Mkhize said.He went on to disclose that the government was ready to invest R3 trillion on infrastructure but is only prepared to make the investments in a transformed construction sector. The government cannot inject R3 trillion into a construction sector that is not transformed, he said.He reiterated government s call to work closely with business to fast-track transformation.Mkhize further said the ruling party s thrust was to reconcile the disadvantaged and those benefiting from the current structure of the economy in an effort to move forward and expand the economy. One of the major reasons we had to deal with the issue of reconciliation was to give South Africans a chance to know that they re one people and that the country belongs to all of us and each of us have a responsibility to build this democracy, he said.He believes the radical economic transformation will significantly reduce the levels of unemployment by 2030 and create 3 million jobs.He said the ANC had adopted the National Development Plan as its own and has the responsibility to ensure it is understood, not only by its members, but also members of the society. We are all working towards that framework. Mkhize also stressed the need to change ownership patterns in the economy, adding that failure to do so would undo the gains of the country s democracy.MTHOKOZISI DUBEmtokozisid@thenewage.co.za
