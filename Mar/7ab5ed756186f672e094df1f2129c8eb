THE double murder of a South African Communist Party (SACP) activist and taxi operator Mthobeli Matyumza, 51 and his 32-year-old driver, Sivuyile Ntontole, has sent shock waves among SACP members in the Eastern Cape town of Jeffreys Bay.Matyumza s wife survived the attack which took place at their home in Mandela township on Sunday night. The SACP praised Matyumza for dedicating most of his life to political and civic activism, calling on police to take swift action. We call on the SAPS to leave no stone unturned in ensuring that the murderers are brought to book and call on the community to come forward with any information that may help with the investigation, SACP branch secretary Thabiso Klaas said.The motive for the murders in which at least three men were involved, is not yet known, the police spokesperson Sgt Majola Nkohli, said. Two of the men pulled out firearms, walked straight into the house and shot the two men.A third gunman grabbed the woman who was in the garden and ushered her inside but she managed to flee to a neighbour s house. The suspects then fled the scene, Nkohli said.Matyumza, who was a political activist since the 80s was branch chairperson of the Chule KK Papiyane district (Sarah Baartman) at the time of his death. Matyumza is a long-serving member of the party in the Kouga sub-district who has contributed immensely to the life of the organisation and the structures of the movement, both politically and materially, Klaas said. He was a well-known anti-apartheid activist. He constantly had to leave home (in the 80s) to evade arrest or dodge bullets when hit squads visited his hometown of Hankey. At the time of his death, he was the chairperson of the Ward 14 branch of the SACP and a branch treasurer of the ANC in the Kouga sub-region. Our sincere condolences go out to his family, comrades, friends and the family of the driver. SIYA MITI
