Manchester City striker Gabriel Jesus came off injured after 22 minutes of their Premier League match at Crystal Palace on Sunday. The Brazilian, who suffered a foot injury in February that put him out for several months of last season, was clearly upset when he walked off with a leg injury to be replaced by Sergio Aguero. The score was 0-0 at halftime after Aguero hit the post soon after coming on with his first shot at goal. It was not immediately clear how seriously Jesusâ€™s injury was. -Reuters
