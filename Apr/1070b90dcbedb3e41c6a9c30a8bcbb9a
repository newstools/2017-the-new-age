What would a South African Easter holiday be without a Joyous Celebration album?Last night, 216 14th Avenue in Roodepoort was the place to be for the launch of Joyous Celebration s 21st album, Heal Our Land. The album, recorded in Potter s House of Dallas, TX, under the leadership of Bishop TD Jakes late last year, will certainly give fans of the award-winning gospel ensemble something to cherish these Easter holidays.With the country facing political and social challenges, the ensemble sounded the call for South Africans and their fans from across the globe to pray for healing as part of its Heal Our Land campaign ahead of the launch. We need healing, not only as South Africans but as the people of the world.Our politics, our homes and all sections of our lives need healing, the band s musical director and composer, Mnqobi Nxumalo told The New Age.As has been the case over the years, the founders of the group travelled the length and breadth of the country in search of new talent.The result is new faces such as Siyakha Tshayela (alto), Khaya Sibanyoni and Gospel Silinda (tenors), Frank Mavhimara (guitar), Junior Petja (keyboard), Khola Phalatse (bass guitar) and an additional three gifted members of the band s brass section who will sound the healing call as part of the band s countrywide tour.Nxumalo is also proof of the work being done by the band, having risen from the ranks to become not only one of the regular composers, but also the musical director, having joined Joyous in 2014.The recording has been described as a seed that Joyous Celebration jointly and prayerfully planted together with The Potter s House for many of its loyal fans. We ask everyone to join us to pray for the healing we so desperately need, Hlongwane said.The award-winning outfit celebrates more than two decades of great, heart-stopping gospel music that has captivated audiences across the world, with a tour set to kick off with a three-night spectacle at Carnival City Casino from April 14 to 16.Cape Town will get a dose of healing with two performances at the Good Hope Christian Church on June 2-3.Next up is Sun City on July 29, followed by Durban International Convention Centre on August 4 and 5.Vista Arena in Bloemfontein will get their healing on September 2, followed by Thohoyandou on September 8. We are celebrating our 21st anniversary and there is a lot to be excited about or this year s tour because we are coming of age. The response we encountered in the US during the recording and the support, prayers and well wishes from people here at home and across the globe was phenomenal. For this, we are truly humbled and believe that not only will the world receive our latest offering with enthusiasm but will also strongly relate and resonate with the Heal Our Land message, co-founder Lindelani Mkhize said. We have come a long way with MTN Joyous Celebration and are proud to be associated with this award-winning ensemble as they come of age with their 21st offering to their multitudes of fans. We have no doubt that this will be the biggest tour in the group s history and we hope everyone will join hands and spread the Heal Our Land message. SIYABONGA SITHOLE
