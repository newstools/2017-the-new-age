The sentencing of convicted killer Zwelethu Mthethwa has been postponed to May 24 at the Western Cape Magistrate court on Thursday.Last month the Western Cape High Court found the artist guilty of murder for killing a sex worker.Nokuphila Khumalo was beaten to death by Mthethwa in Woodstock, Cape Town in 2013. Mthethwa had pleaded not guilty.Judge Patricia Goliath in March criticised Mthethwa defense saying they had attacked the deceased with authenticity of CCTV footage without evidence that the footage was tampered with.The State alleged that CCTV footage captured the artist stopping his black Porsche 911 Carrera close to Khumalo in the early hours of that morning.It further alleged that the footage shows the accused exiting his vehicle and repeatedly kicking her and stamping on her body with booted feet . She died as a result of blunt-force trauma.William Booth, Mthethwa&#8217;s lawyer on Thursday argued that his client needs time to sort out his life before the sentencing. He needs to make long-term arrangements for all aspects of his life, Booth told Judge Patricia Goliath while reading out his client s affidavit.According to reports, Mthethwa wants to personally inform his 15-year-old daughter in England of his conviction and wants to sort out her tertiary education and funding for the next few years.The water and electricity accounts at his R5-million home in Devil s Peak Estate had to be taken care of, along with his Porsche, furniture, and art collection.It is said that he also wanted to sort out eating plans and make arrangements with prison authorities as he is gluten intolerance.The State countered that none of these challenges were unconquerable.Meanwhile Lesego Tlhwale from women&#8217;s rights group Sex Workers Education and Advocacy Task Force (SWEAT) on Thursday said they are disappointed by the postponement.&#8220;We want the case to finish so that Nokuthula&#8217;s mother can get closure. We are writing a letter to the court because this case has been delayed for too long,&#8221; said Tlhwale.TNA Reporter &nbsp;&nbsp;
