Finance Minister Pravin Gorhan continued to stick with the fiscal framework to curb unnecessary spending in a bid to make sure money is used wisely or redirected where needed the most.He said the fiscal framework adopted by the Cabinet will continued operating to seek all spheres of government maintaining efficiency to deal with the content of fiscal policy.Despite a weaker revenue outlook, the government remains on track to contain the budget deficit and stabilise national debt as a share of GDP. The budget 2017 reflects a balance between maintaining our spending commitments, and ensuring long-term health of the public finances, Gordhan said. Slow economic growth has held us back and as a result decisive steps are needed to strengthen confidence, investment and growth. Gordhan said they are targeting to reduce spending by a total of R26bn over the next two years, while proposed expenditure for 2017-18 totals R1.56 trillion, interest on debt amounts to R169bn and projected revenue of R1.41 trillion. A balance of R149bn or 3.1% of GDP will be borrowed, he said.He said the government s debt now stands at R2.2 trillion or 50.7% of GDP and will be stabilised to 48%. By acting now to stabilise debt, we will ensure that future generations will not pay for today s expenses 20 or 30 years from now. He said if the country experienced bigger economic growth, the level of debt will be changed significantly. Debt coming at 48% is well achieved where we are now. The Treasury said the big issue with bringing debt down lies with GDP growth, so it aims to stabilise debt in line with its fiscal objectives. Going forward, growth is vital since our intention is to lower debt, Gordhan said.The policy statement has also reiterated straitened times for government departments to cut back on their spending, particularly on employees.For example, the voluntarily retirement framework aimed at reducing the salary bill to save more money, which is under way.The main budget net borrowing requirement will increase by R43bn in 2016-17 and 2018-19 compared with the 2016 budget.The borrowing requirement is discussed in government which has adhered to the spending ceiling since it was established in 2012, as spending plans allow for moderate real expenditure growth, with priority given to higher education, health and social development.The government wage bill will stabilise as a share of the budget, as a result of measures to reduce appointments in non-critical posts.According to the policy statement, the government is committed to a measured path of fiscal consolidation that contains the budget deficit and stabilises public debt.Further, head count in the public service has levelled out, relieving some of the upward pressure on the wage bill. The government s fiscal stance takes account of risks associated with the macro-economic outlook, budget execution and the finances of some state-owned companies. As a result of these measures, the main budget primary deficit has narrowed over the past four years, despite slowing economic growth.As a share of GDP, the primary deficit halves in a year and will move into surplus over the mid term.A measured approach that protects the public finances and creates an enabling environment for faster economic growth is required.The budget proposals will reduce the expenditure ceiling by R10bn in 2017-18 and R16bn in 2018-19.This will be achieved through reduced national department operating budgets, lower transfers to entities, provinces and local government, and reallocations.The minister stressed that the central fiscal policy objective is to stabilise the national debt-to-GDP ratio by closing the budget deficit.Bernard Sathekgebernards@thenewage.co.za
