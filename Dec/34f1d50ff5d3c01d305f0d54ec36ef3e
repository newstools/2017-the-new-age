Mamelodi Sundowns has extended its lead at the top of the Absa Premiership table, to seven points, after hammering Bloemfontein Celtic 4-1 on Saturday at the Loftus Stadium in Pretoria. Goals from Thokozani Sekotlong, Tiyani Mabunda, Percy Tau and Themba Zwane were enough to ensure the Brazilians registered their ninth win in the league. Celtic walked away with a consolation goal after Ronald Pfumbidzai tried to bring his side back into the match but Sundowns were strong enough to deny them a much-needed come back. The Brazilians are playing catch-up games but have scored most goals in the league and are left with a game in hand to catch up with other clubs. Coach Pitso Mosimane was impressed with the performance of his club. “It is good when you are home you get confidence. We have instilled confidence now in our home games. We have been having 100% record win away but against Chippa we didn’t win,” Mosimane said. Mosimane said Celtic gave them a run for their money, despite defeating them with a big margin. “They are all tight, even the Maritzburg was tight. I think Cape Town City will be tighter than this. “But you have to score the goals because if you don’t score the goals you cannot win. We got the opportunities in the second half and we scored four and I can’t ask for more.” The Tshwane outfit will be looking to stretch the lead at the to of the table on Tuesday when they face second place Cape Town City on Tuesday at Loftus Stadium. -TNA Reporter
