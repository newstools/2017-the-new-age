With the State of The Nation Address only a few hours away Democratic Alliance Chief Whip John Steenhuisen says the party expects President Jacob Zuma to outline concrete plans for job creation.&#8221; We have a situation where 8.9 million South Africans are sitting at home without the dignity of work unable to provide for their families and their future. &#8221; said Steenhuisen.&#8221; We need to hear concrete plans about how we intend to get the economy moving and how we are going to get South Africans working&#8230;what we need is less talk and more concrete steps about how work is going to be created &#8221; continued Steenhuisen. Steenhuisen also said the DA would expect to hear the President outline plans on the funding of higher education.The DA is also looking forward to hear how government intends on tackling crime in the country.&#8221; There needs to be a far more comprehensive plan on how to deal with rural crime. There far too many attacks on our citizens, particularly farmers and farm workers. &#8221; said Steenhuisen.-TNA Reporter&nbsp;
