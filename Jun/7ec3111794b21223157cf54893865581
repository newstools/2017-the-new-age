National Treasury has warned that at the current growth rate, a further decline in GDP revenue may be on the horizon with the potential to jeopardise the delivery of social services.The warning by the treasury in its statement issued today, comes after StatsSA yesterday announced that the local economy had contracted by 0.7% in the first three months of the year after a shrink of 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016.The underperforming economy means South Africa has slipped into recession for the first time in eight years since 2008-2009.According to the Treasury, the state of the economy means that stakeholders including the government, business and labour, will have to work hard to improve confidence in the local economy as a matter of urgency.In a statement, the Treasury said: Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba will be seeking a meeting with business leaders soon to discuss ways of working together to achieve inclusive economic growth. South Africa has now joined its two fellow members in Brics Russia and Brazil who are also in the grip of recession.The main contributors to the recession were the manufacturing and trade sectors, dropping 3.7% and 5.9% respectively.Coupled with a recently announced 14 years of high unemployment rate, the local economic prospects seem rather dim, according to economic analysts.The Quarterly Labour Force Survey published by Stats SA showed that unemployment had jumped in the three months through March despite the 144 000 jobs created.Read: Unemployment shocking figures worsen in the Eastern CapeThe jobless rate now sits at 27.7% in the first quarter of 2017, up from 26.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016.However, despite the negative outlook the Treasury claims that there could be a number of positive attributes the economy could leverage to work its way to a positive footing. These include improving global growth, stabilising commodity prices, the creation of favourable economic conditions, reliable electricity supply and less volatile labour relations.-TNA Reporter
