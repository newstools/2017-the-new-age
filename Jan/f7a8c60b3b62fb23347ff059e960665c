Sergio Aguero came off the bench to score as Manchester City made light of playing for an hour with 10 men to beat Burnley 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium on Monday.City, needing a quick response after defeat at title rivals Liverpool on Saturday, suffered a blow when Fernandinho was red-carded just past the half hour mark for a wild-looking tackle on Burnley&#8217;s Iceland midfielder Johann Berg Gudmundsson.The hosts dominated after the break, however, and took the lead after 58 minutes when Gael Clichy&#8217;s low shot crept past Burnley keeper Tom Heaton and into the far corner.Aguero, introduced as a second-half substitute, doubled City&#8217;s lead with a fine finish from a tight angle four minutes later but Ben Mee halved the deficit to set up a tense finale.City moved above Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal into third spot in the Premier League with 42 points, seven behind leaders Chelsea who play away at Spurs on Wednesday.-Reuters
