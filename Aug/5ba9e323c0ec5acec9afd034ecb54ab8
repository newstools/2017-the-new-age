A TOTAL of 15 needy students who are academically deserving will now pay full attention to their studies at the University of Limpopo (UL) without worrying about outstanding tuition debts, thanks to the Hillensberg Trust Grant.The bursaries with a total worth R1m for tuition fees, prescribed textbooks, residence and meals were awarded to first and second level students in the fields of health sciences and humanities yesterday.Second level BA performing arts student, Mpelege Masewawatla, 26, said the funding was a relief as she was coming from the family of a single mother. It was already difficult for my mother to pay for my fees. Now I can focus on my studies knowing I will improve the livelihood of my siblings in the near future Masewawatla said.Thabang Malaka, 20, a first year pharmacy student said the bursary came at an opportune time as his father died last year and his mother was finding it difficult to pay for his tuition fees single-handedly. My sister is presently studying BSc in animal production and my mother was not coping with both of us at varsity. The funding will make things easy for her, Malaka said.Tlhologelo Radebe, 19, a second level BSc optometry student, said with the bursary at her disposal she was already able to see a bright future ahead with a clear vision. I am going to work hard and pass well to realise my dream of opening an optometry practice, Radebe said.Acting director of UL Trust Carina Marais said the partnership with Hillensberg Trust was a meaningful stride towards the development and well-being of the country. As the university we are very grateful for this funding as it will not only contribute to students but also to the development of our country, Marais said.Deputy vice-chancellor (academic and research at UL) Prof Richard Madadzhe commended the funding and said beneficiaries were fortunate in view of student funding challenges gripping the country due to economic recession. Grab this funding opportunity with both hands by studying hard so that you can create job opportunities for other students, Madadzhesaid.
