TODAY marks the beginning of the Universitas Academic Hospital Smile Week, which plans to provide reconstructive surgery to 11 Free State children in Bloemfontein.The initiative that will run until February 10, is driven by a South African non-governmental organisation, Smile Foundation, which focuses on children with facial disfigures to receive reconstructive surgery within South Africa.One of the 11 children who are set to receive surgery is 10-year-old Selloane, whose life took a turn for the better in 2015 when she received a prosthetic ear as part of the Universitas Academic Hospital Smile Week.This year the young girl, who tragically sustained third-degree burns to her body as a small child, returns to the hospital s Smile Week and takes another step on her road to recovery as surgeons insert a tissue expander under her skin to encourage hair growth to the majority of her scalp that was affected by the burns.Selloane s story is one of the many successes of Smile Week. Another 10 youngsters from Bloemfontein and surroundings will join her in receiving life-changing surgery.The 11 children range in age from just four months to 10 years and will mostly have cleft lip and cleft palate repair surgery done.Speaking to The New Age, executive director for the Smile Foundation, Hedley Lewis, said he was excited for what Smile Week will bring to the lives of young children. We are motivated to give every child a life that is as normal as possible. I am excited for this week as this means that more lives will be changed for the better, he said.Lewis thanked stakeholders and supporters including Vodacom Foundation which has played a role in making sure that children have received reconstructive surgery.Vodacom Foundation executive head Mthobeli Tengimfene said all children deserved the chance to reach their full potential in life. The Vodacom Foundation is privileged to partner the Smile Foundation in helping these youngsters regain the full use of their facial expressions. -NONTOKOZO GXUMISA
