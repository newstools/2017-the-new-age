As Eskom battles to recoup billions of rands from consumers across the country, AfriForum and its commercial interest group AfriBusiness have launched a court bid to prevent the utility from cutting power to five municipalities that have not paid their bills.AfriForum said Eskom was planning to cut power to municipalities in the North West, Northern Cape and Free State by tomorrow because certain municipalities had failed to transfer funds that were collected from residents for electricity to Eskom.The legal representative of AfriForum and AfriBusiness, Willie Spies, said they were of the opinion that Eskom, as a state-managed entity, had other legal measures at its disposal to recover its fees. To punish paying and law abiding citizens and institutions for the negligence of incompetent municipal administrations does not make sense, Spies said.He said the approach of Eskom to threaten the summary power cuts of full municipal areas was a draconic and unconstitutional measure which boils down to collective disadvantage of payers, as well as non-payers .Spies said on March 22 and 23, the North Gauteng High Court will hear a comprehensive application from AfriForum and AfriBusiness to determine if Eskom s practice to disadvantage residents due to the neglect of poorly managed municipalities to fulfil their obligations is unconstitutional.The power utility yesterday declined to comment because the matter was now in the hands of the courts.Last year, the then Eskom CEO Brian Molefe said defaulting municipalities owed the power utility R6bn.He said that out of the 281 municipalities which owed the power utility, 100 of them owed more than R500000.Molefe also said that 56 payment agreements were in place, of which 11 municipalities were fully honouring their payment arrangements.However, an additional 45 municipalities were not. He said disconnection notices had been issued to the defaulting municipalities.National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) granted Eskom a 9.4% tariff increase while Eskom had initially applied for 16.6%.Eskom had requested the tariff increase in order to recover costs of R22.8bn.TNA Reporternews@thenewage.co.za
