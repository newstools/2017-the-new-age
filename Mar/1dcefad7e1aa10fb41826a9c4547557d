The case against two University of Cape Town (UCT) students allegedly involved in protests under the banner #FeesMustFall has been referred to the local regional court.Masixole Mlandu, a fourth-year political science student, appeared in the Wynberg Magistrate s Court on Wednesday where he was not asked to plead.He is facing charges of intimidation following his alleged involvement during protest action at the university last year.Mlandu was facing four other charges and appeared in separate courtrooms, but has since acknowledged his wrongful actions in two of the cases.He was ordered to do community service through Nicro as punishment.In another case, the activist will be back in court towards the end of this month to face charges of malicious damage to property relating to the damage at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology.The magistrate, Goolam Bawa, cancelled warrants of arrests on Wednesday, that were earlier issued for Mlandu and another UCT student activist, Sibusiso Mpendulo, after they failed to appear in court.Their lawyer, Lufuno Musetsho, however, told the court that the students had reported to a different court on the fourth floor and were waiting there. Your case has been postponed to March 30 and it is transferred to the regional court for trial, Bawaon said.The defence lawyer had previously said they were intending to stop the proceedings. We don t want the case to go to trial. We will be making representations to stop it from proceeding, Musetsho said.The state alleges that Mlandu led a group of students who broke into the campus protection services office and intimidated the guards.The UCT lodged criminal charges with the police which led to his arrest in October. On another charge, Mlandu was arrested for allegedly violating a court order during a protest at UCT.The incident took place a week after he spent time in custody at Pollsmoor prison awaiting a bail hearing on charges of malicious damage to property and assault for an incident at CPUT.He appeared in court and was released on bail of R500. Prior to that, Mlandu was arrested on October 4 for contravening a court order. He allegedly tried to force students to take part in campus protests and was part of a group which barricaded the entrance to the upper campus.Mlandu was also arrested on May 25 for allegedly trespassing on campus. He was expelled due to the role he played in the Shackville protest in February where students erected a shack on the upper campus as a symbol of the struggle for student housing.nadinef@thenewage.co.za
