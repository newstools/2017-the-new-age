Aspen Phamarcare today responded to the Competition Commission’s decision that it would investigate claims of suspected abuse and dominance in respect of the provision of cancer medication in South Africa. Other companies that have been targeted by the Commission for investigation include Pfizer and Roche Holdings in what has been described as investigation of “grave national importance”that must attract “the highest priority”. In a statement the company said pharmaceutical prices in the country were approved by the South African Department of Health in terms of the Single Exit Price (“SEP”) regulatory framework. The framework establishes a universal fixed price for each pharmaceutical product.
The organisation added that it had not increased pricing of its products outside of the  framework and has clearly demonstrated its commitment to providing quality medicines affordably over many years. The supply of the oncology products in question was no exception. The Commission’s decision to probe was announced earlier yesterday. It plans to investigate the price of cancer medicines of three pharmaceutical companies.It said it  would investigate local pharmaceutical company Aspen Pharmacare for alleged “abuse of dominance” Aspen has welcomed the opportunity to meet and clarify a number key issues on the products listed for investigation by the Commission. This move has been welcomed by the Fix the Patent Laws Coalition, pronouncing that the probe would be a major victory in the struggle to ensure that all people in the country would access the medicines they need to stay healthy and alive.
