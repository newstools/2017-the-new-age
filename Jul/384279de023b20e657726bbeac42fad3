German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday she expected the Group of 20 leading economies to broadly agree on tackling international terrorism at a summit in Hamburg later this week but said they would likely have differences on other issues.&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll have unified positions on all issues at the end but it&#8217;s sensible and honest to talk to each other on all issues of international diplomacy,&#8221; she told a news conference.Merkel suggested the United States under President Donald Trump was at odds with others on some issues, saying: &#8220;We know certain positions that the American government holds and I don&#8217;t expect that these positions will be abandoned as a result of a two-day trip to Hamburg.&#8221;-AFP
