In a twist of events at the ANC’s 5th day, North West Chairman Supra Mahumapelo says the organisation must accept the outcome of the Steering Committee meeting with its best and worst. Mahumapelo said although he cannot comment on the outcome rather the ‘amicable decision’ the committee decided regarding the Secretary-General position. “I can’t comment on what the “amicable decision” is on the SG position. As a democratic organisation we must accept the outcome with the best and the worst.” He said this amid the seating of plenary which is scheduled to debate the issues of whether to recount the special vote that was uncounted for on Monday. Mahumapelo also urged members to respect the leadership collective behind Cyril Ramaphosa, saying that they can’t flop at the last minute. He further said the conference must be concluded today (Wednesday). “Conference must end on the high, so as to give hope to people about the land”. The North West Premier said the party needs to adapt to a new phenomenon of court cases, saying the organisation will also be faced with court threats on everything they do. Meanwhile, there are reports that surfaced, suggesting that out of the much 68 votes only 15 were legit and that they don’t make a bearing on the SG position. According to reports, the 48 plus had failed the audit, but they were however issued with tags based on pre auditing outcome. “The IEC and Steering Committee has concluded its business and report shall be given to plenary,” the report read. -Sipho Jack
