Dozens of protesters against Venezuela&#8217;s socialist President Nicolas Maduro massed outside a cultural centre in Madrid on Thursday evening as the country&#8217;s ambassador to Spain, who was stuck inside, decried what he called a &#8220;kidnapping&#8221; by demonstrators.Several hundred people gathered outside the extension of the Venezuelan embassy at around 1630 GMT.By 2100 GMT, dozens of protesters were still chanting &#8220;Venezuela, freedom!&#8221; at the site in central Madrid. Some banged pots and pans, though Spanish riot police had pushed back much of the thinning crowd behind a line of police vans.Mario Isea, the Venezuelan ambassador in Madrid, earlier told state TV channel VTV that he was holed up inside the centre with embassy staff.&#8220;We are besieged,&#8221; Isea told the channel by telephone, adding that Spanish authorities had not moved rapidly enough to defuse the situation sooner. &#8220;They refuse to move and they want to set conditions for us to be able to leave. This is a kidnap.&#8221;It was not clear when he would leave. The Venezuelan embassy could not be reached for comment.Demonstrations against Maduro&#8217;s government have flared up across Venezuela over the last month, as opposition supporters pour onto the streets demanding elections and in protest against the economic crisis.&#8220;What we want are elections and for Maduro to step down,&#8221; said Salvador Rocafull, a Spanish-Venezuelan urological surgeon who had joined the crowd in Madrid.-Reuters
