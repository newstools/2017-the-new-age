&#8220;Perseverance, determination and persistence&#8221; these were words used by the Executive Mayor of Ekurhuleni Mzwandile Masina to describe Senzo Vilakazi known as Kwesta for his resounding win at the 23rd Sama awards.The City of Ekurhuleni joined thousands of South Africans in congratulating Kwesta on his success, winning five awards at the 23rd Sama Awards annual event.&#8220;The talented Katlehong born artist is evidence that a lot is possible through hard work and commitment,&#8221; said Masina.Whilst he scooped so many awards in one night, Kwesta joins many stars who continuously shine, not only representing the City but the country such as DJ Shimza, DJ Sbu, Lira, Charlize Theron.&#8220;His journey illustrates that success doesn t happen overnight but recognition of talent happens in its own time through immense hard work and years of working on a craft and dedication to passion.&#8221;Masina added that as the city they wish to honour him and hope that this is only the beginning of greater things to come, for the Katlehong born star!-TNA Reporter
