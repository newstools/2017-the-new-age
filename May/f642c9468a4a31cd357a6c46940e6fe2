The ANC says the judgement compelling President Jacob Zuma to provide reasons for his cabinet reshuffle signifies unfettered encroachment of the judiciary into the realm of the executive.On Thursday the North Gauteng High Court yesterday ordered Zuma to provide within five working days records and reasons for his Cabinet reshuffle which saw former minister of finance Pravin Gordhan being replaced.Judge Bashir Vally yesterday said Zuma must supply all records and all documents relating to correspondence, contracts, memoranda, advice, recommendations, evaluations and reports that influenced his decision to reshuffle his cabinet&#8221; This judgment signifies unfettered encroachment of the judiciary into the realm of the executive &#8211; pandering to the whims of the opposition who want to co-govern with the popularly elected government through the courts,&#8221;&#8221; The Constitution confers upon the President powers to constitute his Cabinet without imposing an obligation upon him to consult opposition parties in the exercise of this discretionary function,&#8221; said ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa.Kodwa added that Thursdays court ruling is a use of the judiciary by the opposition to police political decisions which &#8220;sets a very worrisome precedent,&#8221;The ANC, following a meeting of its National Working Committee shortly after the reshuffle, accepted an &#8220;irretrievable breakdown of the relationship&#8221; between Zuma and Gordhan as a sufficient explanation for his decision to fire the minister.Meanwhile the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) which brought the court application has described the ruling as a &#8220;victory for all South Africans.&#8221;&#8221; It is high time that those in power and especially the President, are held accountable for their actions and decisions based on self-interest and personal gain rather than the best interests of our country, &#8221; said DA Federal Executive Chairperson, James Selfe.Opposition party Congress of the People (COPE) also welcomed the ruling saying it was &#8220;eager to see if Zuma is still going to give his original reason &#8216;fake intelligence report&#8217; for his reckless reshuffle.&#8221;Zuma allegedly relied on an intelligence report when he removed Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas.During the World Economic Forum in Durban, Zuma said he reshuffled his Cabinet to give young people a chance at leadership and to prepare them for the future.
