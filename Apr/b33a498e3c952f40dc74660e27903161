The Competition Commission has referred a supplier of the main ingredient in clinker bricks, largely used in the construction of RDP houses, for prosecution in the Competition Tribunal for abusing its dominance by charging excessive prices.The commission explained that Afrimat Limited (Afrimat), through its wholly owned subsidiary Clinker Supplies (Pty) Ltd (Clinker), had exclusive rights from Eskom to source waste ash from dumps at three disused coal-fired power stations in Gauteng (Klip and Vaal) and the Free State (Vuurfontein).&#8220;Afrimat also has royalty and indefinite land rental agreements with Eskom until the ash dumps are exhausted,&#8221; the commission said in a statement.The company is, therefore the only supplier of clinker ash within a 100km radius of each respective ash dump site.All clinker brick manufacturers in these areas, who use the clinker ash aggregate, are therefore dependent on Afrimat.During an investigation the commission found that following the acquisition of Clinker in 2002 &#8220;Afrimat escalated the pricing of clinker ash aggregate significantly&#8221;.&#8220;The investigation found that the prices exceeded its economic value dramatically,&#8221; Sipho Ngwema, Head of Communications said on Sunday.The Commission has found that Afrimat abused its dominant position from 2012 until at least 2016 (the conduct may be ongoing) by charging clinker bricks manufacturers excessive prices to the detriment of consumers. In addition, the Commission found that the prices bear no relation to the economic value of the product.&nbsp;The Commission is seeking an order from the Tribunal declaring that Afrimat has contravened the Competition Act and that it must pay the maximum fine (administrative penalty) allowable by law which amounts to 10% of its annual turnover in South Africa as well as its exports from the country.
