Unemployment in Europe&#8217;s largest economy Germany hit a new record low in January, official data showed Tuesday, beating analyst expectations and filling out a picture of rude health painted by indicators.Just 5.9 percent of people were out of work in January, seasonally-adjusted figures from the Federal Labour Agency (BA) showed, a slight fall of 0.1 percentage points.Analysts surveyed by Factset had forecast unemployment would remain at the 6.0-percent level it first reached in October.In seasonally-adjusted figures, 26,000 fewer people were out of work in January than in December.&#8221;The labour market made a good start to the new year,&#8221; BA chief Frank-Juergen Weise said in a statement.The shift downwards puts unemployment at an all-time low since the country&#8217;s reunification in 1990, continuing a downward trend visible since 2009.January&#8217;s slight fall in unemployment follows on the heels of a strong consumer confidence survey and a healthy uptick in inflation to 1.9 percent.But the strong indicators are overshadowed by concerns about what a year full of political uncertainty over Donald Trump, Brexit, and a string of elections in the eurozone will bring.The closely-watched Ifo business confidence survey fell to its lowest level since September in January, with firms happy with their present state but fearful for the coming six months.Germany&#8217;s federal government predicts growth will fall back to 1.4 percent in 2017 after hitting 1.9 percent last year, although it says much of the drop will be due to a lower number of working days.-AFP
