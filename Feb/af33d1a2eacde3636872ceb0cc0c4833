KAIZER Chiefs coach Steve Komphela appears to finally be getting the best out of his players who have been producing a string of decent performances of late. Following a frustrating early season, it now looks like happy days are back at the club.The days when missiles would rain down on the hapless Komphela as livid Chiefs fans showed their frustration are behind him. Amakhosi have recorded four successive victories and have had two impressive wins this month. That has put them in a good position to challenge for the Absa Premiership title and the players now seem to playing all out for their coach.Key players such as Siphiwe Tshabalala, Willard Katsande and Bernard Parker have come to the party and their improved form is showing through the goals they ve score. Parker has scored three in the last four matches, while Tshabalala and Katsande have netted in Chiefs last two matches against Free State Stars and Maritzburg United. Komphela admitted he is thrilled to see the trio s improved performances, which bodes well for the team going forward. It tells you how focused they are and in fact what I was saying in one of my interviews is that whatever Shabba is eating, it must have been an overdose because he seemed to be hitting another level, Komphela said. Shabba is very exciting going forward and it s nice to see the experienced players taking responsibility and leading from the front. There are no standards in terms of reaching a certain level, we just keep on going. Growth is not only technical or tactical, gained not only from results but also from confidence. Our supporters must be happy, and all that we want is to win every match that comes our way. Komphela will be hoping the team extends their rich vein of form against struggling Highlands Park at Moses Mabhida stadium on Saturday. They will be looking to make it five wins out of five and keep the pressure on the log leaders.nevillek@thenewage.co.za-Neville Khoza
