There have been mixed reactions on Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa saying the government s plan to save jobs in the mining sector is starting to bear fruit.He was fielding questions in the National Assembly on Wednesday when ANC MP Joanmariae Fubbs asked if the government s initiative in the mining sector would achieve the objective of saving jobs.Yesterday the Forum for Service Delivery questioned why Ramaphosa thinks the government s plan is doing well when mining companies are still shutting down jobs.Ramaphosa said: Mining still remains a priority sector. We believe the sector retains the great potential to create jobs and to contribute to our national wealth. The plans in place for mining are beginning to bear fruit. Mining production increased to 4.6% year-on-year in February this year. Statistics South Africa recently reported that, compared to previous years, job losses in the mining sector have slowed down substantially in the last quarter of 2016. The 2017 employment numbers show that the mining sector is thus far making a positive contribution, he said.He said inclusive growth is needed to raise employment. We need to change the structure of our economy and demonstrate that if we have start-ups and new entrants in our economy, we should be able to stimulate competition and therefore growth. We need more regional growth and better integration to grow our value chains. We need to work with all social partners to rebuild confidence and to stabilise our state-owned enterprises. Reducing red tape and the cost associated with starting new businesses is beginning to work. In unlocking our Oceans Economy, Operation Phakisa has unlocked investments estimated at R24.6bn with the government contributing R15bn to this, he said.The Forum for Service Delivery says it will robustly engage with the government to put a lid on job losses.news@thenewage.co.za
