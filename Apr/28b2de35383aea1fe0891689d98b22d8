Finance Minster Malusi Gigaba has asserted that he is the Minister and that his advisors do not impose their counsel on him.His statement comes in light of comments made by his advisor Professor Chris Malikane where he advocated for, among other things, the nationalisation of banks, nationalisation of the SA Reserve Bank and expropriation of land without compensation.Gigaba was speaking during a press conference on Wednesday before heading to the US for the forthcoming International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank spring meetings, his first international trip since being installed as Finance Minister.&#8220;Advisors are advisors; they are not the Minister. They don&#8217;t impose their advise on the minister they only provide technical advice,&#8221; said Gigaba.Gigaba on Wednesday again distanced himself and National Treasury from the comments made by Prof. Malikane in a article titled &#8220;Our Chance to Complete the Revolution.&#8221;&#8220;Prof Malikane is an academic&#8230;and he is an advisor and not the Minister. I am the Minister, I am my own man and take my own decisions.&#8220;The technical advice he provides will never detract from the policies of the African National Congress, which don&#8217;t entail wholesale nationalisation of mines and the insurance industries the land,&#8221; said Gigaba.Gigaba conceded that while Malikane&#8217;s views have caused concern, he was a capable advisor adding that he holds a PhD in economics and that he is &#8220;not a Zama Zama&#8221;.Meanwhile Gigaba said that he will be meeting with ratings agency Moody&#8217;s while on his trip and he plans to brief them on a number of issues in order to instill renewed confidence in South Africa as an investment destination.&#8220;I will raise with Moody&#8217;s the programme for structural reform in the economy in the form of the 9 point plan and the various aspects we are implementing related to industrialisation, supporting the emergence of black industrialists, the beneficiation programmes supporting agro-processing, the issues of tele-communications and communications infrastructure and policies.&#8220;We will also brief them on the programmes we are implementing with regard to supporting rural and township economies,&#8221; said Gigaba.Earlier this month, Moody s placed South Africa on review for downgrade following President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s cabinet reshuffle.Gigaba also announced that he will meet with the German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch uble who heads up the G20 for a meet and greet session.The Finance Minister also announced that a new Director-General would be in place by May. This follows an announcement that current Director General Lungisa Fuzile will be leaving the department next month.&#8220;We are going to look for someone who is competent and we encourage internal candidates to apply,&#8221; said Gigaba.Siphiwe Mchunu
