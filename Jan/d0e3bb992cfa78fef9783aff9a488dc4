The mining industry in South Africa and the continent in general has continued to face significant uncertainty, volatility and pressure to contain costs over the past three years. This is according to KPMG s 2016 Mining Reporting Survey, released last week.The results of the survey are based on the reporting by 25 major mining companies worldwide, including Glencore, Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Anglo American The Survey is a bi-annual publication which looks at reporting trends in the mining industry as well as common business practices.It represents an analysis of the reporting of 25 industryleading, global mining firms and noted that evolving business environment that the mining industry has continued to face over the last several years has had a significant impact on reporting in the industry. Against that backdrop the report also looks at specific examples of how industry-leading firms are treating various aspects of reporting. This latest Mining Reporting Survey focuses on, namely estimates and judgments, valuation, Non GAAP measures, risks and other reporting trends, said Jacques Erasmus, global head of mnining for KPMG in South Africa. The report said this unpredictable business environment prompted the all the reporting trends which were geared towards providing stakeholders and users of mining companies financial statements a more transparent view of a company s position.Data shows that there was an increase in alternative forms of financing, such as streaming. Since KPMG s survey two years ago, there had in fact been a five-fold increase (30% of all companies) in the number of companies which disclosed that they had entered into streaming arrangements and that continued to enhance disclosures about such arrangements.Erasmus told media that this year s survey focused on five key areas, namely estimates and judgments, non-generally accepted accounting principles (non GAAP) measures, risks, valuation and other reporting trends. According to Erasmus the disclosures in these areas were becoming increasingly prevalent, as companies try to provide stakeholders with supplemental information on various risks impacting their businesses and disclosure of the critical judgments and estimates management is required to make in managing and mitigating.Erasmus told the media that there were a further three areas, namely that of mineral reserves and resources, which were disclosed by 91% of surveyed companies; reclamation provisions, which were disclosed by 96% of surveyed companies and depreciation, depletion and amortisation, which were disclosed by 87% of surveyed companies The report comes at a time in South Africa; mining operations are increasingly finding it difficult to survive.Their challenges were exacerbated by cost increases well above the inflation rate, including the cost of electricity, which has trebled over the past eight years Wages and the cost of storage and materials have been rising by 10% a year over the past five years and steel costs have risen by at least 12% a year.All these factors have led to the significant loss of about 60000 jobs in the South African mining sector from 2012 to 2015, according to the SA Chamber of Mines.-Samuel Mungadze|samuelm@thenewage.co.za
