I will not be deterred by false reports on social media, said controversial dancer Zodwa Wabantu.Zodwa was responding to reports that stated that she has been banned from performing at the Harare International Carnival along with Brazilian and Cuban dancers on September 6.According to reports, Zimbabwean actress based in South Africa Anne Nhira wrote a letter that Zodwa was not welcome in Zimbabwe because she is not a Zimbabwean, she dresses scantily and she is a lesbian.In a letter written by Nhira, The government position is that the artist concerned, Zodwa Wabantu, may not participate at the Harare International Carnival. In this regard, relevant authorities have been notified. When you hear Zodwa Wabantu is coming to Zimbabwe Carnival and you plead with God to send you back for a while pic.twitter.com/vqzzJvQ1ba Lone_Wolf (@soprano_7) August 31, 2017#AnneNhira trying to turn #ZodwaWabantu into a Zodwa WoBuntu. #Bhrugwa @263Chat @Trends_SADC Dumis (@zwBabbage) August 31, 2017@AnneNhira you went out of your way 2 derail another artist @Zodwa_Wabantu , we all artists of an African continent, let her be Ray Mupats (@raymupats) August 31, 2017So thanks to @Zodwa_Wabantu nemwana uya asina kurairwa @AnneNhira u learnt a new word yesterday &#8220;Chinyarikani&#8221; Cptn Nigel No Beard (@TafadzwaNigel) August 31, 2017During an interview, Zodwa said that she hasn&#8217;t received any news that she has been banned from performing at the Carnival.&#8220;You know I haven&#8217;t received any thing. I got a call from journalists asking me about the petition letter. But on my side, we are still negotiating because yesterday they asked about my passport via Afrotainment and they also confirmed that we are still going forward with the plans,&#8221; said Zodwa.She added, &#8220;I think that letter is just a letter. Maybe that woman (Anne Nhira) has connections with some people who started the whole petition against me.&#8221;Zodwa also indicated that she lives her life by her own rules.Then abazali bathi education is the key to success but Zodwa Wabantu is living life by wiggling her leg pic.twitter.com/Ts4X99QTkd Minenhle Dladla (@KMDladla25) August 26, 2017-TNA Reporter
