The Competition Tribunal will resume hearings on the Competition Commission s formal application to separate the exception applications brought in the matter of the forex trading scandal in which at least 17 banks have been implicated.The tribunal had initially proposed that any exception applications brought be argued thematically over at least two days. However following this direction, the tribunal received a formal request by the commission to argue these exceptions in separated hearings. Banks implicated in the forex trading scandal filed exception applications disputing their involvement in manipulating the rand and rigging bids.The 17 banks implicated were urged by the Competition Commission to come forward with a response to the case, disputing or accepting their involvement in the cartel. The forex manipulation scandal came to light when the Competition Commission unearthed a staggering case of collusion among 17 banks to manipulate the dollar-rand and collude on prices for bids, offers and bid offer spreads for the spot trades.The commission describes the process of collusion as coordinated through agreements made to refrain from trading and creating fictitious bids and offers at particular times, therefore manipulating offers and prices of bids. The Competition Tribunal said that banks that had filed the exceptions include Investec, Standard New York Securities, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, BNP Paribas, Commerzbank AG, Macquaerie Bank, HSBC Bank, Bank of America Merril Lynch International and Nomura International.The 17 banks initially implicated in the forex scandal included Bank of America Merril Lynch International, BNP Paribas, JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co, JP Chase Bank, Investec, Standard New York Securities, Standard Chartered Bank, HSBC Bank, Credit Suisse Group, Standard Bank of SA, Commerzbank AG, Australia and New Zealand banking group, Nomura International, Macquarie bank, Absa Bank, Barclays Capital and Barclays Bank. -THELMA NGOMA|thelman@thenewage.co.za
