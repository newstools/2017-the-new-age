The ANC in the Free state has resolved to hold its Provincial General Council (PGC) from 6 to 8 December after a court ruling o Wednesday said 29 of its Branch General Meetings (BGMs) were invalid. On Tuesday, the ANC in the Free State announced Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma as its preferred presidential candidate. On Wednesday, the Free State High Court ordered that the provincial ANC’s elective conference could not go ahead until BGMs, which were declared unlawful, are re-run. Provincial ANC spokesperson Thabo Meeko said the party has noted the ruling. “We note with deep concern the verdict of the high court regarding the ordering of the re-run of 29 BGMs before the provincial conference.” Meeko said, as the ANC, they would respect the decision of the court. He said even though the party was disappointed with the court’s decision, members were not surprised. “We also note that the ruling of the court was not unusual because the National Executive Committee (NEC) task team dealing with disputes also ordered re-runs of some BGMs.” Meeko said processes were being undertaken by the ANC to address concerns related to disputes countrywide, adding that internal processes of the ANC were enough to deal with any challenge. He also condemned the party’s deputy chairperson Thabo Manyoni for supporting actions that sought to resolve ANC disputes outside. Manyoni is expected to contest the chairmanship of the party with long-serving chairman Ace Magashule. Meeko urged all ANC structures to stay focused and understanding as the party in the province is preparing for the elective conference in December.  -TNA Reporter
