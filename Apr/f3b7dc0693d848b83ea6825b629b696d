Nothing builds up hype for an athletics event quite like the stars themselves. In the lead-up to the keenly-awaited SA Senior Athletics Championships in Potchefstroom this weekend, Olympic medallists and record holders took to social media in a bantering fashion to raise the profile of the meet.It is clearly the most hyped and anticipated athletics event the country has seen in years and it will be nothing short of exciting as young speedsters Gift Leotlela and Clarence Munyai are eager to steal the show against Olympic medallists and established runners such as Wayde van Niekerk, Caster Semenya, Akani Simbine, Anaso Jobodwana and Henricho Bruintjies.Eyes will be on the 100m and 200m events where Van Niekerk and Simbine will be up against emerging sprinters Leotlela and Thando Roto. The national broadcaster will televise the event via live streaming and a delayed broadcast on SABC2.-Kgomotso Sethusha|kgomotsos@thenewage. co.za
