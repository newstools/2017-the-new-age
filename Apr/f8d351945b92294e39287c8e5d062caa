Rafael Nadal claimed a record-extending 10th Monte Carlo Masters title as he geared up for his beloved French Open with a 6-1 6-3 victory against fellow Spaniard Albert Ramos on Sunday.The fourth seed, who is also targeting a 10th Roland Garros trophy this year, was always in command as he claimed his first ATP title since triumphing in Barcelona a year ago.The 14-times grand slam champion had won his two previous encounters against Ramos and the 15th seed failed to snap that run on Sunday.&#8220;It has been an amazing week on one of the most important events on the tour. I played well here, which helps me a lot to start the claycourt season with confidence,&#8221; said Nadal.Nadal wasted three break points in the second game as Ramos levelled for 1-1, only for the claycourt king to win the next five games to bag the opening set.With Nadal&#8217;s topspin working with devastating effect, Ramos struggled to stay close to his baseline.The Mallorcan broke for 3-2 in the second set when Ramos sent a backhand long and from then on Nadal was unstoppable.Ramos ended his first Masters final with a double fault that handed Nadal his 70th ATP title on the third match point.-Reuters
