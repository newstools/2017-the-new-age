The deadlock between forensic pathologists and the department of health has seen families being turned away when coming to collect the bodies of their loved ones.Social activist Yusuf Abramjee said many religions demand that burials take place immediately. I just got calls from members of the Muslim community who are thinking of bringing an urgent high court application to force the MEC to release the bodies and to get the post-mortems done. It might not affect court cases but it is causing trauma for families, he said.This as forensic pathologists, represented by Nehawu, say they refuse to conduct autopsies as they are not trained to do them.A meeting between the officers and the provincial head of department Dr Ernest Kenoshi took place on Monday.This was in a bid to restore forensic pathology services at the province s mortuaries.The department said it had reaffirmed the commitment made by MEC Gwen Ramokgopa that counselling and debriefing sessions will be reinstated for use by employees.An audit of critical equipment and protective clothing will be conducted with immediate effect and the implementation of a danger allowance for qualifying employees will take effect.Nehawu, however, says the deadlock is still about the issue of forcing people to perform autopsies they are not trained to perform. They must speak to issues that are within their competency. Those issues are before the bargaining council andwe are awaiting their response, Xaba said.LERATO DIALE, MPHO KOBELI AND MASEGO TIRO
