Parents who tried to secure space for their children before the official launch of the 2018 online admissions will have to apply again as any earlier attempt will be declared invalid, the department of education has said.Applications are expected to open from today until midnight on June 12. We have noted that some parents have already applied before the stipulated admissions period. Such parents should note that their application is invalid and they should log on again (from today), department spokesperson Oupa Bodibe said.Last week education MEC Panyaza Lesufi announced a number of changes to the online admissions systems, following glitches experienced when it was launched last year. Lesufi said the website would now be an interactive and easy website so that people can go through it without difficulty . The upgrades introduced include the use of multiple languages. If you want to enrol your child using your language of preference the option will be available on the system. The system will also accommodate foreign children who would like to learn in Gauteng schools. Once the application process has been completed, home affairs will assist us in taking out all fraudulent ID numbers. The system also has support for informal settlements, Lesufi said.The enrolment for grades 1 and 8 for 2018 is projected to be more than 366383, a 2.5% increase.Placements are expected to begin in July and run until September, to ensure there are enough teachers and material for 2018. Parents will receive SMS notifications or a letter from the school notifying them about the status.LILLIAN SELAPISAlillians@thenewage.co.za
