Eskom has on Wednesday said they were about 27 companies who have shown an interest into the proposed 9.6 GW Nuclear New Build Programme.The utility said all the 27 companies intend to provide a response to the Request for Information (RFI).The deadline for the response to the RFI is set up for the 28 April 2017. It is reported that among companies that intended to provide request included bidders from China (SNPTC), France (EDF), Russia (Rosatom) and South Korea (Kepco).Eskom s procurement process started in December last year, when it launched the RFI process. Two requests for proposals (RFPs) are still due to be released this year. While the intention to submit a response to Eskom s RFI does not commit a company to submit a response to a potential future RFP, the quantum of the response to Eskom s RFI shows the level of competitive interest in the South African Nuclear New Build Programme, Eskom said.The utility s CEO Matshela Koko said Eskom was looking forward to the information supplied to confirm the understanding of the key issues that impacted on the timing and affordability of a nuclear program.According to Eskom the RFI is done in order to source information which may assist with the preparation of future competitive tender/enquiry relating to the new nuclear build programme.The release of the RFI is the first step in the ultimate appointment of one or more specialist suppliers who will work with the South African team in constructing the new fleet of nuclear power stations.The programme aims to procure generation capacity to ensure energy security and facilitate achievement of greenhouse gas emissions targets.-Sipho Jack
