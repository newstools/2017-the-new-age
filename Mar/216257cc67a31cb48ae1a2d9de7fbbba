With just nine days to go to and as the Gauteng health department scrambles to transfer mental patients from NGOs to suitable facilities, health MEC Gwen Ramokgopa is confident the health ombudsman s deadline would be met.She assured the public yesterday that her department was working hard to meet the timelines set by health ombudsman Prof Malegapuru Makgoba in the wake of the tragedy in which at least 100 patients died after being relocated to NGOs from the Life Esidimeni hospital.Speaking at a briefing at Clinix Selby Park Hospital in Johannesburg, Ramokgopa said it was important that the patients were transferred in a safe and dignified manner.A total of 763 patients remain in the NGOS while 63 have already been moved.The department said 34 patients were transferred, 28 from Rebafenyu NGO while six were from Kopanong hospital. The department has appointed Clinix Selby Park Hospital and Life Esidimeni for the intake of patients.The MEC said the department paid R495 per patient at the facilities.Ramokgopa said social workers were facing challenges in reaching family members of some of the patients about the relocation. Of the patients families contacted in preparation for the transfers, 33 were successfully reached. The social workers report showed that there was a positive response by families to the relocation processes due to the close proximity of the facilities to their homes, Ramokgopa said.She said in cases where families were not reachable, the help of social services and home affairs will be sought. Ramokgopa assured the public of the safety of the patients who still remained at the NGOs saying a team of medical doctor s were assessing them on a daily basis. We have a team of doctors and nurses who assess the patient daily and report back to us, she said.The MEC said the tragedy happened because officials working on the project were working in their own silo, however, moving forward this will be rectified.Ramokgopa has reiterated her statement that the process will not be rushed in a bid to prevent a repeat of the deadly Esidimeni transfers and the chaos that ensued following the transfers.LERATO DIALEleratod@thenewage.co.za
