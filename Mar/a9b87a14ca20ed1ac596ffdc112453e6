Egypt said on Saturday it would resume importing meat from Brazil after a brief suspension following allegations that exporters in the Latin American country had sold tainted beef and poultry.&#8220;We suspended it (this week) until we found out what happened and now it&#8217;s back, but we won&#8217;t import anything from slaughter houses or factories that have a problem,&#8221; said Mona Mehrez, a deputy to the agriculture minister.Brazilian meat exports were worth $63 million a day until last week&#8217;s announcement by police of &#8220;Operation Weak Flesh,&#8221; which revealed that some meatpackers had paid crooked inspectors to pass off rotten and adulterated meat as safe.Brazil&#8217;s government had appealed Wednesday to the World Trade Organization&#8217;s (WTO) 163 other members not to impose &#8220;arbitrary&#8221; bans on the country&#8217;s more than $13 billion meat export industry.-AFP
