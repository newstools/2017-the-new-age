Ebrahim Rasool, the first ANC premier in the Western Cape, is back in the hurly-burly world of politics, not on a comeback trail, but as part of an intervention to revitalise the party.Western Cape ANC secretary Faiez Jacobs told the media yesterday that Rasool, formerly South Africa s ambassador to the US, spoke at the provincial executive lekgotla held at the weekend.His message was on forging unity, ending factionalism and of the ANC in the Western Cape regaining its moral compass. That message resonated well for us. We need to return to our branches. If we humble ourselves and serve our people our people will give us another opportunity, Jacobs said.Calling on Rasool s expertise, he said, was part of a strategy to harness the skills of former provincial leaders such as Chris Nissen and James Ngculu. He is back in the province. He is a signed-up member. This is not comeback. There is no sinister motif. We don t want you to read anything into it. Ebrahim is part of our legacy: what we call a council of elders. He is back for good in the Western Cape. He still has international responsibilities. We re also talking to national (leadership) to see how he could be used (effectively), added Jacobs.Asked about Rasool s own battles with other ANC members when he was premier, Jacobs said: We can t deny the fact that we have a history of divisions. We need to see how we improve management of ourselves. We remember when we managed ourselves better. Jacobs called for the building of non racialism and unity between African and coloured communities in the province.However, Marius Fransman, once closely associated with Rasool s leadership in the province, is still out in the cold.Fransman, who served as chairperson of the ANC in the Western Cape, has had his membership suspended for five years by the ANC disciplinary committee following allegations of sexual harassment. He has appealed against this sentence.-DENNIS CRUYWAGEN
