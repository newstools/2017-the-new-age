Local musicians Kwesta and Zakes Bantwini have come out guns blazing accusing music stable Mabala Noise of unprofessional treatment following their cancelled Durban July performances at the weekend.The two artists were among artists booked to perform at the official Durban July launch concert at Greyville Racecourse on Friday, which preceded the 121st instalment of the annual horse racing extravaganza the next day.On hearing that they had 15 minutes to perform the stars left fans shocked as they refused to perform. They then took the matter to social media where they complained bitterly about the unprofessional treatment they said they received at the hands of the label. I would like to apologise to everyone that came to Greyville racecourse to see me at the Mabala Noise event. Business wasn t handled right, Sama award-winning rapper Kwesta, said on Twitter.In a series of Twitter posts, Bantiwni vented against the label s lack of respect for artists and said it handled the matter unprofessionally. As many of you have asked, the reason why I did not get to perform my new album at the event was because there was a lack of professionalism and communication and disrespect was displayed by the Mabala Noise team, Bantwini said. It s my first time being subjected to this ordeal and to think that we as the industry are treating each other like this is appalling. While we as the industry fight to be respected we cannot allow a fellow record label to show us the middle finger.Mabala Noise, be rest assured I will never allow you or anyone to disrespect my hard earned career. The label s spokesperson, Mhlo Gumede, said it was regrettable that the two stars could not stick to the agreed 15 minute allocated time, which he said was communicated to them prior. The label apologised to both artists who chose not to perform, he said.news@thenewage.co.za
