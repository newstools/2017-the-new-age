A 43-year-old man is due to appear at Umlazi Magistrate court on Thursday for unlawful discharge of a firearm, possession of unlicensed firearm and ammunition.The man was arrested yesterday outside Umlazi L Community hall where the memorial service of alleged gang leader Sandile Chillies Bhengu was taking place.According to police, he is linked to a number of cash-in-transit and robberies committed in the province.KwaZulu-Natal police have deployed more officers in Umlazi township ahead the funeral of Bhengu, who was shot by police last week.&#8220;The deployment follows messages that emerged on social media that criminals were encouraged to hijack vehicles and attack police due to the recent killing of a gang leader in Umlazi.&#8220;We will continue our operations until the gang leader is buried, we will not tolerate people who want to take the law into their own hands and cause panic in our communities,&#8221; said KZN police spokesperson Thembeka Mbhele.Mbhele also discourages community members from idolising criminals and joining them when they fire shots into the air and spin cars as these inadvertently can lead to the death of bystanders.Last night no serious injuries were reported due to the high police visibility in the area.Sandile Chillies Bhengu is no hero, his death is a huge relief, a lawless thug, who terrorised the community Spha Ntokozo Mbatha (@Ntokozo_Shandu) September 7, 2017 thanks! at least it looks like Sandile #Chillies Bhengu enjoyed his life of crime! i for one am happy it&#8217;s come to an end !
