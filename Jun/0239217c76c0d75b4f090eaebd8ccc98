The head of Uganda&#8217;s football association Moses Magogo said Tuesday he was under investigation by FIFA over his alleged involvement in the illegal sale of 2014 World Cup tickets.According to a letter sent from FIFA to Magogo that was seen by AFP, the football chief is accused of selling the complementary tickets allocated to Uganda.&#8220;We got the communication from FIFA on the allegations raised and my legal team is handling the matter,&#8221; Magogo told AFP, confirming he was under investigation.The probe comes after Ugandan lawmaker Allan Ssweanyana &#8212; who also co-owns a local football club &#8212; petitioned FIFA in May, accusing Magogo of selling all 177 tickets allocated to Uganda to an agent in the United States.Magogo, who has been in office for five years, is set to have his term extended after the football governing body on Tuesday disqualified his lone challenger for his post in August 5 elections.-AFP
