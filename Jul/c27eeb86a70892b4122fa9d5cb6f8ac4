The provincial South African Local Government Association (Salga), will commemorate Nelson Mandela International Day by providing for the less fortunate in Kuruman.A collaboration between different stakeholders will be spending the day and dedicating their 67 minutes under the theme Action against Poverty.Modibedi Mongwe of Salga said poverty was crippling the country and was at the forefront of most of the social ills. We have to, as a collective, take aggressive action against poverty. Each of us can make every day a Mandela Day by volunteering to do something sustainable that will help South Africa eradicate poverty and ensure that we all realise the ideal of a dignified life, Mongwe said. Whether you provide health services or products, education, sports, financial planning, capacity building, communications, action against poverty means different actions for various people in different sectors based on the service offerings, he said.Mongwe said that, among other things, they would be handing out dignity packs to both girls and boy pupils at Bagalotlhare High School with the intention of restoring their dignity. We will be donating books to the school library in order to promote the culture of learning and starting up basic food gardens for indigent community members as a means for sustainable food provision, he said.Mongwe said to enhance the culture of starting their own vegetable gardens they would also donate equipment to the pupils. We are also going to donate gardening tools to be used for their maintenance. The disabled, child-headed households and the elderly will receive donations of 50 blankets as well as registration of late births and smart cards. Salga said they were partnering with different stakeholders such as John Taolo Gaetsewe district and Joe Morolong local municipalities, the departments of Home Affairs, Public Works and Roads and Social Development among others.Mongwe said the activities would take place in the Heunningvlei area and private companies such as Assmang Manganese and Kumba Iron Ore were also in partnership.Meanwhile, the MEC of transport, safety and liaison Pauline Williams will also be in Kuruman to visit households and hand over temporary shelters.Spokesperson of the MEC Patsy Alley said Williams would also distribute Shova Kalula bicycles and be involved in the tagging of donkeys and branding of donkey carts to curb high accidents in the area.The Gamagara municipality started their Mandela Day activities through the mayoral outreach programme in Kathu on Friday.The manager in the office of the mayor Kamogelo Semamai said it was all systems go with the intention of changing the lives of ordinary people.He said the mayor, Dineo Moyo, pledged her support in changing the lives of the community of Gamagara during her budget vote earlier this year.
