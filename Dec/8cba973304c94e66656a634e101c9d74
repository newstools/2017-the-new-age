DISGRACED retail giant Steinhoff has appointed a new CEO amid its troubles and catastrophic financial loss. Danie van der Merwe, who had been COO of Steinhoff, is now acting CEO. Van der Merwe replaced the group’s CEO Markus Jooste, who is embroiled in a scandal involving “accounting irregularities” in their financial results for 2016 and 2017. Steinhoff last week admitted that its 2016 financial results were unreliable and will have to be restated. The board also nominated two additional members, Alexandre Nodale as deputy CEO and Louis du Preez as commercial director. Nodale is set to bring additional financial oversight and European retail experience to the Management Board. He will remain CEO of Conforama, a major subsidiary of Steinhoff. Du Preez is a qualified attorney specialising in corporate and commercial matters. Following these nominations the board will consist of Danie van der Merwe, acting CEO, Alexandre Nodale, deputy CEO, Ben la Grange CFO and Louis du Preez, commercial director. The nominations will be submitted to the general meeting for appointment in due course. The group yesterday was set to meet with bankers in London. In these meetings, Steinhoff says it normally provides the bankers with information about the published financial statements and also provided certain information pertaining to the Steinhoff Europe Group’s budget for the year ahead. This might prove to be a challenge this year since the company revealed that its financial results could no longer be relied on as they were cooked up and packaged as authentic. The company has not yet disclosed the outcome of the meeting with bankers. -THELMA NGOMA|thelman@thenewage.co.za
