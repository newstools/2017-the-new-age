Families of ten of the PAC members killed during the apartheid era will finally have closure when their remains are exhumed from graves in Mamelodi soon.The activists were hanged for their political activities in Paarl, Western Cape.No specific dates have been given for the exhumations.The men were members of the armed wing of the PAC, Poqo. They were hanged during the period 1963 to 1967. Their bodies were declared the property of the state and were given paupers burials.One resistance protest of the period culminated in a mass night time march on the white town of Paarl in November 1962 in which two whites were killed.The Madikana family from the Eastern Cape said yesterday that they were grateful to finally take home their beloved Lennox Mngambi Madikane who was 25 years at the time he was hanged on November 1, 1963.Madikane was buried in the same grave with Vezile Jaxa and Mxolisi Damane at Mamelodi West Cemetery.Madikane s grandson Siyanda Madikana said as black families it is important for the remains of a dead person to come back home and now the family will find closure. We did not think we would have ever seen his remains and this means a lot to us. He must be buried with all our loved ones, he said.Madikana said it pains him that what his grandfather fought for was not being celebrated. The politicians who are honoured are the ones who are still alive but not the ones who have died. I do not need money from the government but I need for him to be honoured as someone who contributed to the struggle for freedom, he said.These exhumations form part of the Gallows Exhumation Project launched by Justice Minister Michael Masutha last year, aimed at recovering the remains of 130 political prisoners who were hanged prior to the suspension of the death penalty in 1990.nondumisoz@thenewage.co.za
