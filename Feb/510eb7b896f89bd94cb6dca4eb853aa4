Another tough budget is likely this afternoon as the Treasury looks to cover a shortfall of R28bn for the fiscal year.Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan could offer up some big surprises and given the earnings gap between rich and poor it seems likely the wealthier will be squeezed a little harder.The biggest chunk of tax revenue (40%) is derived from personal income tax (PIT), followed by 26% from value added tax (VAT), with companies contributing just 20%.Inflation has grown in the past two years, exacerbated by the drought, which pushed the CPI inflation rate above the Reserve Bank s target of 3-6%. In December, inflation hit 6.8%, while earnings remain flat.Experts have warned consumers must tighten their belts again as tax hikes are likely to hit them one way or another. The Treasury needs to find savings through fiscal discipline, something credit ratings agencies will have their eye on.Azar Jammine, chief economist at Econometrix, said: Raising the VAT rate would be one of the most efficient forms of raising tax given that there is very little scope for evasion. However, it is a tax not only on the rich and is politically sensitive. Jammine said personal tax focused on the top earners. Capital gains tax, the fuel levy and sin taxes will be where Gordhan will be fishing.Prof Andr Roux, economist at the University of Stellenbosch Business School, said the usual increase in sin tax and the proposed sugar tax would not be sufficient. The most efficient mechanism would be a one percentage point increase in the VAT rate, which could yield an additional R15bn-R20bn. Failing this, the brunt of the higher tax burden is bound to fall on the private sector. He said the challenge, therefore, is to budget for a modest increase in public spending that favours the poor, without raising the public debt to a level that would trigger a credit downgrade.Bernard Sathekge | bernards@thenewage.co.za
