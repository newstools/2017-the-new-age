The South Gauteng High Court has on Wednesday ordered an unlawfully operating church in Yeoville to stop operation.This follows numerous complaints by residents complaining about the extreme pandemonium from the church daily.The court interdicted that Selvan Crole Marcelle, also known as Pastor Elijah Tenkwee from using the property for any purpose other than a dwelling and that the property may not be used as a place of worship.It is reported that the church operated in contravention of City by-laws relating to building and land use. News of the church s illegal operation was brought to the City s Building Development Management Department (BDM) in November 2016.City of Johannesburg Executive Mayor Herman Mashaba said he met the community of Yoeville in March to discuss this matter.&#8220;I and the MMC for Development Planning, Cllr Funzela Ngobeni, were invited to a meeting organised by members of the Yoeville community in March this year in order to discuss the matter.&#8220;Upon inspection of several alleged illegal churches in the area, I was shocked and dismayed to discover that churches were operating in residential dwellings that had been converted to house these churches,&#8221; said Mashaba.The operations of the church often resulted loud music being played into the early hours of the morning disturbing the peace of residents in the area.Mashaba says today s court ruling is a victory for the community of Yoeville and indeed, the rule of law in our city.TNA Reporter
