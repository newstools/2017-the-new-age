THE University of Johannesburg (UJ) has agreed to broaden its global search among highly qualified academics as it works to identify a capable successor to the vice-chancellor and principal, Prof Ihron Rensburg. The new vice-chancellor and principal is expected to take office in January next year.The UJ s specially constituted selection committee convened yesterday, tasking the university s human resources department and the executive search organisation assisting it with widening the net before a short list can be presented to the university council.This is due to take place in March following an internal consultation process, which will see the short-listed candidates presented to council for consideration, after which these candidates will undergo fitness-for-purpose assessments, make presentations to the senate and the institutional forum, and participate in an interview with the university selection panel.It is expected that council would make the final appointment at its June meeting. Because UJ has under Prof Rensburg s leadership made such enormous strides in transforming and becoming more accessible, while significantly improving quality and standards academically, we are determined to identify and win for the university an individual of exceptional ability, council chair Prof Roy Marcus said. The exhaustive international search process has thus far identified a number of excellent candidates for the long list discussed today, but the search committee felt that further effort was necessary to ensure only the very best candidates are put forward, thereby ensuring that the shortlist and the ongoing process will bring forth an exceptional leader as we move into the future, Marcus said.Rensburg was appointed to his current position in 2006, soon after the formation of the university through an amalgamation of the former Rand Afrikaans University, the Soweto campus of Vista University, and the Technikon Witwatersrand. Driving transformation and academic excellence, he has played a decisive role in ensuring that the new institution has rapidly become much more than simply the sum of its parts. UJ was placed among the top 4% of universities globally in the prestigious QS World University Rankings for 2014/15, and it is now considered Africa s leading comprehensive university despite not having a medical school, he said.-NTOMBI NKOSIntombin@thenewage.co.za
