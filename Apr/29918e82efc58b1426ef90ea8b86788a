A Hong Kong technician was jailed for four years and nine months on Monday for rioting and arson during anti-China protests last year, in the harshest punishment yet over the unrest.The case is the latest in a slew of legal action against demonstrators and comes soon after new pro-Beijing leader Carrie Lam was selected as leader of the semi-autonomous city.Yeung Ka-lun, 32, was pictured in news footage torching a taxi during the February 2016 unrest, which tapped into fears that Beijing is tightening its grip on Hong Kong.During clashes dubbed the &#8220;fishball revolution&#8221;, police fired warning shots in the air, while demonstrators hurled bricks torn up from pavements, charged police lines with homemade shields and set rubbish on fire.&#8220;The court must send a message that these acts cannot be tolerated,&#8221; said a judge at the Hong Kong court, in justifying the sentencing.He said protesters shared a goal to disrupt social order and had threatened public safety.While Yeung had no previous criminal records, he was &#8220;extremely reckless&#8221; in setting fire to the car in a crowded urban area, the judge added.Outside the court, the acting superintendent of the organized crime bureau said, &#8220;police believe that the sentence has sufficiently reflected the seriousness and gravity of the offences.&#8221;A small number of supporters sat in on the hearing and expressed outrage over the sentence.Last month three activists were jailed for three years on &#8220;riot&#8221; charges for their role in the same protests.Like Yeung, they were not well-known campaigners.The riot&#8217;s alleged ringleaders from &#8220;localist&#8221; campaign group Hong Kong Indigenous, which advocates more autonomy for the city, face trial next year.Nine pro-democracy activists including students, professors and lawmakers were separately accused of causing a public nuisance or inciting others to do so during the 2014 mass Umbrella Movement rallies, in a case they have criticised as political persecution.The government&#8217;s department of justice brought those charges just days after Lam was selected by a committee skewed towards the mainland camp.-AFP
