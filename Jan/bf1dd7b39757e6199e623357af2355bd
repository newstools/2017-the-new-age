As Neil Powell continues to feel the absence of Cecil Afrika and Kyle Brown for the next two tournaments in Wellington and Sydney, the Blitzbokke coach was excited to introduce uncapped Zain Davids to the national setup.The enterprising and mercurial Davids, who was one of the Junior Springboks star performers last year, is one of the two new players in Powell s team to travel to Oceania. The other is Siviwe Soyizwapi, who is yet to feature in the World Rugby Sevens Series this season.Their inclusions were forced by knee injuries to Kyle Brown and Cecil Afrika. Davids will replace Brown and Soyizwapi comes in for Afrika.Regulars Werner Kok, Dylan Sage, Roscko Speckman, Branco du Preez and Justin Geduld have all made the cut, while top try scorer Seabelo Senatla will be fit for the next two tournaments, which will be his last before joining the Stormers for the next Super Rugby season.Powell said he had been observing Davids for a while and was happy to blood him into the Blitzbokke squad. We have lost more than 100 tournaments worth of experience with Kyle and Cecil out of action. That said, we always knew that we needed to bring new players into the system and Zain was earmarked as one of them. He has shown a good appetite for sevens and will now be tested at the highest level, Powell said. Shakes (Soyizwapi) played for us last year and will be keen to establish himself in the side, especially as Seabelo Senatla will be moving to the 15s. He did very well in the warm-up tournament in Namibia late last year and I am pleased to have him in the playing squad, Powell said.While the Blitzbokke are leading the World Series after two tournaments, coach Powell has admitted that such numbers will not mean anything in the coming tournaments. We have a tough pool in Wellington but I am happy with the way the guys trained and came back from the break, Powell said.The Springbok Sevens are grouped with Olympic Games gold medallists Fiji, in Pool B, as well as Australia and Japan, their first opponent in the Westpac Stadium in Wellington.These tournaments, the third and fourth in the series, will be played in the New Zealand capital on January 28 and 29, and in Australia on February 4 and 5.Mmasekepe Matsebane |mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
