The Gauteng Education Department urged parents to keep their children at home today due to the national taxi strike.For the sake of the safety of the children the Department believes that all precautionary measures should be taken to keep our children safe, it said in a statement.This comes as Santaco blockaded roads in support of their action to draw attention to the high cost of taxi&#8217;s.The Department has urged all schools to give learners that could not make it today a second opportunity to write exams.&#8220;We understand that many schools are writing exams but assure parents that children that did not go to school today will be given a second opportunity,&#8221; GDE spokesperson Oupa Bodibe said.The Department has communicated to all school principals to give children that could not make it to school today another opportunity to write at a later stage.&#8220;In cases where children have made it to school safely the schools are urged to make a determination whether to continue with the exams that were scheduled today, subject to the condition that it is safe to do so.&#8221;&#8220;Let us all cooperate for the sake of our children,&#8221; he added.JHB &#8211; R21 North: #TaxiProtest ROAD CLOSED RT @RaraTheGreat @TrafficSA R21N at Olifantsfontein pic.twitter.com/OBk264QkYd&mdash; TrafficSA (@TrafficSA) June 15, 2017-TNA Reporter
