The father of a schoolgirl, Kelda Makwakwa, 12, who was knocked down by a police van on Wednesday in Alexandra was left fuming yesterday as he had not seen his daughters body.The girl was killed on her way home from school near the Pan African shopping mall.Calvin Makwakwa said he was prevented from seeing the body of his child at the mortuary and the only information he had received was from the police and bystanders.A health official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the victim s father needed to be taken for counselling before seeing the child. This is to protect him from further trauma, she said.Police spokesperson Col Lungelo Dlamini said a case of culpable homicide was being investigated and no arrests had been made.The distraught father yesterday told The New Age that he received a call from his wife to inform him about the accident. But I was not allowed to see my child while the crowd was watching. Since the accident I have not seen my child and I am angry because the police keep on postponing, telling me that they are doing tests. All I want is to see her body, Makwakwa said.He said he was locked inside a police van when he tried to reach the crime scene. He described his daughter as a smart child.The young girl was recently enrolled as a Grade 5 pupil at Eastridge Christian School in Alexandra, a private school in Gauteng.Eyewitness said the accident was horrific and the young child s brains were scattered on the road.The father said he has also requested to meet the police officer involved in the incident. I went to the police station to request to see the man who caused the accident and they told me they were going to organise that we meet. I understand it was an accident but I just need to speak to him and get closure. The child s mother has not left her bedroom since receiving news of her daughter s death.news@thenewage.co.za
