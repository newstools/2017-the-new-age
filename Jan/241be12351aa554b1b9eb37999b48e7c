A brilliant Benjamin Moukandjo free-kick was not enough for Cameroon to win their opening game at the Africa Cup of Nations on Saturday as Burkina Faso battled back to draw 1-1.Moukandjo, the Indomitable Lions captain, curled in a superb effort from a dead ball 10 minutes before the interval in the Group A game at the Stade de l&#8217;Amitie in Libreville.However, 2013 runners-up Burkina Faso recovered to equalise with quarter of an hour left, Issoufou Dayo bundling the ball in after Banou Diawara&#8217;s free-kick was saved.The result means there is nothing between any of the sides in Group A after hosts Gabon were held to a 1-1 draw by Guinea-Bissau in the tournament&#8217;s opening match earlier in the day.-AFP
