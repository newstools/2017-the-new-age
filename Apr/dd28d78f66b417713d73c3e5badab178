A war of words has broken out between National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete and opposition parties over the status of the no-confidence debate in President Jacob Zuma.Parliament said in terms of parliamentary rules, Mbete did not have the power to withdraw a motion on the matter. Parliament has received correspondence from the UDM and the EFF requesting the Speaker of the National Assembly to postpone the debate on the motion of no confidence in the President, pending the outcome of the Constitutional Court application for a secret ballot on the motion, Parliament said yesterday. Rule 128 of the National Assembly rules stipulates that withdrawals of motions may only be made by the MP in whose name they were tabled, Parliament said. The motion of no confidence, in line with the urgent request, is tabled under the name of the leader of the opposition, Mmusi Maimane, Parliament said. Therefore, in terms of the provision in the rules, only Maimane and not the Speaker has the power to withdraw the motion. However the DA yesterday hit back and accused Mbete of misleading the nation by ignoring its request to postpone the debate rather than withdrawing its request. The press statement by the Speaker of the National Assembly, Baleka Mbete, indicating that the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma can only be withdrawn by the MP that sponsors it, flat out ignores our request for the motion to be postponed.Indeed, the DA never indicated that the motion will be withdrawn but only requested that the Speaker postpone the motion due to the importance of the pending ConCourt application, the DA said. The rules clearly allow for it to be postponed. The DA will therefore not withdraw the leader of the opposition s motion of no confidence in President Zuma. The UDM has approached the ConCourt for direction on whether the vote on the no-confidence motion can be conducted through a secret balllot.Parliament has confirmed it will oppose a Constitutional Court application.Mbete has set the debate down for April 18 after requests from the opposition as part of widespread action sparked by Zuma s Cabinet reshuffle.TNA REPORTER
