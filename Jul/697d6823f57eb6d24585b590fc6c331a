A Kenyan court on Wednesday sentenced three men to life for stripping and sexually assaulting a woman they believed was dressed too provocatively.The verdict capped a case that prompted hundreds to march through the capital Nairobi in short, fitted clothing in 2014, calling for an end to violence against women after a video of the attack was made public.&#8220;We are equal, but it is equally important to respect the dignity of a woman,&#8221; chief magistrate Francis Andayi said as he handed out the sentences.&#8221;This is what many uncultured men do out there,&#8221; he added.The assault at a petrol station on Nairobi&#8217;s outskirts, in which the victim was stripped, sexually assaulted and had her phone and cash stolen by a violent mob, was captured on camera and widely circulated on social media.It was part of a rash of assaults against women and led activists mobilised under the hash tag #MyDressMyChoice to demonstrate.The three men, Edward Gitau, Nicholas Mwangi and Meshak Mwangi, were technically given the death sentence. However Kenya&#8217;s ban on carrying out executions means the trio will spend the rest of their lives in jail.-AFP
