Gordon Igesund or Allan Freese are likely to take over at Platinum Stars following the shock axing of Cavin Johnson as head coach yesterday.Dikwena revealed yesterday that Johnson s contract would not be renewed at the end of this month. Tt is now believed that management are lining up Igesund and Freese as his potential successors. Both Igesund and Freese are without employment after both were fired by Highlands Park at separate times. Freese has worked with Highlands Park in the past and guided them to two cup final successes in the MTN8 and Telkom Knockout, defeating Orlando Pirates on both occasions. Igesund and Freese have been mentioned and one of them could take over at the club, a source close to the situation said. Dikwena decided not to renew Johnson s contract following their poor performances in the CAF Confederation Cup group stages where they lost twice to Mbabane Swallows and CS Sfaxien while drawing the other match with MC Alger.They sit bottom of Group B with just a point from three matches, five behind leaders Sfaxien. They were thumped 3-0 by Sfaxien in Tunisia on Sunday in what was Johnson s final match with the club. We would like to move to another level. We believe that a change of this nature would bring someone who will take the club to another level. This is a contract not being renewed. It s not a firing or anything, Dikwena chairperson Cliff Ramoroa said in a statement.Ramoroa also revealed that there will be further changes to the technical team and playing personnel during the off season as they look to do better next campaign after missing out on a top eight finish this season.-NEVILLE KHOZA
