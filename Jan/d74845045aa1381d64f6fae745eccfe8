Tobacco control measures do not harm economies, contrary to claims by the tobacco industry.This is one of many findings contained in the report by the World Health Organisation and the National Cancer Institute of the US.The report has found that increasing prices of tobacco products and tax combined with policies to control tobacco use can generate revenue for health and development.The report says measures to control tobacco use can significantly reduce the use of tobacco and protect people from health consequences such as cancer and heart disease.The report comes after Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said last year the country plans to tighten tobacco laws, resulting in no branding, logos and colours on cigarette packs. It is estimated that 44000 South Africans die from smoking annually.The WHO says tobacco use is responsible for the deaths of 6 million people worldwide annually, the majority of whom live in developing countries.WHO assistant director-general for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and mental health Dr Oleg Chestnov described the economic impact of tobacco use on countries and the public as huge. The tobacco industry produces and markets products that kill millions of people prematurely, rob households of finances that could have been used for food and education, and impose immense healthcare costs on families, communities and countries. The tobacco industry was found to cost the world s economies more than $1 trillion (R14 trillion) annually in healthcare expenditure and lost productivity, according to the findings published in The Economics of Tobacco and Tobacco Control report.Key findings of the report include among others that tobacco control does not harm economies and that while effective policy and interventions to reduce demand for tobacco products, deaths, diseases and economic costs resulting from their use exist, these interventions remain under used.The report says the number of jobs dependent on tobacco has been falling in most countries due to technological innovation and privatisation of state-owned manufacturing and as a result, tobacco control measures will have a modest impact on employment.Other findings are that tobacco control reduces the disproportionate health and economic burden imposed by tobacco use on poor and vulnerable groups.The report also found that while progress was being made in controlling the global effects of tobacco, concerted efforts were needed to ensure progress is maintained and accelerated.Measures to reduce tobacco use have long been met with resistance by the tobacco industry, citing among other reasons, job losses.Dr Douglas Bettcher, WHO director for the prevention of NCDs said the report gives governments powerful tools to combat industry claims that measures to control tobacco use have a negative economic impact. This report shows how lives can be saved and economies can prosper when governments implement cost-effective, proven measures like significantly increasing taxes and prices on tobacco products and banning tobacco marketing and smoking in public, Bettcher said.LERATO DIALEleratod@thenewage.co.za
