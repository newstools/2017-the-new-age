A week before the important ANC national policy conference the past weekend saw some of the most important provincial general councils (PGCs) being held.The provinces of KZN and Gauteng have been major players in the political chess game that has been unfolding for the past few years since the ANC s last national elective conference in 2012 in Mangaung.The popular shorthand narrative developed by many journalists is that KZN and Gauteng are on opposite sides of the political divide of the political tensions and disagreements associated with those who are pro- or anti- President Jacob Zuma.A cursory and shallow look at how the respective two PGCs were conducted, and the conference declarations and resolutions that were adopted at the end of the conferences, could easily boost this narrative.To write a tale of two opposing political provincial heavyweights locking horns in an ever deepening divisive fight is a glib journalistic trick which is easy to write and for readers to consume.It fits the already existing narrative about a divided ANC, and neither the writer or reader need to exert much effort to be guided to the conclusion that the ANC is heading for a bloody internecine war of which the policy conference will be the initial battlefield with the major bloodletting to be concluded at the national elective conference coming this December.Having attended the KwaZulu-Natal PGC, but also having followed the Gauteng PGC closely, I think we will do our readers a gross disservice if we simply present this same hackneyed narrative to them.Yes, it is true that the provincial leadership of the ANC in Gauteng have expressed criticism of President Zuma, and that some of them even called for the president to step down. The secretary-general of the ANC, Gwede Mantashe, acknowledged such when he delivered the keynote opening address at their PGC.However, Mantashe also repeated the view expressed by the national executive committee (NEC) of the ANC that attempts to remove Zuma ultimately rooted in attempts to remove the ANC itself as the ruling party in South Africa.It is also true that Zuma received a heroers welcome when he addressed the KZN PGC. However, the president delivered a speech that emphasised the huge responsibility that rests on the ANC as the vanguard of the national democratic revolution.His clarion call to the delegates was for them to live up to their responsibilities, to be wise in the decisions that they take and re-commit themselves to the unity of the ANC.Unity was the theme that was also picked up by Sihle Zikalala, the chairperson of the ANC in KZN, in his opening address and repeated again in his closing address.Referring to the contributions that the delegates at the conference made Sikalala emphasised: All of us made a profound statement that the unity of the ANC is sacrosanct. I know that all of us are committed to ensure that this undertaking does not become an empty statement. In his closing remarks Paul Mashatile, the chairperson of the ANC in Gauteng, also made the unity of the ANC the central theme of his address.Clearly unity has been identified as critical for the future of the ANC, but that in itself does not mean that it will be easy to achieve it.An overview of the divergent points of view contained in the resolutions of the two PGCs makes this evident. Gauteng as was made clear by its deputy chairperson, David Makura does not like to talk about white monopoly capital (WMC), in fact Makura thinks to attach white to monopoly capital is a distraction and prefers the more amorphous statement that they are against all monopoly capital.In their discussions about economic transformation Gauteng could not entirely avoid referring to radical socio-economic transformation, but it was evidently done without much enthusiasm with a preference to talk about inclusive growth .In the KZN resolutions about radical socio-economic transformation there is no such ambiguity a spade is called a spade &#8211; and white monopoly capital is identified as a scourge and called by its name. This was also evident in Sikalala s closing remarks when he referred to those in the democratic government who have been deliberately and purposely co-opted by WMC.With such divergent views to work for unity is clearly not going to be an easy task. The proverbial mountain will have to be climbed. However, that mountain will have to be climbed because the alternative is too ghastly to contemplate. The unity that the ANC now so urgently needs to pursue will only be achieved if the organisation returns to its roots which are deeply grounded in the masses of the people.Those roots of the ANC are its branches, and historically their ideals are expressed by the Freedom Charter that states unequivocally that the people shall govern and that the people shall share in the country s wealth. It is in returning to the guidance of its branches, most of them rooted and existing within the masses of poor South Africans that the ANC will rediscover the common ground that will be required to maintain unity within the organisation. Such unity will have to be principled about addressing poverty and inequality.As Zikalala said in his closing address, in searching for unity: The crippling danger of conformism need to be confronted. It cannot be that in the quest for unity the pursuit for economic justice through radical socio-economic transformation should be compromised.In the pursuit of unity Zikalala said the ANC in KNZ will engage with other provinces about the names to go forward for the top six and additional members of the NEC that is to be elected in December. He made a significant observation in that it would be wise to be inclusive and not to simply push for one slate at the exclusion of everyone else.The approach that is beginning to take shape is that political principles in the pursuit of achieving the second phase of the national democratic revolution will be paramount, while the names that have thus far been promoted by various groupings within the ANC can be subject to further discussion. This seems to be a politically mature approach that places policies first, rather than names.The minimum platform for such principled unity that is beginning to emerge is: The advancement of radical socio-economic transformation that must bring a fundamental realignment of the balance of forces in our economy in favour of the majority of South Africans (especially Africans); Land redistribution without compensation; Free and quality education up to the first degree; The strengthening of ANC headquarters with more full-time NEC members and an amendment of the ANC constitution to create two deputy secretary general positions. One responsible for monitoring, evaluation and research and the other for organisation building and campaignsAll of the above in the context of renewal of the national liberation movement with a commitment to rise above parochial provincial interests in the ultimate pursuit of unity, with the understanding that there will be no progress without a strong and united ANC.Carl Niehaus is a former member of the NEC of the ANC and an NEC member of the Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association.
