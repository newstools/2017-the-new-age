Colonialism in South Africa occurred not because there were interests in developing and improving the lives of the local, indigenous peoples rather it occurred in order to further the aims of the global, capitalist project.The Cape of Good Hope became strategic because already then the foundations of globalisation and a new global order were being formed.Later with the discovery of minerals on the Rand and various other places in southern Africa, the Cape of Good Hope and later ports such as Durban became strategic entry and exit points for the colonialists.Unlike the colonialism in Asia, colonialism in Africa was extractive and we continue to suffer to this day the fate of the extraction of the resources from our continent.Extraction of human resources occurred through the slave trade and even today through the brain drain from the continent.Three hundred and sixty-five years after the arrival of Van Riebeeck at the Cape, the Cape and South Africa remains a strategic entry and exit point into the continent south of the Sahara. As was the case yesteryear, global forces recognise the importance of the role South Africa plays in the continent.The recent World Economic Forum on Africa emphasised the continent s potential.Strategically placed in the direction that the continent will take in the next 50 years is the Africa 2063 road map spearheaded by the former AU commission chairperson, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma.Besides the demographic dividend which the continent seeks to reap over the next few decades, with over half of the more than billion population being young people, a number of high level projects are set in the plan.An integrated high speed train network and the Grand Inga Dam project are two infrastructure development projects envisaged.A continental free trade zone, African passport and the free movement of peoples as well as an e-university and pan e-network allows for much better networks among Africans.Therefore, despite the grim outlook for the global economy which has its effect on the local and continental market, it is important to note that Africa is the place where the rest of the world wants to be.It is for this reason, among others, that world leaders continue to engage African leaders at fora such as the US-Africa Summit, Focac, India-Africa Summit and the EU-Africa Summit.While all of this is taking place, the strategy and tactics document of the ANC, as it prepares for its 54th national conference, reads: The cause of social transformation in South Africa is taking place in a global environment characterised by contradictory tendencies in terms of human development and the crisis of neo-liberal capitalism (Strategy and Tactics document, para 5).In other words, what is happening on a global scale is directly impacting on the socio-political outlook on South Africa.The crisis within global capital, and thus having an impact on liberal democracies the world over, has given rise to tendencies towards the right in South Africa, especially those who were formerly left orientated.One hastens to add, though, that there exists a crisis in the left too, globally and not only in South Africa.As it tries to negotiate a hegemonic neo-liberal capitalist global order, the left, when in crisis, seems to do only one thing, go liberal themselves. There is nothing, for example, in our higher education landscape that even hints that the general-secretary of the SACP has been the minister of that portfolio, at least for the past eight years.Instead, students themselves have had to take up the call to fight for education, as a public good, instead of the minister, the leader of the SACP, leading this campaign.Education as a public good, socialism 101.It therefore comes as no surprise that Black First Land First had to school two traditional confessed communists, Joan Fubbs and Yunus Carriem, in the basics of Marxism.Our home-grown communists have come to acculturate completely with the capitalist state found in South Africa today and have scoffed off ideas such as radical economic transformation, when this in itself is more left leaning than any policy these two members of Parliament have pushed through in their last term of office.As a result of these crisis, both in the left but even more so in neo-liberal capitalism, the ANC continue in their strategy and tactics document: Accompanying these multiple crises is the declining legitimacy of the political and business elites. This is a consequence of their inability to address the fundamental questions of social inequality, declining social ethics and mismanagement of such global challenges as migration and terrorism. Narrow nationalism and chauvinism are on the ascendancy. Selfish geo-political pursuits and the rise of the security-industrial complex threaten to worsen global tensions and plunge the world into a devastating inferno. We may suggest that the recent election of France s Emmanual Marcon, of course, and the Austrian election fly in the face of this narrow-nationalist and chauvinistic trend.Yet it is easily identifiable in the election of Donald Trump, the referendum on Brexit, the deposing of Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff, the recent riots in Venezuela and the strengthening of leaders such as al-Sisi in Egypt, Netanyahu in Israel and Duerte in the Phillipines.All of these point to these selfish geopolitical pursuits and the rise of the security-industrial complex.The people witnessing these trends therefore lose faith in the political and business elites.Or is it because they have already lost faith that these are able to emerge?Was Donald Trump able to win because he is seen as a lessor of the establishment candidate than Hillary Clinton?A greater task though for ANC leaders, as they tread the journey towards electing leaders at their conference later in the year, is to ensure that the leaders whom they elect do not have the inability to address the fundamental questions of social inequality, declining social ethics and mismanagement of global (or local) challenges .The leaders chosen at the national conference must be able to articulate and provide leadership in order to get South Africa out of the quagmire that it finds itself in. A quagmire, not caused by President Jacob Zuma as some would want us to believe, but which is a result of the quagmire the continent and the world finds itself in.Do those running for the ANC presidency then have an appreciation of the global challenges and have they served at a global and continental level in order to grasp these challenges and to mitigate them?Are they offering South Africans the same which has been given to the country in the past 23 years thereby maintaining the status quo in the name of being anti-corruption ?It would seem that the radical economic transformation team is winning the battle of ideas as even the other side is now addressing issues of transforming the economy, addressing the question of land and ensuring a safety net for the poor.However, while the type of policies they propose is important, their skills and understanding of global and continental forces are also paramount.If they cannot understand and fight this, the legacy of colonialism will continue.Meokgo MatubaMeokgo Matuba is the secretary-general of the ANC Women s League
