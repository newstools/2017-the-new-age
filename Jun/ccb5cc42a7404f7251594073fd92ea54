Twenty-three others were taken to Nessie Knight Hospital, 10 of whom are being treated for smoke inhalation and 13 others are being treated for burnt wounds.They are so serious that they will be transferred to Nelson Mandela Academic hospital, where they will be treated for burns. The incident took place about 6am yesterday. Police were at the scene together with health officials and traditional leaders assessing the situation.But I must indicate that the initiation school was built of grass, Kupelo said. Kupelo said the latest deaths bring to four the number of youths killed since the start of the winter initiation season. He said previously two initiates died from medical conditions.Illegal initiation schools are responsible for a number of deaths each year with the Eastern Cape being the worst affected.DIKELEDI RAMABOPA
