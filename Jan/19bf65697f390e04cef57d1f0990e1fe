A Kenyan court on Thursday gave doctors and nurses five days to end a crippling nationwide strike, reneging on an earlier threat to jail union officials.The strike that began on December 5 has left public hospitals shut and patients unable to get basic medical care for more than seven weeks.Hellen Wasilwa, a judge at Kenya&#8217;s Employment and Labour Relations Court, on January 12 gave seven union officials one-month suspended sentences and ordered them to end the strike within two weeks.But as that ultimatum passed on Thursday she gave the officials another five-day reprieve.&#8220;I hereby suspend the sentence further for five days and this is not for negotiation but for calling off the strike,&#8221; she said.The officials are due back in court on January 31.Doctors have rejected a government offer of a 40 percent rise saying that it fell short of promises made in a 2013 agreement and failed to address other issues such as staff shortages and lack of equipment.Kenyan university lecturers also went on strike a week ago over pay.The widespread, disruptive industrial action comes months before an August general election.AFP
