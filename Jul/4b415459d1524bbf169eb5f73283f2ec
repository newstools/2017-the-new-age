It is well known that Absa Premiership offseason deals offer thrills and surprises for all 16 clubs as far as player and coaching recruitments are concerned.A few clubs have already taken bold steps in announcing the coaches who will be in charge of their clubs, with Maritzburg United and Cape Town City earning rave reviews for making Fadlu Davids permanent head coach at the Team of Choice, while the enthusiastic Benni McCarthy was roped in at the Cape club.One of the biggest requests from fans, analysts and former players has always been that fresh new ideas be brought into the league in terms of coaches, which is why Davids and McCarthy have been welcomed.This in contrast, put the spotlight on teams like Free State Stars, who continue recycling coaches with the introduction on Sammy Troughton as the man to take over from Serame Letsoaka.That has not been well received, but it was not so much to absorb as compared to Bloemfontein Celtic charting into the worlds of the unknown, bringing in relatively unknown Veselic Jelusic to take over at the club. Orlando Pirates did it too last year, bringing in Sweden s Kjell Jonevret, who to date is still trying to get the hang of local football.Jelusic, who is remembered for his failure with the Botswana national team, was sold by Celtic to the fans as a man with immense credentials boasting among others an Uefa A licence and a PhD in physical education from the University of Belgrade .Even Celtic CEO Kumbulani Konco was at pains trying to convince all with the surprise appointment.But how someone who has no knowledge of the club, the players and South African football in general will build a team that has lost its identity since Max Tshabalala bought it remains a mystery. We are honoured to have such an experienced coach in our midst.Looking at how we performed last season, we are now solely focused on rebuilding the team, Konco said. We are intending to give Veselin sufficient time to assess the squad and subsequently advise on where we need to beef it up during the preseason.As much as positive results are important, we won t be putting unnecessary pressure on our new man, Konco said.Pirates did it with Jonevret, asking for patience from their fans, this after sacking Roger de Sa and Eric Tinkler, two local coaches who understand the club and who took it to the CAF Champions League and CAF Confederation Cup finals.Kaizer Chiefs, Maritzburg and Celtic too were addicted to recycling, taking turns with Ernst Middendorp, who brought little to the table other than his ultra defensive football style.Rainer Zobel, Tom Sainfiet, Denis Lavagne and Mark Harisson also form part of the list of coaches who were trusted by PSL teams while bringing nothing in return, but departing with millions of wasted rands in extragent salaries.mmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
