The remote chance Kaizer Chiefs had of snatching the South African Premiership title all but disappeared in Soweto Saturday after conceding a stoppage-time goal in a 1-1 draw with Golden Arrows.Following the stalemate, leaders Wits need win only one of four remaining fixtures to ensure Chiefs do not add to their four league titles, the last of which came two seasons ago. The draw also means former South Africa captain and centre-back Steve Komphela is set to complete two campaigns in charge of the &#8220;Amakhosi&#8221; (Chiefs) without winning any of the eight league and cup titles on offer.He fared poorly in the 2016 CAF Champions League, too, with Chiefs making a round-of-32 exit to ASEC Mimosas of the Ivory Coast. The Soweto club did not qualify for Africa this season. &#8220;What more can I do?,&#8221; Komphela asked reporters after seeing his side robbed of victory once more by a last-gasp goal. &#8220;I just cannot believe it has happened again.&#8220;We keep on conceding late equalisers so it seems the team do not want to learn from their mistakes,&#8221; added the man whose future at Chiefs must be in doubt after two barren seasons.Arrows coach Clinton Larsen said: &#8220;Our work ethic was magnificent. I told my boys to never give up, keep getting in crosses, and our perseverance paid off.&#8221;Both goals at Soccer City stadium came from substitutes with Ryan Moon putting Chiefs ahead on 77 minutes and Zimbabwean Knox Mutizwa levelling off a 94th-minute glancing header.Wits have 54 points, Cape Town City 52 and title-holders Mamelodi Sundowns 51 with four fixtures to play while Chiefs have 47 and SuperSport United 45 having played one match more.Thuso Phala scored the winner as SuperSport triumphed 3-2 at Polokwane City while a recent resurgence by Ajax Cape Town continued with a 1-0 win away to relegation-threatened Chippa United.-AFP
