The alleged fraudster who scammed 259 people into paying for alleged training and enlistment with the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) bought three luxury cars in September, but could not explain where the money came from.It emerged in the Pretoria North Regional Court yesterday that Petrus Ndaba, 55, had bought a BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Lexus.The self-appointed chief of command of the Amabutho Royal Defence told the court that he earned R45000 a month from the organisation. He is facing charges of stealing R18100 as well as charges of kidnapping, assault and crimen injuria of the 259 people he had lured into an alleged job scam.He said that his was a non-profit organisation which obtained money from funders and the membership joining fee of R3000. Dressed in a blue suit and looking confident, Ndaba said that he would plead not guilty to the allegations of theft against him.His supporters could be heard whispering that Ndaba was not a criminal.He was previously charged with murder in 1995. He served six-and-a-half years and was later released on parole. The prosecutor argued that Ndaba should be denied bail as he could flee the country.The case was postponed to today after his lawyers told the magistrate that they needed more time to look at the documents submitted yesterday. It will be in the best interests that our client be released from prison. He said he has been there (jail) since June 27 and he is a sick man with diabetes, his legal representative said.The state argued that Ndaba had committed a serious crime by using a logo similar to that of the SANDF, which was slammed for misleading members of the public.Ndaba was arrested last Tuesday for allegedly scamming 259 people rescued from Karen Park, Tshwane.They had paid for uniforms, registration and food, which were all part of a promise for a job in the military. Most of his alleged victims were from KZN, Limpopo, Eastern Cape and Gauteng.-KUTULLO MADISHA
