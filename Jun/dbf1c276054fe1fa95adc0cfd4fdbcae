Update: The North Gauteng High court has granted opposition parties the DA and EFF&#8217;s application to intervene in former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe&#8217;s on-going Labour Court battle.Molefe is engaged in a labour court bid to get his job back, however the DA and EFF want his reappointment as CEO back in May declared irrational.The Labour Court is now set to hear Molefe&#8217;s matter on Thursday, 28 June 2017.Earlier:The DA has called former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe&#8217;s urgent approach of the labour court an act of desperation which it intends to fight against.The DA approached the Labour court to apply to intervene as an interested party in the on going case.Advocate Paul Kennedy makes submission on behalf of DA Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitob makes submission on behalf of EFF &#8220;Mr Molefe&#8217;s urgent approach to the labour court is an act of desperation, as he knows that he may have a better chance of arguing he was unfairly dismissed, rather than proving his reappointment was rational,&#8221; said the DA&#8217;s James Selfe.&#8220;Essentially, Molefe is &#8216;forum shopping&#8217; from court to court, in a bid to find the easiest track to get more money. A win in the labour court could mean a large financial settlement,&#8221; he said.Earlier in the month Molefe decided to take both Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown and the Eskom board to the Labour Court. Molefe has argued that his dismissal was politically motivated.This was after Brown had instructed the Eskom board to rescind its decision to reinstate Molefe as Eskom CEO, a post he had quit last November, insisting at the time that he was leaving in the public interest and that he wanted to clear his name.Eskom also announced it would give him a R30m pension payout, a decision Brown opposed.Last week the Eskom board appointed Johnny Dladla as the new acting Group Chief Executive.-TNA Reporter
