The ANC s leadership in the province has congratulated the matric class of 2016 for achieving a pass rate of 81.3% and appealed to the class of 2017 to improve on this achievement.The total number of candidates registered to sit for the 2016 examination consisted of 60764 full-time and 7038 part-time pupils.The percentage obtained by the matric class in 2015 was 78.6% and the province had set itself a target of increasing the pass rate by at least 10%.ANC provincial spokesperson Sasekani Manzini said the ruling party would strengthen its cooperation with the relevant authorities and throw its support behind education so the province could continue to achieve positive Grade 12 results.Manzini said the ANC expected a large number of pupils to not only pass but also obtain the admission requirement for a bachelors degree. The ANC reaffirms its commitment of working with its government and all relevant stakeholders to create a conducive environment for teaching and learning, Manzini said. We call on the class of 2017 to roll up their sleeves and improve our pass rate. Their results must reflect a significant increase in the number of pupils who pass with admission to a bachelor s degree. Manzini also called on the matrics who failed to try again in order to improve on their results. The ANC in Mpumalanga encourages all those who have not made it to not give up but to make use of all available avenues to further their studies. We call on parents, youth formations and other stakeholders to provide the necessary support to these pupils and give them the required information to assist them to rewrite Grade 12 exams or to further their education. Announcing the matric results last week, education MEC Reginah Mhaule said 12 420 candidates obtained a bachelors degree pass last year, compared to 13 497 in 2015.francen@thenewage.co.za
