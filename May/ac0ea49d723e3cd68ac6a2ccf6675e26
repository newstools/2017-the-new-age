They stopped the man and questioned him. On searching him, the officers found a sealed cereal box in his back pack however, suspicions arose after shaking the box, the weight did not appear to be correct. The box was opened and inside they found 12 headache powder boxes, each containing 38 sachets of cocaine. The K9 narcotics dog, Charlie, also reacted positively to the contents. The suspect was arrested for dealing in drugs, police said.
