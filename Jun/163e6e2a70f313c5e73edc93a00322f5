Spanish and European champions Real Madrid announced on Thursday that they will hold a presidential election over the close season, provided somebody comes forward to challenge the incumbent Florentino Perez.&#8220;The Electoral board&#8230;have agreed to an election for the club president and board of directors,&#8221; read a statement published on the English version of the club website.Candidates have until June 18 to come forward, with the statement adding: &#8220;In the case that more than one candidate is announced, the Electoral board will make public the date and place for voting.&#8221;Perez was president between 2000 and 2006 and returned for a second spell in 2009, succeeding Ramon Calderon. Elections were announced in 2013 but Perez was the only candidate.Madrid are fresh from winning a first Spanish title since 2012 to go with a third Champions League in four seasons.The 70-year-old Perez, a civil engineer and head of construction firm ACS, changed the club&#8217;s statutes in 2012 to make it harder to stand as a candidate.Potential challengers need to have been &#8216;socios&#8217;, or members, of the club for 20 years and must be able to give a personal financial guarantee of 15 percent of the club&#8217;s budget.The 2017 Deloitte Football Money League listed Madrid&#8217;s revenue in the 2015-16 season at 620.1 million euros ($696.8 million, 538.4 million), the third highest in the world.-AFP
