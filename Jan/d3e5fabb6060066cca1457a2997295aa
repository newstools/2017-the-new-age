Suspended ANC Western Cape chairperson Marius Fransman, has appealed his sentence and slammed the provincial executive committee (PEC) for attacking him.He slammed acting provincial ANC chairperson Khaya Magaxa and provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs for being caretaker comrades and accused the ANC in the province of being hell-bent on self-destruction.Last November, the ANC national disciplinary committee found Fransman guilty on two counts of misconduct which involved abusing his office for the purpose of obtaining sexual favours from Louisa Wynand . I am appealing my disciplinary finding. It is a well-known fact that cannot be made undone by factional objection for fear of the imminent and certain collapse of an orchestrated assault on my person and office and standing, Fransman said in a statement.Fransman also lamented with despair the demise of ANC in the Western Cape.He said: The first communiqu of 2017, on the watch of caretaker comrades Khaya Magaxa and Faiez Jacobs, rants about evasive unity in the face of continued self-styled factionalism shamefully hides behind the honour of leaders, now dishonoured by factionalism and ignores completely the pressing matters of my uninterrupted urging the continued betterment of my constituents, so blatantly dismissed by an ANC bent on self-destruction. For the Khoi, the San and all the people of the Western Cape and our land, he said, affordable housing and integrated human settlements must be fast-tracked.To ensure human dignity proper sanitation must also be provided in the townships, while child healthcare also has to be addressed, he said.The circumstances of the working classes of all backgrounds should also be advanced, while farmworkers should be given better opportunities and tenure security, Fransman added. Yet, the PEC continues to attack me for respecting the ANC structures to the fullest extent by relying on the 105-year-old inviolable principles of the ANC, and challenging the ANC when I see these principles disgraced, Fransman said.ANC Western Cape spokesperson Jabu Mafusi said: We should wait for the appeal process against Marius sentence to be completed.
