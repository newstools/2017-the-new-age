The North Gauteng Court has sentenced a man to 30 years in prison for the murder of his son and wife and injuring his daughter. Alfred Freddy Setlale entered into a plea bargain agreement where he had to plead guilty to all charges of murder and attempted murder in exchange for 30 years behind bars. Setlale apologised for fatally shooting his wife Delane and their six-year-old son Tshepo. He also admitted to firing a shot at his four-year-old son Tshegofatso. According to Setlaleâ€™s plea statement, he fired the shots in a fit of rage. The court was told that Setlale snapped during an argument with his wife, resulting in Setlale shooting her in front of two of his three children before shooting at them. He said that on the day of the crime, he left his children with a neighbour because his wife was not home. According to Setlale, his wife was angry with him for leaving the children with the neighbour. He said he wanted to commit suicide after killing his family but could not gather enough courage to do so. Setlale said that although he acted while enraged, he knew at the time that his conduct was wrong and punishable. -TNA Reporter
