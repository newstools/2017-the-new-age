Leader of the Democratic Alliance (DA) Mmusi Maimane on Thursday took to Twitter to condemn comments made by Western Cape Premier Hellen Zille in defence of colonialism. Maimane said that Colonialism, like Apartheid, was a system of oppression and it can never be justified. Let&#39;s make this clear: Colonialism, like Apartheid, was a system of oppression and subjugation. It can never be justified.&mdash; Mmusi Maimane (@MmusiMaimane) March 16, 2017Spokesperson for the DA, Phumzile Van Damme, echoed the sentiments expressed by Maimane.&#8220;Colonialism was a crime against humanity. There isn&#8217;t a single aspect of it that can be said to be positive or beneficial to Africans,&#8221; Van Damme tweeted.Colonialism was a crime against humanity. There isn&#39;t a single aspect of it that can be said to be positive or beneficial to Africans.&mdash; Phumzile Van Damme (@zilevandamme) March 16, 2017This follows a tweet sent by Zille on Thursday suggesting that colonial legacy has positive benefits. For those claiming legacy of colonialism was ONLY negative, think of our independent judiciary, transport infrastructure, piped water etc.&mdash; Helen Zille (@helenzille) March 16, 2017What started out as a simple complaint about service at OR Tambo, quickly escalated into a debate on colonialism and its legacy. Come on @Airports_ZA! Since 2016, tv screen in protocol &quot;bull room&quot; disabled + no remote! Just from @ChangiAirport.The difference is clear!&mdash; Helen Zille (@helenzille) March 16, 2017Zille went on to ask would we have had a transition into specialised health care and medication without colonial influence?Would we have had a transition into specialised health care and medication without colonial influence? Just be honest, please.&mdash; Helen Zille (@helenzille) March 16, 2017Social media users were quick to respond to Zille&#8217;s Tweet: Bless the people who are sending Zille reading material. As if she&#39;s just &quot;misinformed&quot; and needs people to educate her. Weeeeh. pic.twitter.com/kud7Y8qUsq&mdash; Gugulethu Mhlungu (@GugsM) March 16, 2017Helen Zille is a certified white supremacist. She&#39;s more dangerous than an outright racist because she pretends to be liberal. Disgusting.&mdash; Mfondiny (@Mfondiny) March 16, 2017Zille is sober. Those are her sober thoughts she has been bottling in for decades.&mdash; sicelo (@sicelosr) March 16, 2017Helen Zille in the street&#13;Helen Zille in the sheets pic.twitter.com/DSChR0suHg&mdash; Ryan Cummings (@Pol_Sec_Analyst) March 16, 2017@ ImTawanda I really hate this narrative. There are numerous countries that have &#8220;piped water&#8221; without having been colonised or enslaved. @ Qingqile_Wing : Applying the same logic, murder is good, it results in less people on earth, climate change is great it, gives us warmer winters @ stavo231 : Even rape can produce a beautiful baby, what is your point exactly madam Premier! @ SiphoMosotho We must be grateful 4 brutality,theft and Thuggery. By the way the judiciary only became independent after 94 respect us wena @ andiemanz : i I love how you are always true to yourself. You never pretend to be something you&#8217;re not. You&#8217;re racist and proud! @ ShuaibManjra none of these were colonial &#8216;inventions&#8217;. Your reading of history seems limited to colonial history. @ Thabiso_Dlamini infrastructure built buy exploited black workers? Muruti Mmusi: Come walk with me&#8230;Helen: I&#8217;m not talking to you, you forced me to apologize. But tell me who is this so close behind me ? pic.twitter.com/ieqZUkDT35 RSA Min of Sport (@MbalulaFikile) March 16, 2017&nbsp;
