While Lichtenburg was established during the time of the diamond rush more than a century ago, it has since become a predominantly farming town.The little town lies between the North West provincial capital, Mahikeng and a small town, Coligny, along the R503.Lichtenburg is situated about 230km west of South Africa s metropolis and commercial hub of Johannesburg and lies 1459m above sea level.It is where the Ditsobotla local municipality offices are located and despite challenges in the local government sphere, the pretty little town s streets are lined with willow trees and tidy, at least in the central business district.Lichtenburg emerged as early as 1873 but it was the diamond rush that placed the town on the map, bringing thousands of prospectors to this part of the world in the late 1920s.Hennie Potgieter s massive equestrian statue of the great Boer general Koos de la Rey, who farmed near Lichtenburg, was unveiled in the town in 1965. General De La Rey was the town s representative in the House of Assembly and assistant commandant-general of the Boer forces. He died after a shooting incident at Langlaagte and was buried in Lichtenburg.Lichtenburg is sometimes called Wilgedorp because of the willow trees along the furrows lining the streets. The town was established on the farms Middelbosch and Doornfontein which were presented for this purpose to the Transvaal Republic by commandant Hendrik Greeff in 1866. The town was the focus of diamond fever from 1925 to 1930. As fate would have it, the discovery of the world s largest red diamond in 1927, known as a pigeon blood red, added to the influx of diamond diggers to Lichtenburg.This is an incredibly rare stone and the claim is that fewer than 20 naturally occurring red diamonds exist today one can only imagine the price tag attached to each of these.While diamond mining lasted, there were some 50000 diggers and 100000 labourers active in the district. After an estimated 15m (R255m) worth of diamonds had been found, the source waned and only a few diggers remained to pursue their dreams of fortune.Those who want to learn more can visit the Lichtenburg Diggings Museum, which covers the alluvial diamond diggings in and around the town from 1925 to 1935. One other sure area to visit is the Willem Annandale art gallery that exhibits more than 300 priceless and incredibly beautiful paintings, sculptures, graphics and ceramics of South African and North West artists.With the passage of time, Lichtenburg has remained today predominantly because of the surrounding maize, groundnut and sunflower seed farms that owe their existence to the presence of natural water resources in the area hence the willows.The backbone of Lichtenburg s economy is now agricultural and the maize produced in the district is handled by one of the biggest cooperative companies in the country. Other grains are also produced and cattle ranching is another major agricultural occupation.The climate of Lichtenburg is healthy and moderate. Frost occurs in winter but the days are pleasantly sunny. As a result of natural water resources and wide-open spaces it has a natural charm and is an oasis in a slightly arid region.Lichtenburg is worth a stop over for the quaint tranquillity, sense of history and calm that the little town offers visitors. It s also a convenient stop over en route to the Mmabatho casino.The town offers wonderful overnight leisure in its serene environment and there are many other places offering good value for money.There is the Lichtenburg Game Breeding Centre, whose main aim is to augment the Pretoria National Zoo s breeding programmes of endangered species and to supplement the animal populations at the zoo.A good network of roads facilitates the viewing of animals. The hide at the Vulture Restaurant allows one to see these magnificent birds at close quarters as food is put out regularly.Stay overnight by booking into a self-catering guest house.This consists of three bedrooms with en suite bathrooms, a kitchen and sitting room. An additional two self-contained units which can accommodate three people each are also available.Those who want to explore more of this little but lively agricultural town can book in time for a historical tour under the guidance of an experienced guide.TNA REPORTERprovinces@thenewage.co.za
