Mazda introduced its Mazda MX-5 RF (retractable fastback) through a digital retail launch last week.The Mazda MX-5 RF is based on the fourth-generation MX-5 roadster coupe, which has won more than 280 car awards around the world and became the first model to win both World Car of the Year and World Car Design of the Year in 2016.It is dedicated to the past, present and future of the world s all-time best selling roadster.Mazda has added an innovativedesign and a retractable hardtop that can be opened and closed with ease.The new top closes and opens in 13 seconds in a beautifully choreographed sequence at the flip of a switch, even when the car is moving at up to 10km/h.Like its predecessor, the MX-5 RF features one of the fastest retractable tops available, combining the practicality and convenience of a power roof with distinctive new lines that perfectly suit the Kodo-inspired body shared with the new-generation soft-top MX-5.Featuring steering and suspension tweaked in the name of refinement, the MX-5 RF handles every bit as well as its perfectly balanced sibling while offering a far quieter cabin with the roof closed.The Roadster RF features fastback styling with a smooth roof line that curves down to the rear end, and itsunique rear roof and retractable back window offer a new open-air feeling.Stowing the roof in the limited space enables the Roadster RF to offer the same trunk space as the soft-top model.It is available in a 2.0-litre Skyactiv petrol engine with 6-speed automatic transmission.Model additions include the adaptive front-lighting system, lane departure warning and blind spot monitoring safety features, a navigation system and automatic shift switch.It comes with a three-year unlimited kilometre factory warranty, a three-year service plan with three-year roadside assistance and a five-year corrosion warranty. Pricing begins at R532 800 for the 2.0L RF Roadster Coupe automatic.
