While Black First Land First (BLF) remained unrepentant, the South African National Editors Forum (Sanef), is set to proceed with legal action against movement for threatening some journalists.Sanef said it would apply for an urgent interdict against the BLF to stop it from gathering outside of the homes of targeted journalists and refrain from harassing and intimidating them, among other things. Journalists should be free to practice their craft without fear or intimidation and this comes with a degree of responsibility in their reporting which includes the values and ethos enshrined under the Bill of Rights, Communications Minister Ayanda Dlodlo said.On Friday the movement released a statement titled BLF Warns White Journalists in which it said it would not tolerate racism, fake news and the covering up of white corruption under the guise of journalism .The statement included a list of names of targeted journalists. Among them are Business Day editor-at-large Peter Bruce, News24 editor Adriaan Basson, EWN s Stephen Grootes and Barry Bateman.Sanef chairperson Mahlatse Gallens said he was disappointed at BLF s actions saying they undermined media freedom. We condemn the action in the strongest terms. We are very perturbed that the BLF has taken to threaten journalists to try and silence them, Gallens said.BLF said it would update its list of targeted journalists. We shall deal with each of them as rogue racists who deserve to be treated in the same manner which Bruce was treated. They are racists, not journalists, and they will be treated as such, the BLF said.On Thursday, about 20 BLF members protested outside Bruce s house in Parkview, Johannesburg.The group vandalised Bruce s house, writing land or death on the garage roller door.Sanef sent a letter to BLF, through its law firm Webber Wentzel, asking the movement to commit to not attacking journalists or face legal action.However, BLF released another statement saying to Webber Wentzel we say, watch out, we may just pay you a visit too! Sanef is a useless distraction. We won t even picket it. LILLIAN SELAPISAlillians@thenewage.co.za
