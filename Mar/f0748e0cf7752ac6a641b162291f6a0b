Everton have been dealt another injury blow ahead of Saturday&#8217;s Premier League derby against Liverpool after defender Ramiro Funes Mori was injured while playing for Argentina.Funes Mori left the field on a stretcher clutching his left knee after 36 minutes as Argentina lost 2-0 to Bolivia in a World Cup qualifier in La Paz on Tuesday.He has made 26 appearances for Everton this season and would have been in Everton manager Ronald Koeman&#8217;s plans for the lunchtime kickoff at Anfield.The international break has not been kind to Everton&#8217;s defence with Seamus Coleman breaking his leg while playing for Ireland against Wales last Friday.Everton have not commented on the severity of Funes Mori&#8217;s injury but it seems unlikely he will be fit.-Reuters
