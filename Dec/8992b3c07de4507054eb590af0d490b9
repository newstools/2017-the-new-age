Outgoing ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe says branch structures nullified by High Court judgments will not be allowed to vote in the party’s national conference. Mantashe said the National Executive Committee (NEC) members took a decision not to taint the conference by allowing affected delegates to vote. ”All delegates nullified by yesterday’s (Friday) judgment will not vote. We will not take a risk. They will not be participating in this conference,” the outgoing Secretary General said. The NEC met earlier on Saturday morning to discuss the court’s judgment handed down in three different provinces. The three provinces that are affected by the judgment are KZN, Free State and North West. He said they will, however, be allowed to attend the conference as they have a right to be attending. “They will not be voting on any matter,” he said.   -TNA Reporter
