Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane has urged mining companies to reinforce their health and safety procedures following seismic activity which claimed the lives of three miners at Harmony Gold s Kusasalethu Mine near Carletonville.&#8220;We are concerned about the accidents we are seeing in the industry. As we head towards the last quarter of the year, we are asking that employers and the workforce remain alert and continue to prioritise safety, and as the Regulator, we will be increasing inspections,&#8221; said Zwane.This morning, mine officials confirmed that the body of a third miner had been brought to the surface.Five miners were left trapped at 3.1m on Friday morning following a seismic event at the mine.Corporate relations officer for Harmony Gold Marian van der Walt confirmed that mine management had yesterday met with the bereaved families. They were all transported to the shaft in the morning and we are offering counseling and support to them. This is an overwhelming and difficult time for them and us and we would like to offer our deepest condolences to the families.&#8220;The company would cover all costs including the funerals and will take responsibility to fund the education of the children of those who lost their lives in the event,&#8221; she said. Also, when a member loses their life at our mine they can be replaced by a family member. So all of that will be taken care of.&#8221;The mine has since suspended operations.The mining sector continues to suffer fatalities with four miners perishing earlier this year at the Tau-Lekoa gold mine in Orkney in the North West.Earlier in the year, Zwane announced that Occupational safety in South African mining had improved with an overall 5% reduction in the number of fatalities in the sector when he released the health and safety performance statistics of the industry for the 2016 calendar year which reported 73 fatalities.The 2015 stats saw 77 fatalities recorded in the mining sector which was at the time the lowest number of fatalities in the mining sector since the start of mining in South Africa.-TNA Reporter
