The new-look state airliner, South African Airways (SAA), has appointed highly qualified Phumeza Nhantsi as the new chief financial officer (CFO), effective from May 1. Some commentators welcomed the announcement as good for transformation at a time when both private and public sector companies are seen to be not promoting black talent. “Appointing Nhantsi at the young age of 39 is a major step forward, especially considering the lack of black women in top senior management,” one commentator said. Nhantsi was appointed as SAA’s interim CFO in November 2015 after the position was left vacant following the departure of Wolf Meyer. The appointment followed a rigorous recruitment and selection process before a recommendation was made to the shareholders for concurrence. “Since the appointment of the full-strength board in September 2016, the focus has been on stabilising the business and one of the priorities was to ensure that key management vacancies were filled. “This is one such key appointment for the airline to ensure that SAA’s strategic objective of transforming the business into a financially sustainable aviation group is achieved,” Musa Zwane, SAA acting CEO, said. Prior to joining SAA, Nhantsi was a director at the largest blackowned accounting firm, SizweNtsalubaGobodo, the fifth-largest accounting firm in southern Africa. Nhantsi, who is a CA, has extensive experience in financial services and aviation. The appointment of Nhantsi came two days after the Department of Labour’s Commission of Employment Equity released yet another damning report on corporate disregard for transformation. -TNA REPORTER|business@thenewage.co.za
