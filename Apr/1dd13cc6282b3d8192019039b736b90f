Henri s sister Marli sustained a serious head injury, but survived.Looking subdued but unemotional, Van Breda stood close to his legal team as the large entourage gathered outside his home where he claims to have watched an intruder set upon his loved ones, laughing as he cut them down.-TNA Reporter
