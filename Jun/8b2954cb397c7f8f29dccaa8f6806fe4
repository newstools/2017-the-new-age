Cities are the main engines and centres for economic growth and should do more to ensure this objective was achieved, Finance minister Malusi Gigaba said today.Gigaba was addressing the two-day Ekurhuleni Investment Conference in Kempton Park.In his address, he told the delegates that South Africa&#8217;s cities were currently growing faster than the national economy, with metro economies growing by 11.1% between 2011 and 2016 while all other areas of the country combined only grew by 4.6%. In the last two years, between the first quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2017, 448 000 jobs were created in the metros, but all other areas of South Africa combined generated only 305 000 jobs, Gigaba said.But Gigaba cautioned that the current growth rates in the metros were not good enough to sustain the ever increasing populations.He blamed the sluggish growth of city economies on the dispersed and inside-out spatial form inherited from apartheid.&#8221;&#8220;In the past, poor working class black people were placed in the townships that were far from economic and social opportunities, with poor quality services, little access to acceptable housing coupled with poor transport services,&#8221; he said.He said to be more productive cities needed to become more compact , and that the infrastructure and services should be provided in a manner that encouraged connectedness .The minister was all praise for the growth realised in Ekhurhuleni, but warned that economic growth would always be hamstrung by a growing population requiring faster economic development. Inclusive economic growth requires that Ekurhuleni grows faster and generates jobs more quickly and on a sustainable basis,&#8221; he said.Ekhurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina echoed the sentiments expressed by Gigaba, adding that inclusive growth was required to address the metros challenges.&#8220;We have a mammoth task of providing answers and I hope this conference will not become just another talk shop. We need to deliver now,&#8221; Masina said.-TNA Reporter
