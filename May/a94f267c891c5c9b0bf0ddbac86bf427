Sunderland midfielder Steven Pienaar has been left to weigh his options after English Premiership side Sunderland were relegated at the weekend.Pienaar suffered the ignominy of relegation for the first time in his professional career, now spanning 18 years, as Sunderland s 10-year stay in the Premiership ended with four matches to play following their 1-0 loss to Bournemouth at the weekend. The former Bafana Bafana skipper came off shortly after the interval as Sunderland suffered their 23rd loss of the season.Pienaar has been on a season-long contract, having been recruited by former Everton coach David Moyes before the start of the season when it looked as though the Ajax Cape Town youth product would return to the PSL. He has battled with injuries which mainly accounted for his limited 15 appearances for the Black Cats, having started only 10 matches. At 35, Pienaar is no spring chicken and it remains to be seen whether he will continue his career in the PSL or go down to the English Championship.Elsewhere, Keagan Dolly did not have enough time to influence play after being introduced in the last five minutes as Montpellier went down 3-0 to Lille in the French Ligue 1. Montpellier remain 13th in the French Ligue 1, six points above the relegation zone. In the French Ligue 2, Kermit Erasmus came on in the 45th minute as Lens went down 1-0 to AC Le Harve while Lebogang Mothiba s Valenciennes lost 1-0 to Ajaccio.There was more reason to celebrate for Dino Ndlovu, who scored his 15th goal of the season as Qarabag wrapped up their season with a 1-0 victory over Neftci in the Azerbaijan Premier League at the weekend. Ndlovu is already a league champion with Qarabag and will soon be back in the country for the off-season break. It s been a similarly great spell for Bongani Zungu, whose Portuguese side Vitoria Guimaraes won 2-0 win against Vitoria Setubal on Friday.In the lower Portuguese league, Luther Singh was on the losing side as Sporting Braga B lost to Vitoria Guimaraes B. Meanwhile, Andile Jali made a rare appearance for Oostende as they won 1-0 against Charleroi in their Jupiter Pro League play-offs match. Although Jali only played for a minute, it was a welcome return for the Bafana midfielder, who has only played nine matches this season.Tokelo Rantie came off at the interval as Turkish side Genclerbirligi played out a 1-1 draw against Trabzonspor while May Mahlangu was in the match-day squad for Dinamo Bucaresti against FCSB.-KGOMOTSO SETHUSHA|kgomotsos@thenewage.co.za
