JSE-LISTED Hulisani, a black-managed investment company, has snapped up a stake in GRI Wind Steel SA, a producer of wind towers to the global market. Hulisani is focused on energy projects, including renewable energy and coal and gas. The investment is via an indirect acquisition of an effective 12.5% in GRI SA and the provision of preference share funding to Pele SPV 198, a wholly owned subsidiary of Pele Green
Energy, which enables PGE to indirectly acquire 12.5% in GRI SA. The deal is valued at R82.5m. Marubini Raphulu, Hulisani’s CEO, said the transaction, its third, was in line with the  company’s strategy to invest in a diverse basket of energy producing assets with potential for growth. This latest transaction came in the wake of the acquisition of Kouga wind farm and Rustomo1, a solar PV farm. “This deal marks a move down the renewable energy value chain for Hulisani. GRI SA is a producer of elements used in the creation of renewable energy. The supply of wind towers
continues to outstrip demand and we are excited about the prospect of exporting wind towers while creating jobs in SA,” Raphulu said. “The preference share funding is significant as it enables further black participation in the
manufacturing value chain,” he said. GRI SA opened its first wind tower manufacturing plant in Atlantis, Cape Town, 2014 and has the capacity to provide the global market with over 150 towers a year, creating at least 300 local jobs in the process. business@thenewage.co.za
