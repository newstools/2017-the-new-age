Four Chelsea football fans, including an ex-policeman, battled charges of racist violence in a Paris court on Tuesday for which they could face prison terms.In the Paris metro, the four were among Chelsea fans who chanted &#8220;we are racist, we are racist and that&#8217;s the way we like it&#8221; as they pushed back a black man trying to board the train.In court, the fans denied their acts were racist in nature.Joshua Parsons, 22, a former pupil of the elite Millfield school in England, now working in the building trade, and James Fairbairn, 25, a civil engineer, were the only two among the four to appear in court.Both wore grey suits for the hearing where a video of the incident was shown.Richard Barklie, a 52-year-old former policeman, and William Simpson, 27, were tried in absentia.The incident in February 2015 before a Champions League match between Paris Saint Germain and Chelsea was filmed by a Briton, Paul Nolan, and published by the Guardian newspaper.The video showed commuter Souleymane Sylla repeatedly being violently thwarted in his attempts to get on a train at the Richelieu Drouot station. Station CCTV footage also recorded the scene.Parsons, Fairbairn and Barklie have already been banned from football stadiums in Britain.In France, they face a jail term of up to seven years and a 100,000-euro fine.-AFP
