The local unit continues to hold its ground against the US dollar and other major currencies, trading solidly below the R14 level and on its way to finishing the week on a high note. The local unit has been resilient in the last two weeks trading between R13.28/$ and R13.38/$.If the currency continues on this path, there is little doubt it will bring back the 52c/l petrol increase at the beginning of this month to consumers pockets. The oil price is also constant at between $50 (R666.8) and $55 per barrel, lifting some hopes of a petrol decline price next month. The unit opened trading strong at R13.25/$, and has since played between R13.27/$ and R13.38/$ range the whole of this week.Economists said the smooth run of the rand against major currencies despite run away inflation brings some relief to hard-pressed consumers. In 2016, the rand strengthened by 13.2% against the US dollar. This makes it the third-best performing emerging market currency in 2016 after the Brazilian real (+21.7%), and the Russian rouble (+19.7%), Kevin Lings, chief economist at Stanlib, said. The performance of the rand presently and in 2016 is in sharp contrast to 2015, when the rand depreciated by 25.4% against the dollar, making it the third-worst performing emerging market currency in 2015. Lings said a range of factors contributed to the recent strength of the rand, and that, importantly, despite South Africa s ongoing political uncertainty, and anaemic economic growth, there was a noticeable improvement in SA s trade balance as well as the deficit on the current account. In fact, South Africa moved from a monthly average trade deficit of R4.4bn in 2015 to an average monthly deficit of only R630m in 2016, recording more regular trade surpluses in the second half of 2016. It is also important to recognise that the rand was considered to be significantly undervalued at the end of 2015, having been over-sold in the three years from 2013 to 2015 (-45% cumulative), he said.John Cairns, RMB currency specialist, said the support lines on USD/ZAR and EUR/ZAR are both strong and are not going to give way easily. The local unit was seen still holding its ground and trading at around R13.27/$ by 2pm, with industrials and financial JSE indices the only sectors making money on the day.The All Share index also was better on the day at 53 396, 0.27% stronger. Towards the close of the bell the rand was trading at R13.33.-Bernard Sathekge|bernards@thenewage.co.za
