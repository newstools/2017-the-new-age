Thousands of ANC members and supporters are expected to flock to the party s 105 anniversary celebrations in Soweto this weekend.The ruling party s head of mobilisation, Fikile Mbalula, said about 800 buses have been scheduled to transport members across Gauteng and the neighbouring provinces such as Limpopo, North West and Free Sate.The ANC s fraternal friends which are former liberation movements in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region and representatives from Brics countries are also set to grace the event with their presence.Mbalula, yesterday, highlighted the importance of the January 8 statement that will be delivered by president Jacob Zuma.He said that the statement was a political statement from the NEC and not a statement by Zuma as the head of government. It is a statement that calls on all of us to focus on the tasks that are urgent and at the same time spells out what is expected from us as supporters, what we need to do to renew our vows to our people and to the communities, he said.Mbalula clarified the celebrations were not only about regaining lost ground but also about recommitting to deliver for people. It is crucial in Gauteng after the local election results last year, where the ANC party suffered a loss. All NEC members have been deployed throughout Gauteng. Leaders have been doing door to door campaigns in all five regions of Gauteng. The ANC NEC will sit tomorrow to finalise the January 8 statement to be delivered by president Jacob Zuma, he said.The top brass of the ANC have been on a campaign ahead of the Sunday celebration.Tomorrow there is to be an event at Vilakazi Street in Soweto, followed by a gala dinner on Saturday night at the Sandton Convention Centre which will be addressed by Zuma.He is also set to deliver the main message on Sunday at the rally at Orlando Stadium, with Mbalula saying the message would speak about introspection, reflection and charting the way forward for the movement.KUTULLO MADISHAkutullom@thenewage.co.za
