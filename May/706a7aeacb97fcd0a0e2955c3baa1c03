South African life insurance customers are the most satisfied with Metropolitan s offerings with a score of 82.6 points against the industry average of 79 points, reports the latest Customer Satisfaction Index (SAcsi) for life insurance.The company has consistently improved its score over the past three years, having climbed from 81.4 in 2015 and 74 in 2014. Old Mutual scored 80.3 (up 2.3 points), while Liberty scored 78.1 (up 4 points), Sanlam and Momentum were on par with the industry at 77.5 points each, up 2.6 and down 1.8 respectively.Discovery was the only company to score below the industry average, with a score of 74 points, down 1 point since 2015 and still below its 2014 score of 74.8. Now in its fifth year, the SAcsi Benchmark for Life Insurance offers impartial insights into the SA s life insurance industry by blending a customer expectations index, perceived quality index and a perceived value index to achieve an overall result out of 100.South Africa s top six insurers are included in the industry index: Metropolitan, Discovery, Old Mutual, Liberty, Momentum and Sanlam. The sample included 2 460 customers who were randomly selected for inclusion in the 2016 survey. In this category, there isn t a wide gap between the leaders and the laggards, compared to other industry benchmarks in the SAcsi, says Consulta CE Prof Adr Schreuder. In other sectors, such as short-term insurance, medical insurance and retail banking, the difference in satisfaction is much more varied as customers deal with the services more frequently and would be more cognisant of poor customer service. -SELLO RABOTHATA|sellor@thenewage.co.za
