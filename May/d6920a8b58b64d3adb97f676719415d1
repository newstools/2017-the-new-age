Former champion Maria Sharapova&#8217;s hopes of playing at this year&#8217;s Wimbledon championships could hinge on a June 20 meeting of tournament organisers unless the Russian hits form in forthcoming events in Rome and Madrid.Sharapova, who returned to action last week after a 15-month ban for an anti-doping violation, could still climb high enough in the WTA rankings to take her place in the Wimbledon qualifying tournament at Roehampton.Failing that the 2004 champion would need a wildcard, either into the main draw or the qualifying event the week before.&#8220;We have a long-standing tried and tested process (for awarding wildcards) in the week before qualifying and this year is no different,&#8221; All England Club chairman Philip Brook said at a news conference on Wednesday.&#8220;First we will see if Maria applies for a wildcard and if so we will consider her case alongside everyone else&#8217;s.&#8220;It will be a decision for the group on the day.&#8221;After reaching the semi-finals in Stuttgart last week, Sharapova&#8217;s first tournament since her ban for taking the prohibited substance Meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open, her world ranking rose to 262 in the world rankings.The cut-off date to enter Wimbledon&#8217;s main draw is May 22, the day after the conclusion of the Rome tournament in which Sharapova has been handed a wildcard.Even the Rome title would not put her high enough in the rankings to make the Wimbledon main draw, although a string of wins there and in Madrid the following week, where she also has a wildcard, could squeeze her into qualifying and potentially spare the All England Club a tough decision.Entry to the qualifying tournament closes on June 5.Several players, including former world number one Caroline Wozniacki and former Wimbledon runner-up Eugenie Bouchard, have been highly critical of tournament organisers handing five-times grand slam champion Sharapova wildcards.Brook said many factors would be considered before a decision was made.&#8220;We look at who has done well in the lead up tournaments. We will also consider what might add interest to the tournament,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If someone has a strong record at Wimbledon that would be taken into consideration.&#8221;Sharapova will learn on May 16 whether or not she will be awarded a wildcard for the French Open where she has twice been crowned champion.-Reuters
