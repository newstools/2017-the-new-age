Matthers come to a head today in the squabble between the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) and road construction company Tasima over the management of the eNaTIS system that administers most of the country s traffic and road management systems.eNaTIS a nationwide system of enormous complexity. Embedded in the national economy, it administers R14bn in revenue, processes more than 500 million transactions a year (2 million transactions every business day), has more than 2 400 sites nationwide and has up to 2 700 live users logging transactions at any one time.With more than 27 million entity records, it manages in excess of 11.3 million vehicles and 9 million drivers. The Pretoria High Court will today be asked to get Tasima to abide by a November 9, 2016, Constitutional Court order that it hand over the running of the eNaTIS system back to the Department of Transport whose RTMC will be responsible for.This follows a months-long battle during which the Department of Transport (DoT) had to take action to compel Tasima to comply with the Constitutional Court decision. The court found that the extension to the contract to Tasima contravened the Constitution, the Public Finance Management Act, and Treasury regulations.The DoT earlier said the court granted RTMC leave to terminate the illegal and irregular extension of the contract and Tasima was ordered to handover the running of eNaTIS and associated services to the RTMC within 30 days of the court decision in other words by early December. On Friday last week Telkom threatened to withdraw its services from Tasima over an unpaid R8m bill. Tasima stepped in and paid the bill on Monday, although it said it was not its responsibility.Tasima claims a different version of events. Its communications officer, Trevor James, says that on November 9, after lengthy litigation, the Constitutional Court: confirmed that the DoT, RTMC and their officers were in contempt of various orders of court; found that the 2010 extension of the turnkey agreement for the development and operation of the eNaTIS system was unlawful, as the DoT had not followed lawful processes; and limited the relief flowing from this to be forward looking, ordering, as of November 9, 2016, a transfer to RTMC. The Constitutional Court found no wrongdoing at all by Tasima and did not even award costs against Tasima. The court rejected the state s efforts to introduce new evidence to support any case of wrongdoing by Tasima. James said that unless an alternative transfer management plan was agreed to within 10 days of the order, the handover was to be conducted in terms of a migration plan that had already been set out in the turnkey agreement.He said the court recognised that a detailed plan would be required because of the complexity of the system which would continue to operate uninterrupted. Since the court order was handed down, Tasima has proactively been engaging in extensive negotiations with the RTMC in an effort to reach agreement on the key terms of handover in accordance with the order, James said.-Sello Rabothata|sellor@thenewage.co.za
