The exit of General Motors SA at the end of the year could be a major blow for the Treasury as it will further reduce the revenue base.GM said last week it was quitting SA and India as it realigns its struggling business and from next year, Isuzu dealers will provide after sales and service support to Chevrolet and Opel customers. GMSA is one of seven major vehicle manufacturers in SA, alongside Toyota, Volkswagen, Ford, Nissan, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Chinese manufacturer BAIC announced an R11bn investment plan last year at the Coega in Port Elizabeth. The South African vehicle manufacturing industry would increase its contribution to the GDP to 8.5% if it produces 900000 units by 2020 but this is seen as unlikely.Numsa general secretary Irvin Jim hit out at GMSA, citing a selfish decision to serve shareholders at the expense of workers and vowed to leave no stone unturned to protect jobs In 2015, the industry s total local production was about 600 000, with vehicle and component manufacturing constituting about 30% of SA s overall manufacturing output. Econometrix research shows the automotive industry contributed 7.2% (or R256.7bn) to GDP in 2015 while manufacturing contributed 4.4% of that and the rest from the retail industry.Analysts said despite the takeover by Isuzu, jobs were likely to be lost. The industry provides a total of 544 453 direct jobs. Motor manufacturers association Naamsa said the automotive industry in SA remained vibrant and strategically important. The industry is working closely with government and other stakeholders to formulate the post 2020 automotive development programme specifically to provide the industry and vehicle manufacturers with certainty and stability to enable automotive companies to invest and operate in South Africa with confidence, Naamsa said.It said the industry s medium to long term prospects would depend on the performance of the South African economy and the global economy which, at this stage, continued to look reasonably positive.-BERNARD SATHEKGE|bernards@thenewage.co.za
