FARMERS in the North West are set to kick-start an exchange programme with their counterparts in the Mansa, an area in Zambia s Luapula province.This comes as the North West provincial government has stepped up efforts to open up economic and friendly opportunities in the Southern Africa Development Community.A delegation comprising three MECs went out to Zambia recently and their key target was to promote agriculture, culture and tourism.This is one of the five key pillars put forward to anchor the provincial economy going forward.The delegation was led by rural, environment and agricultural development MEC Manketsi Tlhape. She was with Ontlametse Mochware of culture, arts and traditional affairs, as well as and Wendy Nelson of finance, enterprise and economic development.The delegation went to Luapula province and they had the chance to pave opportunities for exchange programmes for farmers.Tlhape said that the delegation spent five days in Zambia and they managed to attend the expo investment show in Mansa and visited a number of projects.This follows a conscious decision by the provincial government led by Premier Supra Mahumapelo to embark on an intense programme of engaging the South African Developing Countries to explore investment opportunities, business and social exchange programmes in agriculture, culture and tourism, she said. Tlhape said that the highlight of the visit was when the delegation, which included senior managers, managed to secure an opportunity for the South African farmers to initiate a 10000 to 20000ha crop production programme with the Zambian Luapula province and farmers. In order to further empower farmers for both countries, an agreement has been reached for cross exchange programme of farmers from Luapula and the North West province, she said.Modalities and how the programmes will be implemented are some of the issues that need to be ironed out but it is expected the development will bring a number of economic spin-offs to both provinces.There is also a strong possibility of a leading Zambian seed company opening up shop in the North West and help bring upcoming farmers up to speed with how they can bring up and preserve their seed varieties. A discussion for business partnership with the Zambian Seed Co to lead to the company establishing a base in the North West was initiated, Tlhape said.Municipalities in the two provinces are also set to explore opening up twinning agreements with Mansa municipality in Luapula.Tourism and cultural sectors are also in line for interesting times as more players from the SADC region are likely to be part of the province s thrust as it seeks partnerships.The Zambian visit has already paved way for possible areas of cooperation in that front and activities are likely to start rolling later this year. With the efforts to place tourism as part of key sectors of the provincial economy, the engagement of the Zambian traditional organisations, provincial administration, wildlife organisations has given the team the hope that there will be increased flow of Zambian tourists to South Africa with the upcoming Bokone Bophirima Agricultural Growth and Investment show in November this year as well as participation of the Zambian delegates, Tlhape said.She further pointed out that the delegation had the opportunity to meet with among others the Luapula s provincial minister, the province s permanent secretary and his deputy, the mayor of Mansa city municipal council, chairperson of the board of the seed company and Chief Nchengele of the Samya Community.Future visits to other countries in the are in the pipeline region with immediate focus on Botswana, Lesotho and Namibia.Tlhape said that the ultimate aim is to visit the entire SADC region.ELFAS TORERAIelfast@thenewage.co.za
