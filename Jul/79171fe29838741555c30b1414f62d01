The ANC commission on communication says whoever is responsible for the recent crisis that took place at the SABC should face criminal charges.This was said by PEC member of the Eastern Cape Stella Ndabeni, reporting on resolutions taken by the commission at the 5th ANC policy conference at Nasrec Expo Centre, which ended yesterday. We have discussed challenges at the SABC and the commission recommended that government must take responsibility after finalising all processes. If findings say one must be charged, we expect action to take place. She said the commission was concerned about the state of the public broadcaster, as corruption undermines government efforts of providing clean governance.The commission emphasised the importance of getting the best brains for any state-owned entity to avoid crises.This conviction was triggered by the recent crisis experienced at the SABC and other state-owned entities. Our report says the best way of avoiding what we have been through is to get only the best brains. These entities deserve the best, unless you say we don t have them, then lets go and find them somewhere, commission chairman, Jackson Mthembu said.The commission said there is a need to transform the ownership in the means of production in all value chains, including print, broadcasting and ICT. We can t have any industry in this country in the hands of a few blessed white males. The majority are black people in South Africa all industries must represent the country as it is today, Mthembu said.He said there was a need to protect and ensure that free-to-air television thrives and gets premium content rather than playing a second-fiddle role to pay television.Mthembu said as to how government does that would be it s responsibility. As the ANC we say we can t wait until December next year to migrate a broadcast signal from analogue to digital. We have lost opportunities from 2015 until now, we have to migrate immediately, it is in the interest of the country, Mthembu said.NTOMBI NKOSIntombin@thenewage.co.za
