Morocco&#8217;s king has rebuked ministers over delays to a development programme meant to pump investment into a region rocked by months of protests over unemployment and perceived state neglect.Mohammed VI told ministers Sunday of his &#8220;disappointment, dissatisfaction and concern&#8221; that the $670 million (600 million euro) programme in the northern Rif region was behind schedule, according to a cabinet statement.He also cancelled the annual leave of ministers involved in programme so they can &#8220;monitor&#8221; its progress, it said.The Rif&#8217;s main port, Al-Hoceima, has been rocked by protests since October, when a fishmonger was crushed to death in a rubbish truck as he tried to retrieve swordfish that authorities had thrown away because it was caught out of season.Calls for justice snowballed into a wider social movement dubbed Al-Hirak al-Shaabi, or the &#8220;Popular Movement&#8221;, demanding jobs, development, and an end to corruption in the mainly Berber region.The government responded by relaunching a 2015 programme to improve the region&#8217;s infrastructure, health facilities and education services by 2019.Interior Minister Abdelouafi Laftit said in early June that the projects &#8220;respond to 90 percent of the demands of the population&#8221;.But security forces have also arrested more than 100 people including Hirak leader Nasser Zefzafi, and clashes between police and demonstrators have continued.The Rif has long had a tense relationship with central authorities in Rabat, and it was at the heart of the Arab Spring-inspired protests in Morocco in February 2011.King Mohamed VI relinquished some of his near-absolute control through constitutional reforms following the 2011 protests.-AFP
