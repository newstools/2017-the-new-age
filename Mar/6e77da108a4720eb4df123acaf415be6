KwaZulu-Natal has taken the first step towards building a society that is receptive to people of all colours, creeds and races by launching a Culture Thursday campaign.Arts and culture MEC Bongi Sithole-Moloi said it was important to remind citizens that no man is an island and people should see themselves first as Africans before they slot themselves into their tribal identities.During the Culture Thursday campaign, people are encouraged to wear their traditional attire to speak their mother languages in the workplace and learn a new language.The learning of new languages is not only confined to learning African languages but also European and Indian languages as people originating from India, Pakistan and various European countries have also settled in South Africa.Shopping centres are also encouraged to allow traditional weavers to exhibit traditional wear to create a market for traditional attire.She said this campaign, beyond achieving racial and cultural understanding, will also help in dealing with recurring Afrophobic attacks directed at immigrants from other African countries.The MEC said the campaign aimed to stop the hatred of other people merely because they do not come from one s tribe or speak one s language.Sithole-Moloi said this was one of the many cultural initiatives the provincial government will be rolling out in its quest to create a better Africa where people will live in harmony and without looking at tribal leanings. The campaign is dubbed Culture Thursday. Through this campaign, we want to see cultures learning more about one another and we want to see people learning one another s language, Sithole-Moloi said.She said her department would identify commodities within the cultural sectors such as crafts and visual arts in orderto link them with economic opportunities. We are repositioning and re-engineering this sector to be an economic sector that has a potential to even contribute towards our gross domestic product as a country, she said.Sithole-Moloi also condemmed the recent xenophobic and Afrophobic attacks in parts of Gauteng saying it was an alien practice that must not be allowed to thrive. These are counter-revolutionary tendencies which stand directly in opposition to the values expressed by the African Union s 2063 agenda of an Africa we want, she said.SIHLE MAVUSOsihlem@thenewage.co.za
