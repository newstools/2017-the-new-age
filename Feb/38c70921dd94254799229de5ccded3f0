Montana residents are in for a treat and a social farm experience with the launch of the Cape Family Food and Farmer s Market.The market is 100% black owned and is being run and managed by three partners Nico Daweti, Ntuthu Mazwana and Lesedi Mokgatlhe.It aims to bring together the communities in and around Montana when it launches on March 4. Experience the culture of Cape Town and its people in the form of food, art, music, fashion and design in the beautiful and historic King David Country Club golf course, Daweti, who organised the event, said.He is confident that this is a place where people can deal with social cohesion issues as well as empower small business owners and create small business development in the communities. This would also create employment opportunities for the youth. We are focusing on all previously disadvantaged communities but because this initiative also seeks to address the issues of social cohesion, we opened the market for everyone representing the Cape cultures. We want vendors and customers to come from all races and genders representing Cape Town. We want Africans, coloureds, whites, Afrikaners, Indians and Muslims to present different cultures and cuisines, Daweti said.The event will also provide a farm experience in a laid-back environment with a treat of live performances in country music, classic pop music, Afro-pop and jazz, kwaito, sakkie sakkie and cultural music every Saturday from 10am until 6pm.It will feature a safe kids playing area and accommodate the elderly. Daweti said trade vendors can still apply to be part of the market for R150, with a trial run three days before the event to familiarise themselves with procedures.Those who would like to participate can contact Daweti at nico.daweti@ cfffm.co.za or 078008 8378 or alternatively, they can visit www.cfffm.co.za.KEITUMETSI MOTLHALEprovinces@thenewage.co.za
