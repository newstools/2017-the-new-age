Oakbay lawyer Gert van der Merwe has confirmed that the suspect who appeared in court today in connection with the so-called coup plot case could be the same one that tried to extort money from the Gupta family.Van der Merwe had told media that late last year the family had received a letter from a man last year asking for R30-million to assassinate the former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela, former deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas and former Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene. We did not know if it was a joke or not he told The Times. But my clients contacted me immediately on receiving the letter and I assisted them to draft a statement which was handed to the police with a request for immediate action to be taken. Van der Merwe confirmed to ANN7 that he believed that the alleged coup plotter, Elvis Ramosebudi (33), was the same man who had tried to extort the money from the Gupta family.The man is associated with two organisations, the Anti-State Capture Death Squad Alliance and the Anti-White Monopoly Capitalist Regime.It is the latter organisation which was said to be behind the plots against Madonsela, Nene and Jonas.
