Minister of Defense Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula says it is unfair to characterize the state as authoritarian following a decision to deploy members of the South African National Defense Force to the State of the Nation Address (SONA).Mapisa-Nqakula said that all their operations are informed by an intelligence gathered by the police.&#8220;For some of us who were in the liberation struggle, it is insulting to suggest that today we have an agenda to make the state authoritarian.&#8221;The Defense Minister has defended the decision to deploy members to the SONA saying it was not out of the ordinary.&#8220;There is nothing wrong with putting forces on stand-by when you have an event of this magnitude. We have done it before,&#8221; Mapisa-Nqakula said.The Minister clarified that the decision to deploy the 441 SANDF members follows a request by the Minister of Police.&#8220;At the request of the police, when they need assistance from SANDF, the military will be there to assist. We should remember that the SANDF is not just about shooting, wearing boots and carrying firearms,&#8221; she said.The minister highlighted that the SANDF had capacity to provide medical services in case of an emergency and also had bomb experts on hand in case of a threat.Mapisa-Nqakula added that, &#8220;In 2015 we had soldiers here, besides the ones on parade but they were not within the parliamentary precinct in the same way as today we will not have soldiers in the precinct.The Minister of Defense also rubbished statements made by Democratic Alliance Chief Whip John Steenhuisen that the deployment of soldiers was a sign of the Presidents paranoia.&#8220;Why would he be paranoid. He knows that he has served his two terms in government and come 2019 someone else will take over,&#8221; said Mapisa-Nqakula.-TNA Reporter
