Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho sent a clear message to French forward Anthony Martial on Wednesday, saying he needs to do more to impress him and comparing his approach unfavourably with that of team-mate Marcus Rashford.It was the latest example of Mourinho going public with his challenges to a player, after his recent criticisms of full-back Luke Shaw.Martial joined United in a 36 million-pound move from Monaco in 2015, but this season he has struggled to earn a regular starting place. Even with Zlatan Ibrahimovic rested on Sunday against Chelsea, the 21-year-old was left on the bench.Speaking before Thursday s Europa League quarter-final, second-leg against Anderlecht at Old Trafford, Mourinho was asked his thoughts on the France international and whether leaving him on the bench indicated he was not fully satisfied with him.&#8220;We are together now for almost 10 months and the same way I know the players much better now, the players should know me also much better now,&#8221; said Mourinho, who opted for Jesse Lingaard and Rashford in attack against Chelsea.&#8220;The same way I know what they like, I think they also know what I like. I have to go in the direction of the players and they have to come in my direction.&#8220;That is the point that is why Marcus Rashford, even without scoring goals, even without being without a Premier League goal since September, even with that, he was always a player that I trusted, a player that I played, was always a player that I support, because he was always coming in my direction, the direction of what I want from a player, what I want from a Manchester United player,&#8221; the United manager said.&#8220;It is about that we have to know each other better and better and go in the direction. Do I think Anthony has potential? Yes. Do I think he can play successfully for me? Yes, I think. But he needs to give me things that I like very much,&#8221; he said.Mourinho also said that Wayne Rooney could be back on the bench for Thursday s game if he comes through training on Wednesday without any reaction from an ankle injury.The fixture stands at 1-1 after the first leg.-Reuters
