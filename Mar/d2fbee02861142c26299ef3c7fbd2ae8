ANC struggle veteran Ahmed Kathrada is recovering at a Johannesburg hospital after he was admitted on Saturday for surgery related to blood clotting in the brain.Kathrada, 87, was initially admitted for dehydration but doctors later picked up the clot, which has subsequently been removed.Director of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation Neeshan Balton said Kathrada, despite his condition, was in good spirits. Doctors last night said the operation was successful and he is in a stable condition. However, it will be some time before Kathrada fully recovers, he said.Balton said that due to hospital regulations and the necessity for a relaxed period of recovery, only visits from the immediate family would be permitted. We do however wish to thank the public as well as Kathrada s many friends and comrades for their wellwishes and support. We hope that you continue remembering him in your prayers and take time to reflect on the ideals and values that Kathrada and his generation stood for, Balton said.Kathrada is one of three Rivonia Trialists still alive, the other two being Andrew Mlangeni and Denis Goldberg.Along with Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Govan Mbeki, Raymond Mhlaba and Elias Motsoaledi, they were sentenced in 1964 to life imprisonment on Robben Island during the infamous Rivonia Trial.news@thenewage.co.za
