THE ANC is pressing ahead in its political tussle with Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba.The regional ANC resorted to Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba to take up its fight with Mashaba over allegations of a misdirected city budget and a slew of irregular appointments at municipal-owned entities.ANC regional treasurer Geoffrey Makhubo said the party would submit a written request for Gigaba to intervene in the standoff between the ANC and DA over Mashaba s irresponsible conduct in the handling of the city s finances.Makhubo insisted the reappointment of Sol Masolo as the spokesperson for the power utility, City Power, was irregular. The financial situation of Johannesburg is dire and the city is on the brink of collapse as it has no money, he said yesterday. It is in the interest of Treasury and the government that this city should not collapse, he said. We will raise issues with facts and write to the minister. We will attach documentation urging the minster to look at the city finances to make an objective assessment. Makhubo s comments came in the wake of the ANC upstaging Mashaba s first year election anniversary on Tuesday.It insisted the city s coalition council flunked its year scorecard, scoring a mere 20% on performance. Makhubo referred to irregular appointments at the city s entities and said the ANC was in the final stages of compiling a dossier of these alleged irregular appointments, under Mashaba s watch.He said some of these appointments also concerned City Power. Makhubo also said Mashaba s inflated budget for 2017-18 threatened to plunge the metro s coffers into financial ruin .During his state of the city address earlier this year Mashaba said he tabled what he described as a pro-poor budget, in which he allocated R546m to electrify incomplete housing units in previously identified parts of the city.Mashaba s spokesperson Luyanda Mfeka, labelled the ANC s allegations as spurious at best and insisted Mashaba s handling of the metro s finances were above board.bonolos@thenewage.co.za
