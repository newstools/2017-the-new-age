Chelsea boss Antonio Conte said Monday that forward Pedro sustained &#8220;multiple fractures&#8221; to his face after colliding with Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina.The 29-year-old Spaniard was taken to hospital with a bloodied face after Ospina flew into him while clearing a ball with two fists during the Blues 3-0 pre-season win over their London rivals in Beijing on Saturday.Pedro spent the night in a Beijing hospital and returned to London the following day.Speaking to media in Singapore ahead of a friendly with Bayern Munich on Tuesday, Conte said: The situation was more serious because I hoped that it would only be a concussion.&#8220;Instead he had multiple fractures and I think with a mask in 10 days, he could come back to work for us.&#8221;Conte said there was no ill-feeling towards Ospina.&#8221;Absolutely no, because I was a player, I know these accidental (challenges) could happen,&#8221; said Conte. &#8220;Ospina tried to take the ball.&#8221;Ahead of the clash with Bayern, Conte confirmed that new signing Alvaro Morata is in line to make his first appearance for the Premier League champions.&#8221;In my plan it is to give him the possibility to play a part of the game against Munich for sure,&#8221; said the Italian.Spanish international Morata signed for Chelsea last week in a deal reported to be worth up to 80 million euros ($92 million).Asked about Diego Costa, the man Morata is likely to replace, Conte did not comment.He also refused to discuss midfielder Nemanja Matic, who has been strongly linked with a move to Manchester United.&#8221;I don t like to talk about players still here with us,&#8221; added the Chelsea boss.-AFP
