Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said he remained in the dark about his future after steering his side to a magnificent 2-1 victory over Chelsea in the FA Cup final.Chelsea were chasing a Premier League and FA Cup Double, but instead the double was Arsenal&#8217;s: a record 13th FA Cup success and an unprecedented seventh triumph in the competition for Wenger.Wenger&#8217;s future, which has been up in the air for months, will be settled at a board meeting on Tuesday, but the 67-year-old said he could not say for certain whether or not the club&#8217;s decision-makers will back him.&#8221;I don&#8217;t think I can answer that question at the moment,&#8221; he told reporters at Wembley after Saturday&#8217;s game.Wenger is reported to have been offered a new contract, but when asked if he knows what will happen, he replied: &#8220;No. I know my mind. Let&#8217;s enjoy the win tonight and not worry about the future.&#8221;Wenger was also dismissive of the notion that his record-breaking FA Cup success, after previous wins in 1998, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2014 and 2015, might have an impact on the talks about his position.&#8220;I believe that it&#8217;s a positive trend, but it would be ridiculous if 20 years depends on one game or the future of the club depends on one game,&#8221; he said.&#8221;I believe that I just want to do well for this club and apart from that I think it&#8217;s down to the board members.&#8220;Am I the right man to lead this club further? And for me to decide, am I the right man to lead this club further? It&#8217;s not about popularity, it&#8217;s about competence.&#8220;You cannot make 35 years at the top level if you believe you&#8217;re not the right man to do the job.&#8221;Wenger came under fire from sections of Arsenal&#8217;s support during a Premier League campaign that concluded with his team failing to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 20 years. Chelsea &#8216;have to improve&#8217; He described the criticism he had faced as a &#8220;disgrace&#8221; in a BBC interview broadcast prior to the final and returned to the theme after lifting the trophy.&#8221;I think this season has been hurt by some dip in March and I am convinced now, having looked back again at the season, we were hurt by the uncertainty about my future with the players,&#8221; Wenger said.&#8220;I know I am in a public job. I accept to be criticised and I accept people don&#8217;t agree with me. But once the game starts and you are a fan, you stand behind the team.&#8221;That&#8217;s what I did not accept during the season and I will never accept it.&#8221;Antonio Conte fell short in his bid to emulate Italian countryman Carlo Ancelotti by leading Chelsea to a Premier League and FA Cup Double in his first season as manager.He complained, with justification, that Alexis Sanchez&#8217;s fourth-minute opener for Arsenal should not have been allowed to stand due to a &#8220;very clear&#8221; handball, but admitted his team&#8217;s start &#8220;wasn&#8217;t good enough&#8221;.Despite having Victor Moses sent off after he received a second yellow card for diving, Chelsea levelled through Diego Costa in the 76th minute, only for Aaron Ramsey to head in Arsenal&#8217;s winner just three minutes later.While he hopes to add quality and quantity to his squad over the close season, Conte said Saturday&#8217;s result should not be allowed to tarnish the memory of Chelsea&#8217;s superb title triumph.&#8221;Next season for sure we must pay great attention to understand that we have to improve,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Numbers in the squad and also quality.&#8220;I think the players must keep in mind our fantastic season and also this final.&#8221;It&#8217;s a pity that we didn&#8217;t win the FA Cup, but don&#8217;t forget we had a big (performance) to arrive here and we must be proud of this.&#8221;-AFP
