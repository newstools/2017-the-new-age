Rights group Oxfam said South Africa is the most unequal society in the world where the richest 1%, has 42% of the country&#8217;s total wealth.Oxfam released its &#8220;Inequality Report&#8221; in Braamfontein, Johannesburg on Monday ahead of the 47th World Economic Forum Annual Meeting which kicks off in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland on Tuesday.Oxfam representative Ayabonga Cawe decried the state of inequality in South Africa and its impact on the wider population.Oxfam s report, An economy for the 99 percent , shows that the gap between rich and poor is far greater than had been feared. #inequality Oxfam South Africa (@OxfamSA) January 16, 2017&#8220;Three Billionaires have the same amount of wealth as the bottom 50% of South Africans,&#8221; said Cawe.&#8220;OxfamSA believes such inequality is the sign of a broken economy, and lack of will from government to change the status quo,&#8221; continued Cawe.Cawe added that the National Development Plan(NDP) does not adequately address the problems of South Africa&#8217;s structural political economy.According to Oxfam s report titled an Economy for the 99% , the growth of extreme inequality in South Africa gives the rich elite a means to undermine public services, minimum wages and other effective anti-poverty initiatives. The richest are accumulating wealth at such an astonishing rate that the world could see its first trillionaire in just 25 years. #wef17 Oxfam South Africa (@OxfamSA) January 16, 2017 &#8220;Women are often employed in low-pay sectors and face high levels of discrimination. If the current trends continue it will take 170 years for women to earn the same as men,&#8221; said Cawe.&#8220;Wealth continues to be funneled to a rich elite at the expense of the poorest in society, women,&#8221; continued Cawe.According to Oxfam analysis &#8220;over half the world s billionaires either inherited their wealth or accumulated through corrupt industries.&#8221;Last year Oxfam international published a report wherein they said that &#8220;the wealth of the richest 62 has increased by more than half a trillion dollars to $1.76tr.&#8221;Public anger with #inequality is already creating political shockwaves in the world.SA recorded number of violent public protests in 2013-16 Oxfam South Africa (@OxfamSA) January 16, 2017 It is simply unacceptable that the poorest half of the world s population owns no more than a few dozen super-rich people who could fit onto one bus,&#8221; said Oxfam International Executive Director Winnie Byanyima at the time.-TNA Reporter
