Axed SABC chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng yesterday said he would not relent in his efforts of advocating for social and economic change in the country.Motsoeneng said the country had yet to see the last of him following his recent dismissal from the public broadcaster. I may not be working today but I m enjoying it because I did what I was supposed to do. I m going to fight this battle so that there is transformation come what may, Motsoeneng said.He said he would still be calling for radical socio-economic development in the country. That s what we stood for and that is what we are going to die for and I ll lead that process. Motsoeneg s comments come as he recently revealed his presidential ambitions when he was a guest at pastor Mboro s Incredible Happenings church in Katlehong east of Johannesburg.Motsoeneng was fired by the SABC after being found guilty of misconduct for comments he made at a media briefing in which he criticised SABC board members and a parliamentary committee that was probing allegations of improper conduct against him.-TNA REPORTER
