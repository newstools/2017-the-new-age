The temptation for South Africans to hate on the Africa Cup of Nations tournament taking place in Gabon can be hard to resist since Bafana Bafana failed to qualify, but there is a lot to learn from the event.A celebration of African football is something that demands all Africans to support and neighbours Zimbabwe provide some hope at the showpiece.There are many reasons to watch. Chief among those should be to throw all the weight behind the Warriors of Zimbabwe, who opened their account with a 2-2 draw against Algeria.In fact, Zimbabwe will be very disappointed not to have won the match, considering how they managed to win when the two teams first met at the tournament back in 2004 in Tunisia, with Adam Ndlovu and Joel Luphahla scoring in the 2-1 victory.All South Africans will agree that unlike Bafana, Zimbabwe showed some serious bite, pushing the Foxes of Algeria to the finish line.The biggest reason, even though it counts heavily, is not that many of Zimbabwe s stars play and used to play their club football in the Absa Premiership, but because the two countries are neighbours.Despite their failure to beat Algeria, where African Player of the year Riyad Mahrez scored a brace to cancel out a lead that was established by former Mamelodi Sundowns man Nyasha Mushekwi, Zimbabwe have proved to have some of the best talent in the entire continent.Callisto Pasuwa s team have elements of a Dream Team, as they have one of the best attacks at the tournament led by the second best player based in Africa in the form of Khama Billiat, alongside goal getters Knowledge Musona and Orlando Pirates man Tendai Ndoro.Even Zimbabweans will agree this team is one of the finest since the days of Gilbert Mushangazike, Peter Ndlovu or Benjani Mwaruwari.To date, PSL players and coaches such as Tiyani Mabunda, Golden Arrows coach Clinton Larsen and Orlando Pirates keeper Jackson Mabokgwane have been among many to throw their weight behind Zimbabwe and this is not because they have Zimbabweans as team-mates. Zimbabwe have very good players that we know for sure. That team is strong enough to challenge at the tournament, Mabunda said before the tournament started. I will be supporting them and I hope they will do well to represent Southern Africa well. Even though they have talked about the embarrassment of being arguably the least paid players at the tournament, the Warriors gave a good account of themselves in their opening match and this is something great teams are made of.In what is only their third Africa Cup of Nations, Zimbabwe can afford to dream of making it out of the group stages for the first time after they finished bottom in 2004 and 2006.With such optimism, everyone in the South Africa will not be making a bad decision in standing firmly behind the Warriors.MMASEKEPE MATSEBANEmmasekepem@thenewage.co.za
