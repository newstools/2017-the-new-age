It&#8217;s all systems go for Miss SA Ntandoyenkosi Kunene, who jets off to the Phillipines today ahead of the Miss Universe beauty pageant. The Mpumalanga-born beauty queen will represent South Africa against 85 other countries at the Miss Universe pageant at the Mall of Asia Arena in Manila, Phillipines on January 30. The qualified teacher and model hopes to employ some of the good lessons she learnt during the Miss World beauty competition, which was eventually won by Stephanie Del Valle of Puerto Rico in the US last month. I learned a great deal from my participation in Miss World and I am really looking forward to the Miss Universe pageant and to meeting the other contestants from all over the world, she said. The University of the Witwatersrand graduate was crowned Miss South Africa 2016 at a glittering ceremony at the Carnival City Casino. The 2017 edition of Miss Universe will be broadcast live on Fox Network. Siyabonga Sithole|siyabongas@thenewage.co.za
