Gauteng Premier David Makhura is willing to appear before the provincial legislature s oversight committee.Makhura s office said this after the DA s Jack Bloom wrote to the committee for the premier s role to be probed following the release of Health Ombudsman Prof Malegapuru Makgoba s damning report on the circumstances surrounding the deaths of at least 94 mentally ill patients after they were relocated to various NGOs in the province. The premier knows that he is accountable to the legislature. He has appeared before the committee before and will appear if and when he is requested to do so, spokesperson Thabo Masebe said.The report found that the decision to relocate more than 1 300 patients from Esidimeni into 27 illegal NGOs was flawed and rushed.Former Gauteng health MEC Qedani Mahlangu, head of the department Tiego Selebano and director Makgabo Manamela were found to have played key roles in the disastrous relocation of patients.The trio were found to have acted improperly and negligently.A report said a total of 77 patients had already died when Mahlangu announced the deaths of 36 patients in the legislature in September.Bloom said he wanted the probe as the report stated that head of department Selebano said the decision to deinstitutionalise patients was taken by the office of the premier. This claim needs to be probed as well as the failure of the premier s office and the premier himself to effectively monitor the disastrous transfer of patients that led to the deaths, Bloom said.He said he had also requested a report from the premier s office which should include a time line of the decision process to relocate patients and for Makhura and his senior officials to appear before the committee for questions.A task team has been set up to do an audit of how many mentally ill patients remain in those illegal NGOs. Mahlangu has since resigned from office and charges have been laid against her while some families said they will pursue legal action.LERATO DIALEleratod@thenewage.co.za
