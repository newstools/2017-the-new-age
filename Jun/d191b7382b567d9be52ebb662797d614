Many black South Africans agree with me when I say &#8220;colonialism is not all bad , former DA leader and Western Province Premier Hellen Zille said in her submission.The disclosure was made by a source privy to the DA.The source alleged that Zille had no regrets following her tweet that suggested that there were aspects of colonialism that were not bad, and that there were some blacks who had no issues with her tweet.Party leader Mmusi Maimane had said Zille was suspended, but was later contradicted by the party s Federal chairperson James Self, suggesting rather that she had been asked to give reason why she should not be suspended.During an interview with Power FM today, Zille asked who Maimane was to rebuke her over a comment about colonialism, arguing that she had been targeted because she was not black.On the issues of her costing the party votes for refusing to step down, Zille said there was nothing to demonstrate her situation would cost the party votes. We&#8217;ve had three by-elections since this saga but the DA has had spectacular results, she said.The party leaders are expected to meet today to discuss Zille s future.-Sipho Jack
