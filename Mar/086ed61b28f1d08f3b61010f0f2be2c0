This negative behaviour plays a part in the preservation or destruction of our environment, thus the need to teach the next generation about greening and cleaning of their own settlements in order to make our environment healthier to live in. The dirty settlements and areas such as taxi ranks may cause social determinant diseases that may be a result of sewerage spills and bad waste management, Malakoane said.He said environmental awareness should be part of schools curriculum to instil the practice of nature preservation from an early age. The objective is the promotion of a clean and healthy environment in all selected municipalities through greening, cleaning and beautification exercises. Employment of annual contract workers in all the selected municipalities is to promote the concept of Community Parks by involving youth within the concept of the National Youth Service Corporations and the Youth Environment Service project, Malakoane said.He said it also created clean living spaces by inspiring communities to clean-up, fix-up and conserve their environment. The attitudes can be changed by raising awareness and educating the province on good waste management practices and encourage local municipalities to take part in the minimisation of waste in their towns, Malakoane said.The other winners: the schools competition award went to Sechaba se Maketse High School in Botshabelo who received laptops for pupils and teachers.The Petco company walked away with the best supporting company for waste recycling facilities, they were also honoured for their training and awareness programmes and donation of equipment to those recycling facilities.The cleanest ward went to Parys in Ngwathe local municipality while the best municipality in job creation through environmental projects was awarded to Maluti-a-Phofung.BECKER SEMELAbeckers@thenewage.co.za
