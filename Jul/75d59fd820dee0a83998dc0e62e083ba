The long-awaited commercial radio station Beat FM will soon start broadcasting on its new frequency, 105.20FM.Last year, MSG Afrika Group CEO and founder Given Mkhari announced the launch of two new radio stations.Rhythm FM, with an Eastern Cape footprint, and Beat FM, covering the Free State and the Northern Cape, will join the Johannesburg-based Power FM and Capricorn FM, which is entrenched in Mpumalanga and Limpopo.Beat FM is expected to be launched later this month and is to be based on the format of Capricorn FM.Mkhari says Beat FM aims to be a station for all race groups in the Free State and will broadcast 70% in English and 30% Sesotho.It is also expected to play 70% music from Afro-soul and R&amp;B to kwaito and house with gospel and jazz at the weekends.Capricon FM has done well and gained 1.5 million listeners since it was launched a few years ago.Mkhari, a former Metro FM talk show host who owns a number of media companies, is set to bring a new service to the province.Radio enthusiasts in the province are upbeat about the imminent opening of radio station.Itumeleng Mogapi said this was refreshing news for the radio in the province. We heard the station is about to open soon and this is indeed exciting news.We have always missed the element of commercial radio in our province, Mogapi said. We have had to rely on Gauteng based stations for quality programming. We certainly hope they will hire local talent because there is an abundance of that around the province, he said.Another radio fan, Granny Motile, said it would be interesting to have own commercial radio in the province. We have been yearning for a commercial radio station in the Free State for a very long time, particularly in the city of Bloemfontein. She said the new station will give the existing station a run for their money. We have only OFM and their market is predominately white. Though they have over the last few years tried to make inroads into the black market. So, we are elated by the news, Motile said.Attempts to get clarity from the station about the exact launch date drew a blank yesterday.MICHAEL TLHAKUDIprovinces@thenewage.co.za
