Police officers and reservists will be deployed as a force multiplier during the festive season to respond to farm murders and general safety in South Africa, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula said during a meeting with the leadership of the Transvaal Agricultural Union (TAU). The meeting, which was also attended by members of the Visible Policing Unit, was part of the minister’s ongoing engagement with different stakeholders in addressing safety in farms and rural communities. TAU president Louis Meintjes said: “We don’t need violence in SA. We need more police visibility on farms and we are willing to work with the police.” Mbalula said the police would do everything to curb farm killings. He also said there must be better cooperation and coordination between farmers and police, in particular at the station level, where crime is reported. He told the leadership of TAU that a national imbizo will be held before the end of the year to iron out plans to operationalise the rural safety strategy. Farm murders have been in the spotlight in recent weeks after thousands of South Africans gathered on October 30, in an event dubbed #BlackMonday. The gathering was sparked by the murder of Klapmuts farmer Joubert Conradie on October 24. Mbalula described the engagement as “fruitful”, as both sides agreed that farm killings are and must remain a priority. “We reiterate the spirit of the Freedom Charter that South Africa belongs to all those who live in it. “Police need to create a conducive environment for farmers to produce and ensure food security for all our people,” he said. kutullom@thenewage.co.za
