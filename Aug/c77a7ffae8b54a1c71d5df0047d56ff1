Political parties have unanimously agreed that all the current members of the SABC interim board be shortlisted to be interviewed for possible inclusion to the public broadcaster&#8217;s permanent board.This comes as Parliaments Communication committee today began the process of shortlisting 36 candidates from the 363 applications received.The call by MP&#8217;s can be seen as a vote of confidence in Krish Naidoo, Febe Potgieter-Gqubule, Khanyisile Kweyama, Mathatha Tsedu and John Matisson who were appointed back in March.Since the takeover, the interim board has reversed an editorial policy to ban the broadcasting of violent protests and has begun drafting a new policy to counter the 90% local content policy which it criticised as too drastic and the cause of significant revenue loss.The interim board&#8217;s term of office will officially come to an end on 26 September.Meanwhile, during today&#8217;s deliberations, a number of other candidates were shortlisted including Nomvuyoliso Batyi, Willie Currie, Dawn Earp, Deenadeylen Konar, Rachel Kalidass, Harriet Meier, Gonvinsamy Reddy, Michael Markovitz, Thabiso Ramotso and Kharidza Dzudzunga Rufus.During its meeting last week the committee decided that the names of the 36 shortlisted candidates would be published on the parliamentary website and allow the public five working days to comment.Parliament said that all shortlisted candidates will be vetted by an independent company.-Siphiwe Mchunu
