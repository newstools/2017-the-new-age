As SuperSport United challenge for silverware on multiple fronts this season, captain Clayton Daniels feels they have enough personnel in their squad to win every trophy on offer.Matsatsantsa are among the contenders for the Absa Premiership title, while their Nedbank Cup title defence remains on track and will face third-tier side KwaDukuza United in the last 16 of the knock-out competition.Start Baxter s men will also battle Liberian outfit Barrack Young Controllers next month for a place in the group stages of the CAF Confederation Cup. If you want to be among the best you have to face these challenges. If you want to challenge for cups you have to face this programme, Daniels said. But I think our squad is good enough to handle this and our technical team and coaches do as much as possible to recuperate the players, so I think we will be fine. Daniels said as players they will need to play their part if they are to win the league, defend the Nedbank Cup and go far in the Confederation Cup. We are professional players and we must do our jobs. We want to win each and every competition that we are in, Daniels said. In doing so, we have to respect teams like KwaDukuza United, they beat Ajax Cape Town at their home ground and we have to look at what they are. They are unknown to us but we are going to show them the respect they deserve.They made it to the last 16 and we are looking forward to playing against them. United, who are fourth on the Absa Premiership log standings, will meet Baroka FC at Mbombela Stadium when the league resumes this weekend.They have not won in their last two league matches having drawn against Orlando Pirates and Ajax Cape Town and cannot afford to drop more points at this stage of the season.NEVILLE KHOZAnevillek@thenewage.co.za
