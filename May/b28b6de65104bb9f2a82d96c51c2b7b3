A Dutch court will Monday hand down a ruling which could alter the future of the world&#8217;s leading paintmaker AkzoNobel, in the throes of fighting a takeover by a US rival.Disgruntled investors, frustrated that the Dutch company has rejected three offers from Pittsburgh-based coatings firm PPG, are seeking to force a shareholders meeting to try to smooth the path of a takeover.Led by activist investor Elliott Advisors, they have urged the Dutch Enterprise Chamber to rule in their favour and allow them to organise a meeting to vote on whether to oust AkzoNobel&#8217;s chairman of the board, Antony Burgmans, seen as the main obstacle to the PPG bid.The Amsterdam-based tribunal will hand down its judgement on Monday at 1600 GMT after the close of European stock markets. AkzoNobel, whose best-known brands include Dulux and Trimetal, earlier this month snubbed a third takeover offer by PPG, which valued the company at around 24.6 billion euros ($27 billion).By assuming the company&#8217;s debts and minority interests, the total value of the transaction would come to 26.9 billion euros, PPG said.AkzoNobel maintained the PPG bid undervalued the group and &#8220;contained significant risks and uncertainties&#8221; as well as failing to provide guarantees for its 46,000 workers.It has also stood by Burgmans, saying his dismissal would be &#8220;irresponsible, disproportionate (and) damaging&#8221;.But PPG has argued that a takeover would create &#8220;extraordinary value and benefits for all of AkzoNobel s stakeholders&#8221;.PPG&#8217;s chief executive Michael McGarry said last week the company preferred to negotiate a multi-billion-euro takeover of AkzoNobel, rather than mounting a hostile bid.&#8220;PPG remains very interested in persuing a consensual, privately negotiated, substantive deal with AkzoNobel,&#8221; he told journalists in Amsterdam.He said PPG&#8217;s board was likely to meet Tuesday to discuss the chamber&#8217;s decision.Under Dutch financial laws, PPG has until Thursday, June 1, to decide whether to mount a formal bid for AkzoNobel or walk away for a six-month &#8220;cooling-off&#8221; period.Based in Amsterdam, AkzoNobel was formed in 1994 from the merger of the Dutch and Swedish firms Akzo and Nobel.-AFP
