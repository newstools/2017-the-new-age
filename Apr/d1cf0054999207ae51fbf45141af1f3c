US President Donald Trump was back in Washington late Sunday, after attending Easter church services near his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, the culmination to his latest weekend away from the White House.The US leader and a retinue of family and aides, including First Lady Melania Trump and youngest son Barron, 11, arrived at Andrews Air Force Base a little after 6 pm (2226 GMT).Their motorcade arrived back at the White House several minutes later.Earlier Sunday, the first family attended Easter services at the Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea.Trump took a seat near the front of the sanctuary with his wife and her parents, along with his daughter Tiffany and Barron, as a choir sang hymns and the rector and other clergy made introductions and quoted gospel.Afterward Trump returned to Mar-a-Lago where, according to a White House aide, he joined sons Donald Trump Jr and Eric for brunch and an Easter celebration, which includes an Easter egg hunt for children.Earlier Trump sent out a celebratory message on Twitter: &#8220;Happy Easter to everyone!&#8221;The president&#8217;s weekend included several hours at his Trump International Golf Club on Friday and Saturday &#8212; his 17th and 18th trip to a golf course since becoming president on January 20, according to NBC News.Prior to his election, Trump had repeatedly criticized his predecessor Barack Obama for playing golf on weekends.Despite a profusion of tweets during his Mar-a-Lago stay, Trump has remained largely silent over the latest actions by North Korea, which included the rogue state&#8217;s display of what looked like new missiles or prototypes during a parade and the failed launch of a missile on Sunday.But Vice President Mike Pence, visiting South Korea, described the failed launch as a &#8220;provocation&#8221; and said he spoke by telephone with Trump, and declared that Washington&#8217;s &#8220;resolve has never been stronger&#8221; with regard to its alliance with South Korea.-AFP
