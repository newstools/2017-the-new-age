Santaco National Executive Committee (NEC) has resolved to suspend the anticipated national taxi strike pending the outcomes of the meeting requested by Minister of Transport Joe Maswanganyi.The meeting is scheduled to take place on Friday, in order to discuss issues.&#8220;The Santaco NEC convened urgently this morning to consider and determine whether the looming national taxi strike of, 12 July 2017, to the National Department of Transport should still go ahead,&#8221; Santaco said in a statement.The SAPS were on high alert for deployment of their personnel as Santaco announced for a national taxi strike next week.The strike that is planned for 12 July was expected to affect all taxi users countrywide.Last month, traffic was brought to a stand still in major Cities during the protest actions by taxi operators in Durban and Johannesburg.Entry to major highways were barricaded by taxis in the early hours leaving commuters and motorists stranded.Taxi owners handed over memorandums to Toyota in Durban and Midrand, Johannesburg containing their grievances. The taxi owners are protesting over the cost of the new Toyota Quantum minibus.Santaco says that the purchase and insurance of a Quantum calculations are set to cost owners about R1million, which is unaffordable.The memorandum handed to Toyota also accuses the taxi manufacturer of failing to contribute back to the taxi industry in the country.-TNA Reporter
