Parliaments Portfolio Committee on Communications has announced that 36 candidates will be shortlisted and interviewed for the 12 positions of South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) board members from the list of 363 nominations received.This comes as the committee today met in order to outline the process to be followed to shortlist the candidates.Committee MP&#8217;s decided that the names and CVs of shortlisted candidates be uploaded to Parliaments website in order to give the public an opportunity to comment on the candidates.&#8221; The public will be given five working days to comment on the list of shortlisted candidates. We are going to be guided by the Broadcasting Act. We must leave no legal holes and want the best of best to come and serve on the SABC board,&#8221; said Committee Chairperson, Humphrey Maxegwana.MP&#8217;s also decided that three days will be set aside to interview the shortlisted candidates.Maxegwana also announced that all shortlisted candidates will be vetted by an independent company contracted by Parliament.There is high expectation for the men and women who will ultimately be elected to serve on the public broadcaster&#8217;s board.They will be entrusted with turning around an organisation which faces severe financial constraints having recently announced that it will conclude the 2016/17 financial year with a net loss of R1.1bn.Back in June Communications Minister Ayanda Dlodlo told Parliament that revenue had declined by R353m in the 4th quarter and the drop was attributed to the 90/10 local content editorial policy, among other difficulties encountered by the public broadcaster.&#8211;Siphiwe Mchunu
