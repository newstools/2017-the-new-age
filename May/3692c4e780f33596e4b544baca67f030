The relationship between the ANC and its long-standing alliance partner Cosatu reached the breaking point yesterday following unprecedented disruptions of nationwide Workers Day rallies.President Jacob Zuma bore the brunt of the anger expressed by some Cosatu supporters, led by the federation s two major affiliates, the National Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) and South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu).Zuma was scheduled to deliver the keynote address at yesterday s main event in Mangaung.However, the event failed to get off the ground as Cosatu supporters chanted Zuma must fall .The event was cancelled, with the president leaving the venue.A similar pattern emerged in KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo where ANC national chairperson Baleka Mbete and deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte were also booed while speaking.Yesterday s rallies were used as a platform by Cosatu supporters to punt Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa as the federation s choice to lead the ruling party following its elective conference in December this year.Following the disruptions in Mangaung, leaders from the tripartite alliance did not shy away from voicing their anger.Free State Premier and ANC chairperson Ace Magashule described the behaviour as that of a mob mentality . We understand what is happening as the ANC, when the leadership is divided, they divide the membership, they divide society. This was not an ANC event, we were invited and what happened is an embarrassment, Magashule said.Although the SACP has been vocal about its hostility towards Zuma, the party s general-secretary Blade Nzimande said what happened at Loch Logan Park was sad and disappointing.He described it as the lowest point in the history of the alliance and they never thought that it would happen. I don t think we should disperse but as leaders we must see this as a final wake-up call, not for the sake of our organisation but for the sake of our country. We will have to come together to properly analyse this, debate and decide what is to be done, Nzimande said.He said the SACP was relatively clear about what it thought needed to be done, that at the very top level there needed to be a plan to unite structures. We know where the problems are, it is not that we do not know. We know there are problems of factions among others. Most people still have trust in this alliance and we shouldn t let it go. He said they could not go down in history as the generation of leaders that allowed an alliance of parties that fought for South Agfrica s liberation to die.Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini said they could not blame any of the alliance partners as he also witnessed the crowd booing the president. I am very disappointed at what happened. The crowd did not even want to listen to the MC, there was nothing that we could do, Dlamini said.ANC Women s League provincial chairperson Olly Mlamleli said some of the people who disrupted the rally were not from the Free State. We all know that this is a national rally. We will talk to Cosatu and do this rally again as the Free State and you will never see this happening, Mlamleli said, adding that women had travelled long distances to hear Zuma s message.Ignoring persistent booing, Mbete said disagreements within the tripartite alliance were not new and should be addressed internally.She urged those who were unhappy with the ANC to air their grievances internally rather than boo leaders publicly as it only served to make their enemies happy.Mbete was the main speaker at the Cosatu May Day rally at Durban s Gugu Dlamini Park yesterday.Duarte suffered the same fate at Polokwane in Limpopo.Duarte had earlier received a memorandum from the workers, together with the ANC Limpopo provincial leadership.beckers@thenewage.co.za
