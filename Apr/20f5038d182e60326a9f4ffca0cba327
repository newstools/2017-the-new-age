The ANC in Parliament has vowed to close ranks and vote against the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma brought by opposition parties.Last week the Democratic Alliance (DA) announced it will table a motion of no confidence in Zuma following his removal of Pravin Gordhan and his Deputy, Mcebisi Jonas from his cabinet.Parliament confirmed on Wednesday the motion will be debated on April 18.According to the ANC, since the motion was announced, its caucus members have received calls, text messages and emails from individuals and organisations attempting to lobby them to support the motion.&#8220;These calls are not only disingenuous, but also highly unfortunate as they seek to suggest that ANC MPs are free agents open to all sorts of mischievous lobbying and manipulation by the opposition and other forces.&#8220;The very same opposition making these calls have always voted along party lines yet they expect ANC MPs not to be guided and directed by their political party,&#8221; said a statement by the ANC Chief Whip.The office of the Chief Whip added that it will not support the calls for a secret ballot in the motion of no confidence.&#8220;There is no provision in the rules of the National Assembly for such a call. This call is therefore in violation of the laws of parliament as an institution and the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa,&#8221; the office of the Chief Whip said.Meanwhile the caucus has thanked former Minister of Energy Tina Joemat-Pettersson for her service following her resignation on Thursday.Joemat-Pettersson&#8217;s resignation follows that of former Transport Minister Dipuo Peters and Former Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas on Wednesday.&#8220;All these cadres of our movement have expressed their gratitude in having served the people of South Africa and thanked the ANC for having given them the opportunity to do so.&#8220;We are confident that they will continue serving the movement in other capacities in future. We wish them well in their future endeavours,&#8221; said the Chief Whip&#8217;s office.-TNA Reporter
