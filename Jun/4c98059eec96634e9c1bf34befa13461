Manny Pacquiao&#8217;s world title fight with Jeff Horn will be &#8220;short and sweet&#8221; with a knockout likely, his trainer predicted Wednesday, as his Australian challenger said he was &#8220;ready for war&#8221;.The legendary Filipino, one of the greatest fighters of his generation, is widely tipped to triumph over the unbeaten Horn in front of an expected 50,000 people at Brisbane&#8217;s Suncorp Stadium on Sunday.&#8220;He (Manny) doesn&#8217;t like to predict knockouts and so forth but I think it is going to be short and sweet,&#8221; trainer Freddie Roach told reporters at a press conference ahead of the World Boxing Organization (WBO) welterweight bout.&#8220;I think it won&#8217;t last too long and someone will get knocked out.&#8221;Roach on Tuesday suggested the fight was a stepping stone for the eight-weight world champion to secure a rematch with American rival Floyd Mayweather, who outpointed Pacquiao in the &#8220;Fight of the Century&#8221; two years ago.Horn&#8217;s camp hit back, with the former school schoolteacher&#8217;s promoters taking a dig at Pacquiao for spending most of the press conference looking at his mobile phone.&#8220;Not only is Manny Pacquiao an eleven-time world champion&#8230; he is also a world champion texter, because he never gets off his bloody phone,&#8221; Dean Lonergan said.Horn&#8217;s trainer Glenn Rushton accused Pacquiao&#8217;s camp of underestimating his 29-year-old challenger and said the so-called &#8220;Battle of Brisbane&#8221; would become the &#8220;fight of the year&#8221;.&#8220;My vision for this fight is it will be a late stoppage. I think it is going to occur late in the fight after&#8230; all of these rounds. I personally believe this will be the fight of the year,&#8221; Rushton said.&#8220;I do think Freddie and Manny are probably underestimating Jeff even though I know they say they are not because he is too experienced not to prepare properly.&#8220;But I do think when they get out there, it&#8217;s going to be so different. I think this will become Manny&#8217;s toughest fight&#8230; we&#8217;ve trained as hard as we&#8217;ve ever trained for this fight, so we&#8217;re ready for war.&#8221;Pacquiao (59-6-2, 38 knockouts) briefly retired last year before making a comeback to win the WBO welterweight title against Jesse Vargas in November, as he juggles boxing with his duties as a senator in the Philippines.-AFP
