Fresh fraud charges of R5.8bn laid against Mpumalanga coal baron Ramesh Joe SinghCONTROVERSIAL Mpumalanga billionaire pastor and coal baron Ramesh Joe Singh is facing fresh fraud charges totalling R5.8bn.Power utility Eskom has laid charges at Sandton police station.The fraud charges against the pastor, who claimed to have raised his son from the dead , is the second fraud case against him in less than six months.The fresh charges claim Singh under-delivered coal to Eskom and inflated the bill.Singh is already being probed by the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission for allegedly forging his former associate s signature to resign him as a director in two multimillion-rand companies in which they held equal shares.The companies, Lahleni Lakes and Finishing Touch, are responsible for a stalled R485m golf estate development in Mpumalanga.The golf estate development is at the centre of a court battle between directors Ralston Smith and Singh.Now Eskom is said to have appointed private investigators Magma Risk Solutions to help gather evidence against Singh.Khulu Phasiwe, Eskom s spokesperson, told The New Age the power utility was also doing its own investigation but declined to provide details. I can neither deny nor confirm the case but we are conducting our own investigations, he said.Peet Erasmus, CEO of Joe Singh Group, vehemently denied there had been a fraud case opened despite police confirming they were investigating the alleged fraud. Eskom has never demanded the amount of R5.8bn as alleged by you, or any other amount from Mr Singh or Mr Erasmus, nor does Eskom have any claims against them, Erasmus said.Erasmus said Singh and his group had a stable and healthy relationship with Eskom.Erasmus said the complaint does not originate from Eskom but from an unreliable source and Mr Singh has to date hereof not been informed of the investigation . These assertions by Erasmus are contrary to those of Const David Mothapo, spokesperson for Sandton police, who confirmed the fraud case was opened at the station. He confirmed the case number. I can confirm that a fraud case was opened but it was immediately transferred to the commercial crimes unit in Johannesburg on December 20, he said.The New Age has since established that a Col Baartjies and a Capt Ngobeni working at the commercial crimes unit were now handling the case but could not be reached yesterday for comment.Insiders close to the case yesterday said there was a possibility of the Witbank fraud cases and that in Sandton of being consolidated.Pastor Singh s cases in Mpumalanga are being handled by a senior public prosecutor at Witbank Magistrate s Court and investigation officer WO Rossouw.Singh is being investigated in Witbank and Middleburg for criminal matters under several case numbers.The two other cases, one relating to Middelburg, Finishing Touch, and the other Lahleni Lakes, were merged as the same suspects are involved in both cases.-SAMUEL MUNGADZE
