Protesting Huawei workers in Johannesburg have blocked Grayston Drive in Sandton on Wednesday afternoon after their contracts were allegedly terminated.Workers participating in the #HuaweiProtest claim they were simply complying with a request to return their work vehicles and had no intention of blocking the road.The fleet drivers claim to have been dismissed through a text message and requested to return their working cars back to the company.The protesters parked their working cars outside the Huawei offices waiting for management to attend to them causing a lot of traffic and a blockage on Grayston Drive.The gates to the premises remained closed while the workers outside vowed to remain outside throughout the night.&#8220;We were requested to return the cars, we are not barricading &#8230; We just wanted to go in and give in their cars but when we came in the morning JMPD blocked us out so we couldn&#8217;t get inside,&#8221; a protester is reported to have said.In posters held up during the protest the employees accused #Huawei of exploitation of workers, racism, corruption and exploitation through labour brokers.-TNA Reporter
