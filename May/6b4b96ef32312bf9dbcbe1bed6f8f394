President Nicolas Maduro on Sunday welcomed an offer by Pope Francis for Vatican mediation in crisis-torn Venezuela but opposition leaders rebuffed the overture.The pope&#8217;s call for a &#8220;negotiated solution&#8221; came in response to waves of protests by Venezuelans demanding new elections to pull the country out of a downward spiral.At least 28 people have died in protests since they began April, and hundreds have been arrested.&#8220;Dramatic news on the worsening of the situation in Venezuela keeps coming in with numerous deaths, injuries and prisoners,&#8221; the pontiff said before a crowd of 70,000 attending weekly prayers in Saint Peter&#8217;s Square.&#8220;United in sorrow with the families of the victims&#8230; I issue a sincere appeal to the government and all sectors of Venezuelan society to avoid all forms of violence henceforward,&#8221; said the pontiff.Urging respect for human rights, Francis said the Vatican was willing to act as a mediator under &#8220;clear conditions&#8221;.Maduro responded on his weekly program on state VTV television, pointing a finger of blame at the opposition.&#8220;If I say dialogue, they flee in horror. They don&#8217;t want dialogue. Yesterday they lashed out at Pope Francis. I respect what Pope Francis is saying,&#8221; Maduro said.He charged that the protests were an attempt to plunge the country into chaos, take over power and &#8220;impose a counter-revolution on Venezuela&#8221;.&#8220;There are no words for what they have done since April,&#8221; he said.The opposition walked away from talks in December, accusing the government of failing to fulfill promises to set up a timetable for elections and free political prisoners.Julio Borges, president of the opposition controlled National Assembly, said Sunday he would send a document to Pope Francis reaffirming the opposition&#8217;s demands centered on general elections.&#8220;The pope says some very interesting things. In the first place that, if there are no guarantees, there is no possibility of moving forward here,&#8221; he said.Saturday, former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles said dialogue might be nice, but not involving Spanish ex-prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. The former PM, who took part in an earlier mediating team, was not neutral, according to Capriles.Eight Latin American governments &#8212; Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, Paraguay and Uruguay &#8212; backed the pontiff&#8217;s proposal in a joint statement released Sunday by the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Sunday, a day before Workers&#8217; Day, Maduro increased the minimum monthly wage by 60 percent to the equivalent of 90 dollars at the official exchange rate; or 15 at the black market rate.Venezuela suffers from one of the world&#8217;s highest rates of inflation &#8212; forecast by the IMF to come in at 720 percent this year.-AFP
