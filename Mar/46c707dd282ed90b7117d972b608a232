Death threats sent to Villa Maria Primary School principal Lungile Ndlela, in the Maqongqo area near Pietermarizburg, may force the school to close its doors permanently as teachers fear going to school and have asked to be transferred to other institutions. If you know what s good for you, you better leave fast or you will die as the previous principal, a text message sent to Ndlela s phone from an anonymous number said.In August 2015, Ndlela s predecessor, Nokuthula Magwanyana, was found butchered to death in her vehicle along Table Mountain Road after receiving death threats.Since then, several teachers have left the school fearing for their lives as Magwanyana s killers have never been caught.The recently appointed Ndlela said she began to receive threatening calls and text messages after assuming the position last month.Ndlela said the calls were from an unknown man who threatened to kill her if she did not resign and leave the school.The latest threat has led to renewed fear among teachers at the school.A teacher at the school, Nokuzola Mchunu, said: As teachers, we are no longer safe in the school. We are afraid of teaching here after the previous teacher was hacked to death.I am applying to another school. A letter has been drafted and sent to the department of education, with a list of grievances, including the lack of safety at the school. Education MEC Mthandeni Dlungwana said he was aware of the threats and the fear among teachers at the school but assured them that he would make sure that the school was safe for the teachers and pupils. Dlungwana said the department had asked the department of community safety and liaison to assist in ensuring safety. We call for teachers to leave the matter to us and we are going to deal with it. We are also aware of teachers who have asked for transfers, he said.Meanwhile a local traditional leader, Nhlakanipho Maphumulo, called a community meeting at the school, which was attended by governing body members and officials from the education and the safety and security departments. If anyone from the community knows this perpetrator they must report it to the police. We cannot afford the closure of the school, Maphumulo said.Police said they were looking into the threats but no arrests had been made.XOLANI DLAMINI AND SIBONGISENI MAPHUMULOprovinces@thenewage.co.za
