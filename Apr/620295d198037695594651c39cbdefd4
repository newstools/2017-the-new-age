Prince&#8217;s estate moved Wednesday to block the release of several decade-old tracks, casting a cloud over commemorations of the pop legend&#8217;s passing.An independent label had announced plans to release a six-track EP of Prince songs, entitled &#8220;Deliverance,&#8221; on Friday which marks one year since The Purple One&#8217;s sudden death.But Prince&#8217;s estate, which is led by his siblings, quickly intervened and accused Ian Boxill, a sound engineer who recorded the tracks with the pop legend between 2006 and 2008, of violating an agreement.&#8220;Mr. Boxill is now trying to exploit the Prince recordings unlawfully in his possession,&#8221; said a lawsuit filed in a Minnesota court.The estate said Boxill had signed a confidentiality agreement that the music would &#8220;remain Prince&#8217;s sole and exclusive property.&#8221;Boxill, who has worked with an array of artists including slain rap great Tupac Shakur, sent a reply that was sealed by the court.In a statement announcing the music, Boxill said most proceeds would go to Prince&#8217;s estate and that the pop legend would have appreciated the independent release.&#8220;I believe &#8216;Deliverance&#8217; is a timely release with everything going on in the world today, and in light of the one-year anniversary of his passing,&#8221; he said in the statement.The first track, a rock ballad also called &#8220;Deliverance,&#8221; came out late Tuesday with the five other songs scheduled to be released digitally on Friday.Boxill said a CD release was planned in June.Prince died on April 21 last year at his Paisley Park estate in Minnesota from an accidental overdose of powerful painkillers.The 57-year-old &#8212; long considered a model of health who refrained from drugs, alcohol and junk food &#8212; died without leaving a will, setting off messy court disputes over the fate of his fortune.-AFP
