AS PLATINUM Stars face a daunting second half of the season, midfielder Robert Ng ambi says mental fortitude will see them through. Dikwena resume the fight to retain their Premiership status when they welcome Orlando Pirates at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium on Wednesday. But their focus will also be on their upcoming CAF Confederations Cup campaign, beginning this weekend.They also have the Nedbank Cup early next month where they come up against NFD outfit AmaZulu in the last 32. In the league, Stars are deep in the relegation quagmire 13th on the log with 14 points from 14 matches. They are two points away from the relegation trap, which is occupied by Baroka FC.Dikwena will host UD Songo of Mozambique in the first leg of the qualification round of the continental tournament on Saturday Ng ambi said there was nothing they wanted more than keeping the team in the top tier but they also aimed to excel in the other two competitions. We have to take every game as it comes and be mentally strong, I think that is something that will help us to survive, Ng ambi said. Nedbank is a tough competition no matter who you are playing against it always tough, there is CAF as well where we have to travel and the fact that we are in the bottom half of the log doesn t do as any favours, he said. We have to go out there and give our best performance for the team no matter what competition it is. The Malawian midfielder believes Stars problems are behind them. I think the problem was that we hadn t gel as a team with the new players and the youngsters were still trying to find their feet in the top flight so it took some time to get us in good shape, Ng ambi said.sithembisod@thenewage.co.za-Sithembiso Dindi
