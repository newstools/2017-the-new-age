Parliament has condemned the enslavement and horrific conditions under which close to 27 people were kept on a Wesselsbron farm in the Free State.The Select Committee on Economic and Business Development, Chairperson Mandla Rayi, said they were shocked to learn of the conditions under which the farm labourers trafficked from the North West were kept.Related: Farm slaves rescuedChildren as young as 13 were only paid R3 and had for years been eating carcasses from a nearby abattoir while the fresh meat was reserved for lions owned by the farmer. This behaviour of the concerned farmer needs to be condemned strongly and discouraged. Farmers should not conduct themselves in a manner that perpetuates anger and polarisation among our people along racial lines, said Rayi.Rayi added that they would raise the matter at its meeting with the Department of Labour today.A total of 2000 people were believed to have been trafficked to various farms in the area from the North West. Last week officials found elderly people, aged between 61 and 80, who were also forced to work as labourers on the farm.Rural development department adviser, Zondani Noveld last week confirmed that child labour and human trafficking cases had been opened against the farmer.&#8220;We will make sure that all other farmers who have taken children and elderly people are also arrested, Noveld said.He said they also contacted social development and other departments to come to the rescue of the children. All the children will be taken to places of safety, Noveld said.Meanwhile, the Committee is on a week-long joint oversight visit to the Free State, with the Select Committee on Trade and International Relations, to assess how government funded programmes in the province are stimulating local economic growth.-TNA Reporter
